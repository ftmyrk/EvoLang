Social Media Impact on Communication in the Modern World
In 2000, the internet had over 300 million websites (Tillmann 2000), and was still mainly used by geeks and computer nerds. People did not want the website names www.amazon.com to end up with them in a lawsuit. With websites on everyone's mind, the concept of social networking began to be considered as more than just a tool to share and update. The internet was becoming more and more advanced and with that there were several new programs and services for those that were interested. In 2004, Mark Zuckerberg was developing a program for Harvard students that would allow friends and classmates to share information easily, thus creating the idea of social networks (Vaccaro 2013). In addition to that, the new medium of texting allowed communication on a scale that had never been seen before, thus creating another medium of communication (Thorne et. al 2011).
Today, social media can have a huge effect on both the way that communication happens and also how one can be affected through it. There are two main sources of communication that are not directly on social media platforms; it is through websites that are on social media platforms that the actual communication takes place. For example, Facebook has been around since 2004, yet Facebook pages were not actually created until 2007. The reason for this may be so that users that are part of social networks are able to be connected to companies that they want to know more about (Schweighofer, 2012). These pages act as an advertisement for companies that are trying to get a word out to people that use social media as a..."
2013,Explain the role of artificial intelligence in healthcare.,"2013: Explain the role of artificial intelligence in healthcare. What’s happening in real healthcare, what we are doing to accelerate AI research, and what we see as the future of AI in healthcare.
The most exciting news in the AI world is the growth of companies. The pace of this growth was previously unknown, and we are now entering a very productive and exciting period with new entrants developing interesting ideas that have a positive impact.
But what does this mean for the future of medicine? It means more tools, including advanced AI, being applied to healthcare in ways that can really improve patient care and the value we derive from medical data. It also means the potential for major advances in understanding human behavior and in improving diagnosis and therapies.
We need a deeper understanding of all these new tools if we want to make healthcare work more effectively, as it is a critical problem area for the U.S. and the whole world.
In 2013, many new developments in AI are already having an impact on healthcare. Here are some examples: There is now a major effort to increase the amount and quality of data used for AI applications in medicine. There are also some new ways to apply AI to medical data that are more precise and faster than ever before. And there are even new applications for AI, such as a new AI-enabled diagnostic technology for early cancer detection.
One of the main problems with AI today is that there isn’t enough data available to use. One of the biggest challenges in using AI to help medical problems is the fact that there are no good datasets. But we are developing a lot of new tools for gathering and interpreting medical data, especially from patient devices. This will have a big impact.
This has implications for AI research in other areas, too. When we have data that is too small and difficult to manage, it makes it much harder to make big advances. This is why we have to invest in new techniques to get the best results in AI.
It’s also important to consider that AI will take on a new role in healthcare, as it already has in the commercial world. AI companies will continue to invest a lot of money into AI to develop systems that will improve our ability to use this technology and make more effective and efficient use of the data we have.
So in the end, we really need to develop new ways to analyze AI data, and then use that data to improve the quality of our medical care."
2013,Explore the challenges of space exploration.,"2013: Explore the challenges of space exploration. With the ISS a satellite orbiting the planet and the robotic missions of Mars getting more sophisticated and better results than ever before. Humanity's exploration of space has taken us from the Moon to the solar system itself but what lies beyond?
For all its scientific marvels, we can't pretend space is all glitz and glamour - what could be further from the truth! There is a serious side to space exploration too - from the dangers astronauts have to face just from being in space, and the long list of failures that have come before successful manned missions, to the difficulties that engineers have in sending payloads into orbit. It's all very complex, as well as being expensive and ultimately a dangerous venture into the unknown. So what can we look forward to in terms of space exploration in the years ahead?
NASA plans to get its next space station into orbit in 2018, although this is no longer to be manned. The space station that launched in 1998 will return to Earth, de-orbiting in 2018. Then it could remain in space as a station, only visited by unmanned vehicles, or sent to land in the ocean, becoming a floating debris field which will be an object of curiosity to generations to come.
And when astronauts will land on Mars? Well it'll be a long time yet according to the current mission planning - between 2020 and 2030 according to some - although this is a very conservative estimate and NASA may well decide to speed it up. However, it's highly unlikely that in 50 years' time we will have landed a human on Mars! What we will have, though, is an orbital platform called Mars City and a Mars One, a floating base on the surface of the red planet.
It's a bold move and a long shot - but it's an aim that many people will hold on to and a very worthwhile one at that!

2013,Describe recent advancements in renewable energy technologies.,"2013: Describe recent advancements in renewable energy technologies. Be sure to include specific details such as the material that they are made of, as well as their pros and cons for both the environmental and economic impacts. Finally, describe any current problems or concerns with renewable energy technologies and possible solutions.
It is an imperative that humanity works in order to find new renewable sources of energy if the Earth is to be sustained in the long term. Many countries have seen an increasing need to transition away from the conventional fossil fuels that dominate the power supply. However, the process of moving towards a greener energy sector is not as simple as one might believe it to be. A range of different renewable energy resources can be utilized by countries across the world, some of which include hydroelectricity, wind power and solar panels to name but a few (Nelson, 2013). All of these renewable sources have been utilized to varying extents by the countries across the world (Buchanan and Wiser, 2007). They have all played an essential role in reducing the impact of fossil fuels on the environment, whilst also improving energy access around the globe.
This report analyses the use of biomass and solar energy by the United States over the past 20 years. The main factors are explored which may have led to the country utilizing different renewable resources, and the pros and cons of these are evaluated with respect to sustainability.
The use of biomass in the United States
The United States is one of the world’s largest economies with GDP (gross domestic product) being worth $14.6 trillion in 2011 (The Economist, 2011). With such a high GDP, it is important that the country develops in an environmentally friendly manner so as to not damage the Earth in the future. With this in mind, the US government has become concerned in reducing the amount of energy imported from fossil fuel. As a result, the government has put a strong focus on developing sustainable sources of energy. The majority of the power produced by the US currently derives from coal with the next largest contributor being natural gas. However the US has a strong interest in developing the use of bio-energy. Currently 2% of all energy used in the country derives from bio-energy (US Energy Information Administration, 2011). However the US Department of Energy is aiming to increase this by a factor of two over the next ten years. Although coal produces a large amount of electricity, this process produces pollutants such as sulphur dioxide, particulate matter and carbon dioxide. As a result there is"
