He was speaking to a supportive group of border guards and Texas Governor Greg Abbott. ""The biggest threat to our country isn't the Chinese Communist Party. It's the invasion of our country by these gangs of thugs,"" he said.
Abbott said that Biden had ""abandoned the border,"" and that it was up to the state government to secure it.
While Biden has increased border patrols and deployed additional troops, the number of migrants who enter the US has increased under his presidency.
According to the Border Patrol, more than 2 million people were caught trying to cross the US border illegally in 2022. That is the highest number of arrests since 2006, when the agency was tasked with controlling the border.
The Biden administration has acknowledged that the numbers of illegal immigrants and asylum seekers arriving at the border are unprecedented.
Critics argue that the administration has not done enough to secure the border and that the rise in migrant numbers is a sign of a weakening national security.
The Republican leadership has made securing the border a priority in the midterm elections, calling on voters to choose candidates",-679477248.0,-687865856.0,8388608.0
