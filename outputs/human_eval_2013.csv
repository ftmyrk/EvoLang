Sat Apr 27 2013 - 06:00 An oil executive was yesterday branded a liar for evidence he gave in a multi-million pound tax case taken by Tullow Oil in London. The chief financial officer of Heritage Oil, Paul Atherton, was described as a “patently dishonest witness” as Tullow closed its legal battle over a £209.5 million tax bill. He was said to have lied under cross examination, as the court was urged not to accept anything he said unless it was corroborated by another witness. Tullow’s lawyer, David Wolfson QC, said: “He was a patently dishonest witness, and that is not a submission I enjoy making. “Quite apart from the fact that he took an oath, there really was no need for him to lie about anything. READ MORE Tullow is seeking to recover a tax bill it paid in Uganda on behalf of Heritage. It had been suggested during evidence that Tullow executives discussed paying a bung to Ugandan president Yoweri Museveni, based on an email sent between Tullow executives. But Mr Wolfson said the document in question contained “no hint of any suggestion” that a payment would be made to the president. He said the allegations against the president had caused “serious ongoing issues” in Uganda. 'Irrelevant' ""Heritage's insinuations were irrelevant to the issues that arose in the case,"" he said. Tullow has brought the case against Heritage after paying $1.45 billion for a 50 per cent share in three huge Ugandan oil fields back in 2010. The Ugandan government then demanded $313 million from Heritage in capital gains tax on the deal. Tullow said it was then forced to pay Heritage’s disputed tax bill so that it could secure approval on the sales of two 33 per cent interests in the fields in early 2011. It is suing Heritage for the return of the tax money, claiming the smaller firm should have ultimately footed the bill. If Tullow can prove it believed the claim from the Ugandan government to be legitimate,it will win the case. Kwahar Quereshi, representing Heritage, later yesterday accused Tullow of colluding with the Ugandan government in making its tax claim against his client. “Tullow’s collusion with the Government/URA, in terms of both the time period and scope of the matters involved, was as wide ranging as it could have been.” He attacked company secretary Alan Graham Martin for destroying key documents in the build up to the case, which may have detailed this collusion. Documents destroyed Mr Martin admitted destroying documents during his cross-examination, saying he ""got rid of a lot of notes when [he] left Kampala"". He said the notes were crucial in determining whether the company had changed its mind on the validity of the tax claim made against them, as well as providing any evidence of collusion with the Ugandan government. He claimed Tullow was trying to rely on a draft document of legal advice from a Ugandan lawyer as evidence it believed the tax claim was valid.

"Critical Infrastructure Protections Include Employee Information Subscribe Now ! My Account Sign In Sign Out Home :: Security :: Library :: News :: 2013 :: April :: Military WMD Intelligence Security Menu Systems Industry Operations Hot Documents News Reports Policy Budget Congress Links Space Homeland Security Critical Infrastructure Protections Include Employee Information By Claudette Roulo American Forces Press Service WASHINGTON, April 22, 2013 – President Barack Obama's February executive order requiring federal agencies to improve cybersecurity protections for critical infrastructure means the Defense Department will be sharing more information with the defense industrial base, Michael E. Reheuser, the director of DOD's Privacy and Civil Liberties Office, said April 19. ""The cyber threat to critical infrastructure continues to grow and represents one of the most serious national security challenges we must confront,"" the president wrote in his order. ""The national and economic security of the United States depends on the reliable functioning of the nation's critical infrastructure in the face of such threats."" The information sharing is intended to safeguard vital defense information shared with or held by the defense industrial base, Reheuser said in an interview with American Forces Press Service and the Pentagon Channel. ""The way we do that is provide them information that they can use ... to prevent persistent attacks that have been levied on almost every business in the United States,"" he said. In the past, that information wasn't always freely shared, Reheuser said. ""So, the president's executive order is encouraging DOD and other agencies to share that information with the companies so that they can better protect their information,"" he explained, ""so the nation as a whole won't be subject to as many attacks and the scope of the attacks won't be as significant."" According to the executive order, critical infrastructure includes systems and assets so vital to the United States that their failure or destruction would have a debilitating impact on security, national economic security, national public health or safety. The Defense Privacy and Civil Liberties Office is responsible for making sure that these information-sharing programs take into account the privacy and civil liberties of DOD employees and defense contractors, Reheuser said. ""So, for example, we want to make sure that we're not having any government monitoring of emails of personnel that don't work for the Department of Defense,"" he explained. Not only do DOD employees sign user agreements when they receive an email account, Reheuser noted, but each time they sign on, a banner explains their rights as a user of a defense information system. 'We [DOD employees] understand that our emails and other information on the computer -- because it's a government system -- can be monitored, and that monitoring consists of ensuring, for example, that classified information does not leave the network,' Reheuser said. While those rules apply to DOD employees, he said, the government does not monitor the systems of defense contractors. ""And under no program is that going on,"" he added. The DPCLO will assess the DOD's information-sharing programs to ensure that privacy and civil liberties protections exist and are fair, Reheuser said. That assessment will be delivered to the president next year as part of a joint report with the Department of Homeland Security, he added.

"USA TODAY Skip to main content Home U.S. Sports Entertainment Life Money Tech Travel Opinion For Subscribers Weather Investigations Crosswords Humankind Newsletters Media For You Contributor Content Court says states can restrict access to public records Richard Wolf, USA TODAY |  USATODAY WASHINGTON -- States may have little reason to restrict public records access to their own residents, but the practice is not unconstitutional, the Supreme Court ruled Monday. The unanimous decision, allowing Virginia to favor its residents under its Freedom of Information Act, goes against media organizations and professional data miners that had sided with the law's out-of-state challengers. During oral arguments in February, several justices had questioned whether the state's law served any purpose, since non-residents can hire residents to get information. In his ruling, Justice Samuel Alito noted much of the data is available on the Internet. Still, Alito said, the state law ""did not abridge any constitutionally protected privilege or immunity"" because access to public records is not a ""fundamental"" privilege, such as employment. While the Constitution's privileges and immunities clause ""forbids a state from intentionally giving its own citizens a competitive advantage in business or employment, the clause does not require that a state tailor its every action to avoid any incidental effect on out-of-state tradesmen,"" Alito said. The decision had been expected, since most of the justices' questions during oral argument focused on the rights of states to favor their own residents. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg noted states can restrict who votes in their state. Justice Antonin Scalia said perhaps the state ""didn't want outlanders mucking around in Virginia government. Why isn't that reasonable?"" The federal government and all 50 states have laws giving people the right to inspect some government records through the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). The laws are used by journalists, researchers and a growing industry that mines data from government records, which are used to do everything from selling real estate to setting credit scores. At least seven states restrict that right to residents of the state. Their laws are protected by the Supreme Court ruling, but it doesn't necessarily extend to other state laws that treat residents differently from non-residents. The challenge to Virginia's law began when Mark McBurney, a Rhode Island resident who used to live in Virginia, asked state officials for copies of records he hoped would shed light on why they hadn't enforced an order requiring his wife to pay child support. Officials rejected his request because he had moved to Rhode Island. McBurney and another man, Roger Hurlbert of California, sued, arguing that the residents-only limit violated the Constitution's privileges and immunities clause and amounted to an improper restriction on interstate commerce. Gannett Co., USA TODAY's parent company, joined an amicus brief asking the court to invalidate Virginia's residents-only provision.

According to reports in the Canadian media, iGate was allegedly using temporary foreign workers to replace the bank’s existing staff. The US-headquartered iGate has been providing IT outsourcing services to RBC for almost eight years. The company had also set up an offshore development centre for the bank out of its facility in this city. A report last week from the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation had said RBC planned to retrench about 50 employees at its investor services division in Toronto, since the work was being done by iGate. Following the report, the Canadian government said it would review a temporary foreign worker programme. The programme allows employers to fill jobs with non-Canadians when qualified citizens or permanent residents are not available because of skill and labour shortages. “The programme was never intended as a means to bring in temporary foreign workers in order to replace already-employed Canadian workers. This is why we have launched a review,"" Human Resources Minister Diane Finley had said. In a statement issued today, iGate said it did not comment on specific client engagements. However, it said, it strictly adhered to all laws of the land and immigration policies in whichever country it operated. “For any engagement requiring foreign workers, in any country, iGate provides the appropriate information to the relevant immigration authorities as may be required for the issuance of temporary work authorisations and hiring is only done after all work authorisations are properly issued under existing law and policy,” it added. A little over half of iGate’s revenue comes from the banking, financial services, insurance and healthcare segments.

Humanlike Robot 'Petman' Ready For Battle Against Chemical Warfare [Video] Print This Article Send This Article By Peter Lesser ( staff@latinospost.com ) | 			First Posted: Apr 06, 2013 11:57 AM EDT Tags Petman , BigDog , Boston Dynamics For those who fear that some day robots will rise to power and destroy humanity, today is a frightening day. The creators of the BigDog robot have now introduced their most recent creation. The previously headless "" Petman "" anthropomorphic robot is now fully dressed and equipped with a head on its shoulders. The robot's creators, Boston Dynamics, built Petman to help test protective clothing for battle, whereas they designed BigDog for actual combat. Petman is dressed with the latest hazardous materials or bomb suits and then struts its stuff to test the outfit's durability, flexibility and effectiveness. However it does seem a bit superfluous, as any man could perform the same tasks, unless, of course, scientists actually exposed the robot to toxic chemical warfare agents to further test the battle suits. Well, that's exactly what they do. In addition to Petman's humanlike range of motion, the robot also sweats and emits heat to get a better handle on the effectiveness of the combat suit. It's also rigged with temperature and chemical sensors that scientists can then compare to normal human body limits. From there, they can determine if an actual person would have suffered from heat exhaustion or overexposure to the deadly chemicals. Boston Dynamics' research is funded by the Defense Department's Chemical and Biological Defense program. BigDog and Petman are two of the research company's primary projects, but also keep an eye out for Atlas robot, which will have its own demonstration video sometime later this year. BigDog, designed for the battlefield, runs at 4 mph, climbs slopes up to 35 degrees, can walk across rubble, trudge through mud, walk in snow and water, and can carry a 350 lbs. on its back while doing it. It's powered by an engine that drives a hydraulic actuation system. It has four legs, like a dog, is about three feet long, two and a half feet tall, and weighs in at roughly 240 lbs. Its control system keeps it balanced and includes sensors for joint position, joint force, ground contact, ground load, a gyroscope, LIDAR and stereo visions system. It's man's best friend on the battlefield. With each passing day, robots become more sophisticated. While these improvements can help keep humans safe, especially in combat, it's worrisome to watch them adapt and further resemble humans. Robots like Petman are so eerily humanlike that one can't help but think their capabilities will some day surpass our control.

"Putting HIV Patients at the Center - South Africa | ReliefWeb Skip to main content Help Log in ReliefWeb Content Search What are you looking for? Search|t Updates Countries Disasters Organizations Topics Jobs Training Informing humanitarians worldwide 24/7 — a service provided by UN OCHA South Africa Putting HIV Patients at the Center Format News and Press Release Source Gates Foundation Posted 11 Apr 2013 Originally published 10 Apr 2013 Origin View original BILL GATES April 10, 2013 Experts have long recognized that there is no “one-size-fits-all” approach to HIV services. The features of the global HIV epidemic vary by country, often by community and patient, and it’s important to understand these distinctions so that we can design programs to meet people’s needs and strengthen their access to treatment and prevention. A few months ago, I had the opportunity to meet Craig Househam, who heads the Department of Health in the Western Cape, one of South Africa’s nine provinces. We talked about how his department is delivering health care to the thousands of people living with HIV in the townships and rural areas surrounding the city of Cape Town.  I was really impressed with the approach that Professor Househam and his team have created in the Western Cape, and I want to share some of the lessons that I think can be drawn from it. One thing that the system does well is to tailor the support provided to each HIV patient by offering different tiers of engagement with the health system. In many countries, all HIV patients are expected to have the same level of engagement with the health system, regardless of their needs.  That generally means monthly medical appointments with a doctor or high-level nurse at a central hospital. For many people living far from facilities, these trips often take an entire day due to lengthy travel and significant wait times. For the majority of patients who are generally healthy and responding well to their medications, this level of engagement with the healthcare system may be burdensome and  actually discourage patients from remaining in care. For others with more complicated cases, this standardized level of care may be insufficient. In the system in the Western Cape, healthy patients who are adhering to their anti-retroviral (ARV) treatment can pick up their medicine every two months from local service organizations rather than from a central hospital or clinic. Qualified pharmacists sort and package the medications, and then they are delivered to patients by mid-level healthcare workers rather than doctors or nurses. This lets people access quality services in their own neighborhood, reducing the burden on them and on the health system overall. To ensure that people are staying healthy and not developing resistance to their treatment, the Western Cape schedules everyone for an annual clinical exam with a highly qualified nurse. If there are problems, patients are immediately referred to a doctor for further examination. I was also impressed by how the Western Cape collects the data required to understand which level of engagement is appropriate for the individual patient. They are phasing out their paper-based records and adopting an electronic health record that creates individual e-files for patients and links their lab results, hospital records, and other information under one file that can be accessed wherever an individual seeks care. Why am I so excited about this approach? First, this system takes into account the specific needs of the individual receiving care.  By providing patients only the level of care they need, it leaves them more time to devote to their jobs, their families, and their communities. Second, it enhances the impact of scarce healthcare resources – financial, human, and technical. By reducing the cost and effort while still keeping thousands of people healthy, it frees up resources that can be directed toward more specialized care for those who need it - or toward expanding access to treatment for those who don’t have it. Third, the Western Cape’s approach uses smart IT solutions to meet patients’ clinical needs and providers’ logistical needs.  It is preparing the way for an even more efficient, patient-focused health records system that can facilitate a better managed HIV treatment system at a lower cost to the public.  This is especially important in countries like South Africa, where many patients might be on the move; electronic records can follow a patient much more easily than paper ledgers. Approaches like these remain critical in our efforts to turn the tide on HIV. We have made huge progress against HIV in the past decade, thanks in no small part to programs like PEPFAR and the Global Fund for AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria. The cost of ARV medicines has fallen by more than 99 percent, and more than eight million people now have access to lifesaving treatment. But we still face a situation where only half of all people who could benefit from HIV treatment are actually receiving it.

The government, which also released a raft of economic reforms, said the country would return to growth in 2014. It also said its deficit would be brought below the European ceiling of 3% of GDP in 2016, two years later than initially expected. Unemployment, which this week rose to 27.2%, with more than 6 million people currently unemployed, would remain at a high level over the next two years at 27.1% in 2013, 26.7% in 2014 and 25.8% in 2015. At a press conference following the adoption of the new economic plan, Deputy Prime Minister Soraya Saenz de Santamaria said the government would not need to pass major new reforms, tax hikes and spending cuts to meet the new targets. She said the government, which had to backtrack from its pledge to cut taxes as soon as next year, was still aiming at cutting the income tax in 2015. While consumer and energy taxes would remain unchanged, the government will review the corporate tax, she said. Economy Minister Luis de Guindos said the new deficit-cutting path as well as the growth targets had already been agreed with the European Commission and euro zone peers and insisted Spain was on the right track. ""2014 will be the year of recovery,"" he said. Before the plan was adopted, Europeans officials had told Reuters the issue of giving Spain more leeway to cut it spending gap was still intensely debated in Brussels and would probably not be resolved until May 29 when the European Commission is due to announce its decision. A heated debate about Europe's austerity drive has flared back into life this week and Spain is widely seen as a taste case for Europe's economic policy. Rajoy, a keen advocate of austerity in his first year in power, had tried since February to find a middle way between the pro-austerity and pro-growth camps, saying Spain would always be disciplined on spending but indicating that he would also now lean more to stimulating growth. The new plan would stick to this strategy.

"Panel reading bill that fines tech firms that disobey wiretap orders - UPI.com Top News U.S. News World News Featured Odd News Entertainment Movies Music TV Science Health Sports NFL MLB NBA Soccer Voices Photos News US News World News Entertainment Sports Archive Almanac Advertisement U.S. News April 29, 2013 / 6:15 AM U.S. panel said to push to bolster law on wiretapping WASHINGTON, April 29 (UPI) -- A U.S. task force is readying a bill that would pressure Facebook and other Web firms to comply when law enforcement wants to wiretap online, officials say. The plan, which the Obama administration hasn't signed off on, would exponentially fine companies that don't comply with wiretap orders, The Washington Post reported Monday. Advertisement The effort is driven by FBI concerns it can't tap online communications of terrorists and other criminals, as people increasingly communicate online instead of by telephone. Federal officials typically back off when a company like Facebook or Google resists cooperating with federal law enforcement and national security officials, the Post said. Related Police need warrant to seize text messages Contractor charged for sharing U.S. info Agent: Bomb suspect had chance to back out Officials say suspects' growing online activities represent what the FBI calls a ""going dark"" problem and this means critical evidence can be missed, the Post said -- citing current and former U.S. officials familiar with the effort by the task force that includes officials from the U.S. Justice and Commerce departments as well as the FBI and other agencies. ""The importance to us is pretty clear,"" FBI General Counsel Andrew Weissmann told the American Bar Association at a discussion last month on legal challenges posed by new technologies. Advertisement ""We don't have the ability to go to court and say, 'We need a court order to effectuate the intercept.' Other countries have that. Most people assume that's what you're getting when you go to a court,"" he said. Weissmann said the issue was the FBI's top legislative priority this year. The task force began its work in 2010, The New York Times reported at the time. It would seek to strengthen and expand the Communications Assistance to Law Enforcement Act of 1994, the Times said. The 1994 law says telephone and broadband companies must modify or design services so they have built-in surveillance capabilities allowing federal agencies to monitor cellphone, broadband, Internet and voice over IP communications immediately after being presented with a court order and in ""real time."" Voice over IP is the type of Internet protocol Skype uses for its communications. Real time refers to the actual time something takes place. Under the latest draft proposal, a company that doesn't comply with a wiretap order within a certain period would face an automatic judicial inquiry, which could lead to fines, the Post said. After 90 days, unpaid fines would double daily, the newspaper said. The FBI and White House declined to comment. Advertisement The bill wouldn't dictate how the wiretap capability is built -- it would let companies figure out how they want to do that, provided they provide the information the government wants, the Post said. Greg Nojeim , a senior counsel at the Center for Democracy and Technology, which focuses on issues of privacy and security, called the proposal ""a non-starter that would drive innovators overseas and cost American jobs."" ""They might as well call it the Cyber Insecurity and Anti-Employment Act,"" he told the Post.

"Why you should avoid gut instincts to make business decisions - The Globe and Mail Skip to main content Search Newsletters Watchlist Home Watchlist For You Canada World Business Investing Personal Finance Opinion Politics Sports Life Arts Drive Real Estate Latest in Subscribe Digital access Digital + home delivery Why you should avoid gut instincts to make business decisions commentary Why you should avoid gut instincts to make business decisions CHRIS GRIFFITHS Special to The Globe and Mail Published April 9, 2013 This article was published more than 11 years ago. Some information may no longer be current. Share When it comes to running a small business, I don't have a lot of regrets. The few I do have usually revolve around looking back and realizing that I had access to many facts and figures that I ignored, relying on gut instincts instead. If I had paid more attention to them, I would have made better decisions than the ones I made acting too hastily on what my gut told me to do. This happens to many small business owners more often than it should. While they have every right to rely on their instincts and intuitions to make strategic decisions or overcome an emergency, they may be overworking their gut. Gut instincts certainly helped to shape the person you are and the business you created, but you really should rely on them only when necessary. Taking time to slow down, collect facts and see a decision from all angles before actually making it can help you see opportunities that you might otherwise overlook. While this takes a lot more time, patience, discipline and, often, expense, it is almost always worth it. I was reminded of this recently when I was at a client's manufacturing facility and was asked my opinion about moving a major piece of equipment to a new location in the plant. I spent a good 30 minutes discussing with the principals the pros and cons of keeping it where it was or moving it, and they wanted my recommendation. All of our gut instincts told us that a move of the equipment would be the right move. But there were still many facts and figures that had not yet been examined or needed a deeper dive. I needed to postpone the decision to make the right decision. And to do that, I needed to turn to one of my favourite management techniques, which I call the ""choiceless decision."" Quite simply, it's the decision where you have no choice but to reach the right one. Because once you pay attention to all of the facts and figures, the correct outcome is obvious. The choiceless decision is a term I coined to remind myself that, at many, many decision points, aggressive fact collection and calculation will result in data that make one decision obviously superior to another. I have found that this really works. All that is usually lacking is the patience to slow down and quantify the options. Once you do, the resulting data usually reveal a direction that almost anyone would take, if presented with the same information. This process dispenses with assumptions and educated guesses and breaks down decision points to the level of making them, well, choiceless. In the case of that equipment move, I told my clients to let me think it over. Then I parked myself in a cubicle and itemized every step in the process of the equipment's use in its current location and every step in the process in the proposed new location. I drew spaghetti charts to help me visualize both options. Pretty textbook stuff, really. My analysis raised several unexpected negative side effects that would occur if the equipment was moved. The facts and figures produced information that none of us had expected. They created a choiceless decision: the equipment had to stay put. The time I put into this analysis might have seemed extravagant at first, but not when it produced the right choice with such obvious clarity. Challenge yourself and your team to approach opportunities and problem-solving less often on quick gut decisions and more often by taking the time and facts and figures that will produce choiceless decisions. That's when the results will give you no choice in your decision. Because the right one is clearly right in front of you.

"Authorities Uncover Identity of Abandoned 'Little Jane Doe'  - ABC News ABC News Video Live Shows Elections 538 Shop Log In Stream on Authorities Uncover Identity of Abandoned 'Little Jane Doe' Toddler's parents have been arrested on charges of neglect. By ABC News April 6, 2013, 1:49 PM NaN:NaN April 6, 2013&#151; -- Authorities in South Carolina have identified the toddler who was found abandoned on a stranger's doorstep with a note on her diaper that read ""Call DFAC"" or Division of Family and Child Services, and arrested her parents. After four days of investigating, the Anderson County Sheriff's Office said that the child is 4-year-old Zoe Brown of Marietta, Ga. Brown's parents -- 31-year-old Alonzo Brown and 37-year-old Tongela Denise McBride -- were arrested Friday night on charges of unlawful neglect of a child. Chad McBride, the public information office for the Anderson County Sherriff's Office, said that having the girl's story shared through social media and the news media helped lead to the discovery of the toddler's identify and the arrest of her parents. According to Chad McBride, who is not related to Denise McBride, posts on the Anderson County Sheriff's Office's Facebook page featuring Zoe Brown's picture were shared more than 2 million times. ""Just putting the story out there and all over the country, it was the media that led to the individuals that called us,"" McBride said. ""For a couple days we didn't have anything."" Zoe Brown was found on a resident's doorstep late Tuesday night in her stroller wearing a shirt adorned with the phrase ""Auntie Loves Me."" Roy Campbell, the home's owner, told the Independent Mail newspaper of Anderson that he found Zoe Brown after he heard the doorbell ring, but didn't see anyone at the door. ""I heard the neighbor's dogs barking so I went around the back of the house to see if they might have gone there,"" Campbell told the Independent Mail . ""When I didn't see anyone, I went back to the front door and noticed that there was a baby in the stroller."" After Campbell found the girl, the police were immediately called and she was taken to a local hospital where doctors determined she was in good health, authorities said. Although she is 4 years old, Zoe Brown wears clothes made for a 24-month-old and has scars on her chest and neck that are consistent with past heart surgery, McBride said. McBride said the story of the mystery ""little Jane Doe"" has galvanized the community and many people called offering to adopt the toddler. ""We've had an enormous amount of people calling -- the lead investigator, she was having a hard time focusing on the case,"" McBride said. ""They [were] so many people calling her and me [saying] 'We want to adopt a child.'"" The girl is currently in a foster home under the care of the South Carolina Department of Social Services. McBride said she will remain there until the DSS can determine whether there is a family member who can provide her with a safe environment. Under South Carolina's Daniel's Law, a caregiver will not be prosecuted if they abandon a newborn baby at any state-sanctioned ""safe haven"" such as a hospital, church or school. The law is only applicable for children under 30 days old.

Dr Prana Das, 67, needs constant care, can no longer remember his children's names and will never practice medicine again because of his head injuries. He suffered a terrifying assault at the hands of Rhiannon Gibbons, 27, and Edward Donovan, 51, who were today jailed for a total of 25 years over the robbery. Dr Das and his wife Nishebita, also a doctor, were asleep when the pair broke into their country home. Prosecutor David Elias said: 'Mrs Das was woken by a man covering her mouth with his hand, saying: ""I won't hurt you, don't shout."" 'He asked her where her husband was and in complete terror she said he was in another bedroom. A pillowcase was put over her head and her hands were tied. 'She heard the sound of her husband being attacked in his bedroom before he was brought into her room. 'The pillowcase was lifted and she could see her husband - his face was covered in blood and there was a knife held to his throat.' The mother-of-two, 64, heard her husband screaming: 'Don't beat me,' as the burglars demanded to know where their valuables were hidden. Mr Elias said: 'She heard him crying out in pain. It was clear he was being assaulted and she thought he was taking his last breaths.' Mrs Das was also forced to watch as Donovan threatened to cut her husband's throat with a knife. The two doctors were left tied to furniture at their home at Catsash, near Newport, South Wales, while Donovan and Gibbons fled in the couple's BMW. The proceeds of their 'horrific' crime was foreign currency, a mobile phone, a gold plated ornamental eagle and jewellery worth in total £100,000. Cardiff Crown Court heard Dr Das suffered bleeding to the brain and is unlikely to recover from his injuries. 'Callous disregard for Dr Das': Rhiannon Gibbons, 27, (left) and Edward Donovan, 51, (right) were jailed for 10 years and 15 years respectively after being found guilty of robbery, wounding and assault A victim impact statement by Mrs Das said her husband would never be able to practice medicine again. She said: 'He needs constant care and has become a recluse. He is nothing like the man I have lived with for many years. 'He walks with a shuffle and has limited sight. His memory has gone. 'He cannot even remember the names of his two children or his grandchildren. The children get very upset when he asks them: '""Who are you?""' 'This was a carefully planned robbery carried out with ruthlessness and no regard for the victims. You showed no remorse' Judge Eleri Rees Donovan and Gibbons were arrested after a hammer found at one of their homes was stained with the doctor's blood. CCTV cameras also caught the haul from the house being unloaded from the stolen BMW into one of the accused's flats before it was abandoned and torched. Police also seized Gibbons' mobile phone which showed that inquiries had been made about foreign currency rates and the price of gold. Donovan, and Gibbons, both from Newport, were found guilty of robbery, wounding Prana and assault. Donovan was jailed for 15 years and Gibbons for 10 years. The court heard Donovan has 29 previous court appearances for 87 offences including robbery and aggravated burglary and had recently served a five-and-a-half year sentence. Gibbons had appeared in court 12 times for 29 offences including robbery and had served terms of imprisonment. Recorder of Cardiff, Judge Eleri Rees, said: 'This was a carefully planned robbery carried out with ruthlessness and no regard for the victims. You showed no remorse. 'You showed a callous disregard for the life and health of Dr Das. 'I have no doubt the public need protection from you for a considerable length of time.' Share or comment on this article:

Photo: Mohammed Arif It was a pathetic scene in front of the district jail on Saturday. Hundreds of people along with children and elders waited for hours together to meet their relatives, who were convicted in a case of an attack on a woman at Madichetpally in Peddashankarampet mandal. As many as 67 persons of the village were sentenced to five year imprisonment on April 17 by a Sub-Court in Medak for attacking a woman, Sangamma, way back on May 31, 2009. All of them were initially shifted to the district jail located at Kandi from where they were shifted to Cherlapally jail on Saturday. Relatives wanted to meet the convicts but were not allowed to do so by the jail officials even after they waited for hours together. They even protested in front of the jail for not allowing them to meet their relatives. The jail officials stated that it was not possible as all the convicts were being shifted to Cherlapally jail as they were sentenced to more than two years imprisonment.

Latest News Wires Caught at border: Bangladesh factory owner arrested Mohammed Sohel Rana was arrested just as he was about to flee into India. So far, 377 people are confirmed to have died in the collapse of his illegally-constructed building. | Palash Khan/AP Mohammed Sohel Rana, shown to the media shortly after his capture trying to flee Bangladesh. Loading... By Chris Blake and Julhas Alam Associated Press April 28, 2013, 2:58 p.m. ET | Savar, Bangladesh The fugitive owner of an illegally-constructed building that collapsed in Bangladesh in a deadly heap last week was captured Sunday at a border crossing with India by members of a commando force. Mohammed Sohel Rana was arrested in Benapole in western Bangladesh, just as he was about to flee into India's West Bengal state, said Jahangir Kabir Nanak, junior minister for local government. Rana was brought back by helicopter to the capital Dhaka where he faced charges of negligence. Rana's capture by the Rapid Action Battalion brought cheers and applause when it was announced on a loudspeaker at the site of the collapsed building in the Dhaka suburb of Savar, where search and rescue operations were continuing through the night. At least 377 people are confirmed to have died in the collapse of the 8-story building on Wednesday. Three of its floors were built illegally. The death toll is expected to rise but it is already the deadliest tragedy to hit Bangladesh's garment industry, which is worth $20 billion annually and is a mainstay of the economy. The collapse and previous disasters in garment factories have focused attention on the poor working conditions of workers who toil for as little as $38 a month to produce clothing for top international brands. Disheveled, sweating Rana was presented before the media briefly at the commando force's headquarters in Dhaka. Wearing a printed shirt, an exhausted and disheveled Rana was sweating as two security officers held him by his arms. A security official helped him to drink water after he gestured he was thirsty. He did not speak to the media during the 10-minute appearance after which he was taken away. He is likely to be handed over to local police who will have to charge him and produce him in court within 24 hours. A small-time politician from the ruling party, Rana had been on the run since Wednesday. He last appeared in public in front of his Rana Plaza on Tuesday after huge cracks appeared in the building. However, he assured tenants, including five garment factories, that the building was safe, according to witnesses. Recommended Community Dropping the ‘senior’ in senior center: Beyond bingo, there’s speed dating and travel A bank and some shops on the first floor shut their premises on Wednesday after police ordered an evacuation, but managers of the garment factories on the upper floor told workers to continue their shifts. Hours later, Rana Plaza was reduced to rubble, crushing most victims under massive blocks of concrete and mortar. A garment manufacturers' group said the factories in the building employed 3,122 workers, but it was not clear how many were inside it when it collapsed. About 2,500 survivors have been accounted for. On Sunday, rescuers were supposed to start using heavy equipment to drill a central hole from the top to look for survivors and dead bodies. But the operation was delayed after rescuers located a woman inside the building, and were trying to pull her out. Army Maj. Gen. Chowdhury Hasan Suhrawardy, the coordinator of the rescue operations, said so far rescuers have been manually shifting concrete blocks with the help of light equipment such as pickaxes and shovels. The next phase will involve manual efforts as well as heavy equipment, including hydraulic cranes and cutters to bore a hole from the top of the collapsed building, he told reporters. Recommended On the plane with Harris – but is she really opening up to the press? The purpose is to ""continue the operation to recover both survivors and dead bodies. In this stage, we have no other choice but to use some heavy equipment. We will start it within a few hours. Manual operation and use of small equipment is not enough,"" he said. The work will be carried out carefully so as not to mutilate bodies, he said. All the equipment is in place, ""from a small blade to everything. We have engaged many private sector companies which supplied us equipment, even some heavy ones."" Woman pulled out alive In rare good news, a female worker was pulled out alive on Sunday. Hasan Akbari, a rescuer, said when he tried to extricate a man next to the woman, ""he said his body was being torn apart. So I had to let go. But God willing, we will be able to rescue him with more help very soon."" On Saturday, police arrested three owners of two factories. Also under detention are Rana's wife and two government engineers who were involved in giving approval for the building design. Local television stations reported that the Bangladesh High Court has frozen the bank accounts of the owners of all five garment factories in the collapsed building. Rana was a local leader of ruling Awami League 's youth front. His arrest, and that of the factory owners, was ordered by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina , who is also the Awami League leader. Recommended Joy With heirloom seed swaps, gardeners grow community – and biodiversity The disaster is the worst ever for the country's booming and powerful garment industry, surpassing a fire five months ago that killed 112 people and brought widespread pledges to improve worker-safety standards. But since then very little has changed in Bangladesh, where low wages have made it a magnet for numerous global brands. Bangladesh's garment industry was the third largest in the world in 2011, after China and Italy , having grown rapidly in the past decade. The country's minimum wage is the equivalent of about $38 a month. 7 million pieces a year Among the garment makers in the building were Phantom Apparels, Phantom Tac, Ether Tex, New Wave Style, and New Wave Bottoms. Altogether, they produced several million shirts, pants, and other garments a year. The New Wave companies, according to their website, make clothing for several major North American and European retailers. Britain 's Primark acknowledged it was using a factory in Rana Plaza, but many other retailers distanced themselves from the disaster, saying they were not involved with the factories at the time of the collapse or had not recently ordered garments from them.

My work in Kenya, for example, was heavily influenced by a Christian Science Monitor article I had forced myself to read 10 years earlier. Sometimes, we call things ‘boring’ simply because they lie outside the box we are currently in.” If you were to come up with a punchline to a joke about the Monitor, that would probably be it. We’re seen as being global, fair, insightful, and perhaps a bit too earnest. We’re the bran muffin of journalism. But you know what? We change lives. And I’m going to argue that we change lives precisely because we force open that too-small box that most human beings think they live in. The Monitor is a peculiar little publication that’s hard for the world to figure out. We’re run by a church, but we’re not only for church members and we’re not about converting people. We’re known as being fair even as the world becomes as polarized as at any time since the newspaper’s founding in 1908. We have a mission beyond circulation, we want to bridge divides. We’re about kicking down the door of thought everywhere and saying, “You are bigger and more capable than you realize. And we can prove it.” If you’re looking for bran muffin  journalism, you can subscribe to the Monitor for $15. You’ll get the Monitor Weekly magazine, the Monitor Daily email, and unlimited access to CSMonitor.com.
