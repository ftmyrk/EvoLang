"In 2013, Drought, falling water levels in the Tigris and the Euphrates, low water tables, overuse of water and poor maintenance of water systems are all contributing to shortages. Droughts and lack of rain in the region have a long history and have been common since the Bronze Age, where records show the lack of rainfall at the time was the cause of major crises for the Mesopotamian civilizations.
Iraq is highly dependent on the Tigris and the Euphrates, and the water from these rivers provide 99% of the freshwater in the country. The remaining 1% is from groundwater sources. It is estimated that there are about 200,000 wells in the country, of which 60,000 are active. The water is pumped from the wells and stored in the dams that were built on the Tigris and the Euphrates.

The announcement was made by the government because it was necessary for the government to disclose information about the rice. The 17,000 tons of rice are stored in a warehouse and the government had the right to decide when and how it was distributed. It was not possible for citizens to demand the rice.

Cuba: The country was not found to have any links to the kidnappings.
This is a great story that I first learned about a couple of years ago from the Huffington Post.
The story about the Hakken brothers is quite long but it is worth the read. It has a happy ending. The two boys were returned to the U.S. and the couple was arrested and charged with kidnapping and illegal flight.
I like the story because it has the following:
A couple with 3 young children flees from the U.S. with the boys
Kidnapping and illegal flight charges
U.S. and Cuban authorities work together
It's a good story of a country working together to get a job done.

"In 2013, Group Calls Upon Obama To Enact Executive Power On Environmental Issues Despite Deadlocked Congress. Center for American Progress has issued a call to President Barack Obama to require any government agency to provide a comprehensive report on the effect of proposed projects on the environment. The proposal is aimed at providing the public with more information about the projects and giving Obama more power to block environmentally harmful projects.
Environmentalists have been calling on Obama to implement such a plan for the past five years, but many argue that Obama has been reluctant to do so, especially with an election year looming.
On Thursday, CAP’s Executive Vice President for Policy & Strategy, Heather Zichal, said that such a proposal would require agencies to develop a “social cost of carbon” into their budgetary decision-making.
“It’s one of the few policy tools that can address a number of problems at once,” said Zichal. “If you’re going to build a bridge, you’re going to have to put money in the budget. What we want the administration to do is take that cost of carbon and put it into the budgetary decision-making process so that it is factored in the same way as any other cost.”
