"In 2013, Drought, falling water levels in the Tigris and the Euphrates, low water tables, overuse of water and poor maintenance of water systems are all contributing to shortages. Droughts and lack of rain in the region have a long history and have been common since the Bronze Age, where records show the lack of rainfall at the time was the cause of major crises for the Mesopotamian civilizations.
Iraq is highly dependent on the Tigris and the Euphrates, and the water from these rivers provide 99% of the freshwater in the country. The remaining 1% is from groundwater sources. It is estimated that there are about 200,000 wells in the country, of which 60,000 are active. The water is pumped from the wells and stored in the dams that were built on the Tigris and the Euphrates.
In addition, the agricultural industry relies heavily on irrigation from the Tigris and Euphrates. This makes it very vulnerable to water shortages. 80% of Iraq's food is cultivated with water, and the majority of these crops are exported. The government has been trying to improve",-666894336.0,-683671552.0,16777216.0
"In 2013, Most of the rice, 17,000 tons, was harvested in 2011 and some in 2012. The rice was grown on land contaminated by radioactivity after the Fukushima nuclear disaster. The food was processed and distributed by the government.
The Fukushima government, on March 31, 2016, announced that the 17,000 tons of rice, harvested in 2013, was not contaminated and is fit for human consumption. The announcement is not expected to cause panic, but it was also not expected to reassure those who believe that food contaminated with radiation is unsafe.
The announcement was made by the government because it was necessary for the government to disclose information about the rice. The 17,000 tons of rice are stored in a warehouse and the government had the right to decide when and how it was distributed. It was not possible for citizens to demand the rice. The government has a long tradition of deciding when and how food was distributed and this tradition continued after the Fukushima nuclear disaster.
In 2014, there were 24,000 tons of rice harvested in 2012 and 2013. The government decided to store the rice until it could make a judgment about",-662700032.0,-679477248.0,16777216.0
