Wednesday's disaster injured about 1,000 other people. Rescue crews who have been working day and night since the accident announced late Thursday that they found 40 more people alive underneath the wreckage. However, it is still unclear how many of the thousands who worked in the building remain trapped. Victims' families have gathered at the wreckage site in the suburbs of Dhaka, as well as at a nearby school where victims' bodies are being taken. Police say the factory owners appeared to have ignored a warning to not allow workers into the building after inspectors discovered cracks in it on Tuesday. Survivors say the collapse a day later happened within minutes. Authorities have filed charges and are trying to locate the owners of the building and the garment firms. More than a thousand textile workers clashed with police as they protested the accident and their country's poor industrial safety standards. In November, a fire at a separate garment factory killed more than 100 workers and triggered a public outcry. Bangladesh, one of the world's biggest clothing manufacturers, works together with major Western brands and retailers, producing inexpensive garments thanks to the South Asian nation's abundant, low-cost labor.

At the same time, he has to restore the industry's credibility, which has taken a beating following large-scale mis-selling of Ulips in the pre-crisis era. In an interview with TOI, Vijayan speaks of his priorities and how regulations are expected to stabilize. What are your priorities in your new role as IRDA chief? The insurance regulatory framework has evolved over the last decade to match the needs of the sector, whose landscape has changed post 2000 when the first set of companies were registered by IRDA. I expect the regulatory framework to stabilize to enable various stakeholders to work at further reaching out to meet the needs of the customer. I do believe that we have developed a strong foundation by aligning our regulatory structure to international best practices while, at the same time, keeping in mind the needs of our people. The industry and the regulator both need to lay down the roadmap for the medium term. Certainly, addressing mis-selling and protection of policyholders' interests is a priority. The Insurance Act Amendment Bill is set to be tabled in Parliament. How long will it take for IRDA to come out with regulations to implement these changes? The major changes that will require new regulation will be allowing reinsurance branches, regulating reinsurers who offer reinsurance to Indian market and recognizing health insurance as a separate category with different capital requirement. For life and non-life companies, there will not be any major changes in regulations. We have committees in place and once their reports are out, we will finalize the regulations. The share of insurance in savings has dropped. Some say this is because life insurance is now more for protection than for retirement savings because of changes to the Income Tax Act? Do you see this as a fundamental shift or a cyclical phenomenon? The drop is not particular to insurance since the macroeconomic factors are also at play. The positive factor, however, is that statistics show that the share of insurance funds in financial savings of households has grown, albeit marginally. This reflects the customer's faith in insurance companies and products. Certainly, there has been a shift towards traditional products which I consider to be a huge positive. Insofar as the tax laws are concerned, these would evolve to meet the needs of the growing economy and the dynamic environment in which we operate. The insurance industry will just have to keep pace with them and structure their products around meeting the needs of the policyholders and facilitating in taking the best tax advantage. Unscrupulous intermediaries have been encouraging policy holders to churn. How do you think mis-selling can be tackled? Yes, the authority and for that matter the insurance companies and the councils have all taken a host of measures to create awareness about insurance. I do believe that lack of awareness is the root cause of mis-selling and the best way of tackling it is to create awareness about the need for insurance and the various products. Against around 14 crore policies sold in a year by the insurance industry, there could be some instances where unscrupulous persons adopt malpractices for personal gains. However, wherever such instances come to the regulator's notice, they are dealt with suitably and with a firm hand. Recently, the format of the standard proposal form has been notified to draw attention to basic information as premium amount, mode of payment, policy term, premium paying term, among others. It also provides for need analysis to ensure that the product is sold based on customer need and affordability; and aims at curbing wrong advice and mis-selling. The finance minister has proposed that banks be allowed to sell policies of multiple companies. How will you ensure that banks don't push policies with highest commission? The announcement by the FM has given a greater thrust to the Bancassurance channel. Currently, the reach and potential of this channel has been minimal. The restriction on a bank to partner with only one life and one general insurer along with one specialized insurer has restricted manoeuvrability of the insurance companies to fully reach out in terms of insurance penetration. In terms of challenges, I would say that the bankers have a high regard for their customers and their needs. Customer servicing is a priority for the banker, and thus the products offered would necessarily be based on 'need-analysis'. The banking industry itself is highly competitive and the customer today is very discerning. Insofar as the commission structure is concerned, I would say it is standardized. IRDA has notified new norms for traditional products. Will this mean a complete overhaul of established products we have seen in life insurance? The new norms for traditional products do not completely overhaul the established products but are aimed at prescribing the minimum limits for certain designed parameters such as death benefit, surrender benefit, etc. The regulations aim at ensuring that the interests of stakeholders are protected while at the same time achieving consistency in terms of products offered by the insurers. As per the regulation, by October 1 all companies may have to replace some of the existing products if they are not compliant with the new norms. But in majority of the products, only minor tweaking is required. It is not like Ulips where all the products needed to be overhauled because of the regulatory limits on how much yields could be reduced. Are there any new tech initiatives IRDA is planning? IRDA, being a young regulator, has the advantage of planning and executing projects without the baggage of past legacy. The Insurance Repository and Reinsurance Exchange projects are technology-based and will harness the potential in making insurance transactions seamless and efficient. These tech-driven initiatives are one of their kind globally and are nearing fruition. The initiative to set up insurance repository is in the final stages where a central index server will be hosted to ensure coordination between the repositories. I am confident that the dream of seeing an insurance policy in electronic form will be fulfilled soon. In addition to the two on-going projects, IRDA is working on a Request for Proposal for an industry-wide fraud analytics system. The project envisages addressing issues of health insurance fraud and will also extend to all other personal lines of insurance business, including motor, life, among others.

"McCain: Assistant Secretary of Defense 'uninformed' on Al-Qaeda in Syria - UPI.com Top News U.S. News World News Featured Odd News Entertainment Movies Music TV Science Health Sports NFL MLB NBA Soccer Voices Photos News US News World News Entertainment Sports Archive Almanac Trending 'Terrifier 3' Hurricane Milton North Korea Trump-backed Bibles Fantasy football In-flight emergency Hungry raccoons Sigourney Weaver Artwork mistake Artemis moon Advertisement U.S. News April 9, 2013 / 6:23 PM McCain: Assistant Secretary of Defense 'uninformed' on Al-Qaeda in Syria By Mariam Khan - Medill News Service WASHINGTON -- Top defense officials Tuesday told a Senate counterterrorism subcommittee that al-Qaeda is the biggest national security threat to the U.S., but Sen. John McCain criticized their assessment of al-Qaeda’s influence in Syria. McCain, who arrived late to the hearing, called Assistant Secretary of Defense Derek Chollet “uninformed” for his intelligence of al-Qaeda’s hold in Islamic countries, including Syria, Iraq, Yemen and Libya. Advertisement “Answer the question,” McCain said Tuesday during the hearing, “Is al-Qaeda gaining traction and influence in Syria?” He asked the question of each of the three witnesses -- Chollet, Assistant Secretary Michael Sheehan and Adm. William McRaven, commander of the United States Special Operations Command. Sheehan eventually responded by saying al-Qaeda was “marginally” gaining traction, prompting McCain to fire back: “Marginally?” Related Confirmation hearings begin for Obama’s next budget chief McCain questions U.S. Pacific Forces commander on military sequestration Locklear: U.S. can stop N.

Prior to McCain’s outburst, Sheehan, Chollet and McRaven were providing the committee members with what their assessment of national security threats. While al-Qaeda survives mainly in the mountainous region between Afghanistan and Pakistan, “al-Qaeda and its affiliates are also evolving to exploit opportunities and fragile environments in Africa and the Middle East brought on by the unrest there over the last several years,” Sheehan said. Advertisement To successfully conquer al-Qaeda, Sheehan said, the U.S. must develop lasting relationships with capable groups in host nations so that “we can ensure agile and capable response to a range of contingencies.” Sheehan said the biggest thing the United States can do is to deny space and sanctuary to al-Qaida by making sure other nations do not succumb to the terrorist group’s pressure, saying they will continue to use “security force assistance” as a strategy to combat terrorism.
 
Security force assistance is often conducted by special operation forces, or highly trained specialists who are deployed all over the world. “We are confident that SOF will provide our national policy leaders a steady and established option to engage – consistent with our national and defense strategies – with low footprint and a focus on enabling 
our partners,” Sheehan said in a joint statement with Chollet.

USA - español News provided by Worldwide News Ukraine Apr 27, 2013, 09:53 ET Share this article Share to X Share this article Share to X KIEV, Ukraine , April 27, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- Afin de réduire les pertes économiques consécutives à la catastrophe, qui pourraient atteindre 180 milliards USD en 2015, il est important de proposer un programme de développement complet pour les régions affectées par l'explosion de la centrale nucléaire de Tchernobyl en 1986. Cette déclaration a été faite par le président de l' Ukraine , Viktor Yanukovych, lors de sa visite à la centrale de Tchernobyl à l'occasion du 27 ème anniversaire de la catastrophe nucléaire. La construction d'un nouveau confinement de sécurité constitue l'un des aspects essentiels de la conversion de la zone en un espace écologiquement sûr, a rappelé le président Yanukovych. Environ 2 700 personnes travaillent encore à la centrale nucléaire de Tchernobyl, malgré le fait que le dernier réacteur a été arrêté en l'an 2000. Le parlement ukrainien a adopté un programme de déclassement des installations comportant quatre étapes : extraction du combustible nucléaire (2010-2013), conservation des systèmes de réacteur (2013-2022), abaissement de la radioactivité des systèmes ( 2022-2045) et démantèlement de ceux-ci (2045-2065). Le 26 avril 2013, le premier ministre ukrainen Mykola Azarov a informé que les travaux sur le nouveau confinement de sécurité pour le quatrième réacteur de la centrale de Tchernobyl étaient en cours et qu'ils s'achèveraient en 2015. Le projet du Nouveau confinement de sécurité, soutenu par plus de 40 pays donateurs, est financé par l'intermédiaire du Fonds pour le sarcophage de Tchernobyl, créé en décembre 1997. Le réacteur est actuellement confiné dans son sarcophage d'origine, construit à la hâte alors que les pompiers et employés des équipes de sauvetage s'affairaient à éteindre l'incendie dans le réacteur. Plus de 400 000 m 3 de béton et 7 300 tonnes de métal ont été utilisés pour emprisonner des tonnes d'uranium, de plutonium, de corium radioactif et de poussières contaminées. Au péril de leur santé et de leur vie, 600 000 personnes ont participé aux travaux de sauvetage à Tchernobyl au cours des années qui ont suivi la catastrophe. Suite à l'explosion du quatrième réacteur de la centrale nucléaire de Tchernobyl, située à 100 kilomètres au nord de la capitale ukrainienne Kiev , des substances radioactives ont contaminé une zone de 145 000 kilomètres carrés, incluant des territoires en Ukraine , au Bélarus et en Russie. Près de 5 millions de personnes ont été affectées par la catastrophe. Une zone d'un rayon de 30 kilomètres autour de la centrale reste officiellement inhabitée.

"Treehouse Lands $7M From Kaplan, Social+Capital To Help You Learn To Code | TechCrunch Treehouse Lands $7M From Kaplan, Social+Capital To Help You Learn To Code | TechCrunch TechCrunch Desktop Logo TechCrunch Mobile Logo Latest Startups Venture Apple Security AI Apps Events Podcasts Newsletters Sign In Search Submit Site Search Toggle Mega Menu Toggle Topics Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture More from TechCrunch Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Sign In Treehouse Lands $7M From Kaplan, Social+Capital To Help You Learn To Code Rip Empson 9:21 AM PDT · April 9, 2013 Educational platform Treehouse is announcing today that it has raised $7 million in Series B financing from Kaplan Ventures, with participation from its existing investor, The Social+Capital Partnership. The round follows the $600K in seed financing it raised in October 2011 from Kevin Rose, Reid Hoffman, David Sze and Mark Suster, among others, which was followed by its $4.75 million Series A in April of last year. Treehouse has raised more than $12 million to date. Treehouse launched in late 2011 on an ambitious mission: To help anyone learn to code and design for iOS, Android and the web, regardless of their technical know-how. By combining the video-based approach of Lynda.com and learn-to-code platforms like Codecademy, Treehouse aimed to create an educational platform that leverages video, quizzes, a splash of gamification and project-based learning to help aspiring app developers and engineers learn the trade. By charging students between $29 and $49 for access to its library of video content, realtime practice engine, in-depth interviews with experts and workshops, Treehouse was quick to reach profitability, and by September, more than 12,000 people (ages 7 to 50) were paying for its platform. Since then, its user base has grown to more than 25,000 active students. In conjunction with its new capital, the startup is also announcing today that it is in the process of launching its first high school pilot program, which aims to train high school seniors to be job-ready for engineering positions without needing a university degree. The program will run for six months and cost $9/month, per student. Treehouse’s move into high school follows on the heels of its “College Scholarship Program,” announced last fall, in which it offered 5,000 “Gold” accounts to college students in the U.S. for free — for a full two years. Because Gold plans typically run $50/month, this worked out to $3 million worth of free Treehouse education — the equivalent of what students would have had to pay out of pocket. Treehouse Founder and CEO Ryan Carson told us at the time its motivation was, essentially, a response to the absurd cost of higher education — a cost that is expected to continue rising. To combat this unsustainable cost, Treehouse set out to offer students of all ages a comparable quality of education, without those costly student loans. The startup’s push to reach both high school and college students is part of its effort to prove that a university degree isn’t in fact required for success in the job market; instead, the founder believes that smart, interactive online education can be just as effective. But, in an increasingly crowded world of video-based education and learn-to-code platforms, good intentions alone can’t propel a startup to long-term success. Carson says that he thinks Treehouse will be able to differentiate itself from the competition over the long-term by focusing on cultivating a full-time teaching staff made up of experienced professionals — rather than relying on crowdsourced content to drive its lessons. That, and privileging project-based learning through live coding in the browser and a “learn by doing” approach to technical education, he hopes will be able to give it a leg up over veteran players like Lynda.com. As to why his firm elected to invest in the education startup for a second time, Chamath Palihapitiya said: Treehouse is already the biggest computer science school in the world and has the potential to be one of the most important … They’re creating an education model that massively reduces debt, increases job readiness and drives value in today’s economy. This is exactly what America needs right now.

He’s worked as a senior associate at Morgenthaler Ventures and Canvas Venture Fund, and before venture capitalizing, Rip spent nearly four years at TechCrunch, the leading technology publication and media dynamo, where he covered startups. Within the Whacky World Of Startups, Rip focused most of his attention on chronicling the rise of technology and ambush of innovation on health and education. But between you and me, I hear he’s especially passionate about any and all forms of disrupting — particularly those that are disrupting the disruptable disruptions — and anyone or anything that can quench his insatiable thirst for disrupt-a-lutions. Rip has been quoted by various people at various times – some of them publications and probably super wicked famous people referencing his work – some of them people mistakenly re-tweeting him thinking he’s Rip Torn. Is he a budding national treasure? You said it, not him. As to what he’s doing right now? He’s either transferring his life savings from Scramble With Friends tokens to Bitcoin or vice versa.

It’s believed the gang drained a substantial amount of fuel from the tank. Four staddle stone tops were also stolen from the property. The value of the stolen property is not known as yet, say police. Inspector Jackie Willson, from Romsey Police, advised people to fit security devices to all oil tanks. “They should fit a float on their oil tanks. It has a sensor alarm and will detect if levels in the tank fall rapidly,” said Inspector Willson. She also warned the public to report any suspicious activity immediately. Thousands of pounds worth of domestic fuel oil has been stolen in the Test Valley since the beginning of the year.

On April 23, Parliamentâs standing committee on coal and steel submitted its report on allotment of coal and lignite blocks. Assailing the policy of subjectively awarding coal blocks to end-users such as power and steel companies, the committee pointed out production had begun in only 30 of 195 coal blocks allocated between 1993 and 2008. A vast majority of these coal blocks â 160 â were allocated by the UPA government between 2004 and 2008. Production has begun in only two. The committee called for cancellation of ânon-seriousâ allotments. The principle of giving captive coal blocks only to genuine end-users had been grossly violated, it said, citing some pretty damning examples. In one case a company given a coal block to use for its steel plant was found to have no steel plant. Thirteen years after getting access to the coal block, it was still trying to buy a steel facility. Following the mass cancellation of similarly dubious 2G telecom licences by the Supreme Court in 2012, it is feasible the UPA government will use the guillotine for coal allocations as well. Blocks where production has not begun will be taken back, perhaps after court prodding, and the standing committee report will be invoked to neutralise the coal scandal. Nevertheless this will not solve the entirety of Indiaâs coal mess. Why does a country with the fifth-largest reserves in the world â 286 billion tonnes of coal and 41 million tonnes of lignite â face chronic coal shortages? Even the 195 coal blocks allotted over the past 20 years have geological reserves of 44 billion tonnes. Those figures stand out when one considers the world consumes no more than seven billion tonnes of coal a year. In 2013-14, India will consume 770 million tonnes. Just over 600 million tonnes will be produced domestically and 165 million tonnes will be imported. Overseas sellers, importers and contractors are no doubt salivating but given the coal reserves this country has, why are such massive purchases from abroad needed at all? Coal is among Indiaâs most crucial but also dirtiest industries. It is responsible for some 70% of the power generated in India, a figure that will fall only marginally in the coming years. Between 1971 and 1973 much of the coal business in India was nationalised, and a giant and inefficient monopoly called Coal India was created. Public-sector sluggishness, along with criminal and political syndicates in mining centres such as Dhanbad, gave coal a negative reputation. Just how crazy the coal business is in India should be apparent from a late-1990s story. A study commissioned by Coal India found the brick industry used 22 million tonnes of coal but was buying only two million tonnes directly from Coal India. It became clear there was an extensive black market in operation. This study was used to win Coal India permission to sell 10% of its output through e-auctions. E-auctions began to fetch a price for coal that was 70% more than the notified price. About 20 years ago, there was a proposal to break Coal Indiaâs stranglehold, allot coal blocks to genuine end-users and free them from the public-sector monolithâs unpredictable supply chains. It was a moment for Indian enterprise to display its quest for excellence. Instead, the rush for coal blocks showed Indian capitalism at its most sordid. Far from bringing in new technology and expeditiously excavating coal, the majority of the companies allotted coal blocks sought to sit tight. Rather than use the coal in associated power plants â or even attempt to set these up â many of the companies began to see themselves as traders and arbitrage earners, waiting to sell out. Since they had been given a block to use coal for their own needs and not sell in the open market, hectic lobbying began with the Union government to âliberaliseâ the coal sector. What this meant was: forget end-use; let us sell coal to whoever wants it. Three years ago, at the height of the coal boom, it was estimated if they were allowed to simply pull out the coal and sell it, such supposedly âend-userâ companies would make profits of between 800-8,000%. If the private sector has disgraced itself, should one turn to the public sector as an exemplar of integrity? Far from this, Coal India is a byword for leakage, corruption and environmental degradation. It sets the trend in preferring surface-level open-cast mining and ignoring ecologically-friendlier technologies. After coal miners have extracted the mineral, they leave behind a sooty, arid wasteland. The power capacity enhancement target for the 12th Five-Year Plan (2012-17) is 100,000 MW. Coal blocks already cleared by the environment ministry can produce coal for 200,000 MW. Yet mining companies, including Coal India, simply want a greater number of blocks, as if they were building land banks. Citing high costs, they refuse to invest in better technology, go deeper and exploit the current blocks optimally. Where does the coal conundrum end then? Between a compromised government-owned monopoly, buccaneer businessmen and crony-friendly politicians, is there a way out? While we navigate that route, we can at least take back coal blocks and resources that belong to India â and not to a cartel of rent seekers. The writer is a political commentator.

The measures are aimed at reining in armed militias that frequently arrest and sometimes torture citizens. The laws say anyone complicit in such crimes also will be punished. They specifically mention politicians, bureaucrats, police and the military. Prime Minister Ali Zidan's office said his chief of staff was freed Monday, a week after he was kidnapped. No other details were given. The new Libyan government is struggling to assert its authority over militias, less the two years after the popular uprising that toppled long-time dictator Moammar Gadhafi.

Her imprisonment has strained the former Soviet state's ties with the European Union and the United States. https://p.dw.com/p/18POh Image: picture-alliance/dpa Advertisement The court ruled unanimously that Ukraine had violated sections of the European Convention on Human Rights relating to liberty and security, speedy review of the lawfulness of detention, right to compensation for unlawful detention, and a limitation on restricting rights. A majority also ruled that Ukraine had not violated a prohibition on inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment as Tymoshenko had alleged. ""The court held in particular: that Ms. Tymoshenko's pretrial detention had been arbitrary; that the lawfulness of her detention had not been properly reviewed; and that she had no possibility to seek compensation for her unlawful deprivation of liberty,"" according to a press release. ""The court also found that, given that the judge had referred to her alleged hindering of the proceedings and contemptious behavior, her right to liberty had been restricted for other reasons than those permissible under Article 5."" The court stressed in its ruling that Tuesday's verdict was not final. Under articles 43 and 44 of the ECHR convention, any such lower chamber ruling can be appealed - by either side - at the Grand Chamber of the ECHR in Strasbourg. Tymoshenko had accused Ukraine's government of rigging the case against her and holding her in inhumane conditions. Lawyers for the state had called the allegations groundless. In 2011, a court in Ukraine sentenced Tymoshenko, an architect of the 2004 pro-democracy Orange Revolution, to seven years in prison after convicting her of exceeding her powers as prime minster while negotiating a gas contract with Russia. Tymoshenko twice served as prime minister of Ukraine, both times in an uneasy alliance with political rival President Viktor Yanukovich, most recently from December 2007 to March 2010. mkg/msh (AP, dpa) Send us your feedback Your feedback Advertisement Skip next section Explore more Explore more Lutsenko: Ukraine needs the EU association deal Lutsenko: Ukraine needs the EU association deal Yuri Lutsenko, the former Ukrainian interior minister under the then Yulia Tymoshenko government, spent two years in prison for abuse of powers.

Ellen J. Horrow, USA TODAY Sports Patrick still upset with fellow driver David Gilliland %22He was just driving in a way that I didn%27t think was appropriate%2C%22 Patrick says. Patrick looking for a strong showing at Richmond this week RICHMOND, Va. — Danica Patrick is still aggravated by David Gilliland's driving style and she's not shy about admitting it. One week after venting about Gilliland's driving on her team radio during the STP 400 at Kansas Speedway, Patrick hasn't abandoned her assertion that Gilliland doesn't race her the way he races against everyone else. ""I watched him move over and let someone by, so no, I don't think he does and that's what makes me mad,"" Patrick said Friday at Richmond International Raceway. ""I think he's getting more attention for this than he deserves."" But Gilliland doesn't expect any retaliation on track Saturday night. Gilliland said they discussed their issues before practice Friday consider the matter closed. ""I talked to her a little bit this morning and we're all good,"" Gilliland said. ""I feel like it's maybe just a respect thing between the two of us, and we talked about it and feel like we're on track to race each other the way we need to."" Patrick could be heard on her team radio Sunday complaining about how Gilliland tries to take her out all the time. She asked her team to deliver a message: ""Tell his spotter that I'm coming after him if he does it again."" Gilliland gave a four-word response to Patrick through a team spokesman after the Kansas race: "" Shut up and race ."" Patrick was particularly annoyed by how aggressively Gilliland raced her last Sunday, but the flare-up in Kansas wasn't the first time that Gilliland has left Patrick feeling frustrated. ""I've felt like he drives very aggressively against me from Darlington last year on,"" she said. ""It was just a lot more of it last weekend. … He was just driving in a way that I didn't think was appropriate, and I haven't thought it was appropriate for a long time."" Patrick will be racing a Sprint Cup car at Richmond for the first time Saturday night, but she hopes to parlay her success from two weeks ago at Martinsville Speedway — NASCAR's shortest track at .526 miles — to the .75-mile track at Richmond. ""I've always enjoyed coming to Richmond,"" Patrick said. ""I've enjoyed racing IndyCars here and I liked driving the Nationwide car, even though we haven't had the greatest results. There seems to be some similarities between Martinsville and here, so we're hoping that translates."" Patrick finished 12th at Martinsville, her second-best finish of the year after a career-best eighth in the Daytona 500. Follow Ellen J.

Matters YOU US TNS Islamabad Serena lit up green and white By Our Correspondent August 09, 2018 Islamabad : All Serena hotels in the country have been lit up green and white as part of the Independence Day celebrations. Besides exterior lighting, the Serena hotels have also put up photo walls in the lobby until August 14 displaying the images of the journey to independence, said organisers. They said photographers from across the country are contributing to the ongoing photography contest ‘Discover Pakistan’ whose winners will be announced on August 14. The organisers said the photographs depicted the many varied faces of Pakistan and the immense diversity of terrain, heritage and culture the country was blessed with. They said the celebrations would end in a flag hoisting ceremony at each hotel, while the winners of the Serena Sarangi Star Competition, Ans Rehmani and Yoon Band would perform in Islamabad and Swat Serena hotels respectively on August 14.

An excerpt addresses the dangerous phenomenon of xenophobia and neo-Nazism in the country today. 26.04.2013, 16.30 Uhr Zur Merkliste hinzufügen X.com Facebook E-Mail Link kopieren Weitere Optionen zum Teilen X.com Facebook E-Mail Messenger WhatsApp Link kopieren Bild vergrößern When a South African man is brutally beaten by neo-Nazis, no one helps. Foto: Patrick Pleul/ dpa Dieser Beitrag stammt aus dem SPIEGEL-Archiv. Warum ist das wichtig? In the opening chapter of ""The Jewish Candidate,"" Frank Carver, a reporter for the fictitious London Chronicle , is posted to Germany to cover the country's most-fascinating election campaign since World War II. Rudolf Gutman, the first Jew to run for chancellor, is promising to free Germany from the shackles of its past. But Gutman is in danger. Neo-Nazis secretly guided by Hermann von Tietjen, the brilliant, crazed leader of the popular Free National Party, plot to assassinate the candidate, using cash and contacts of old SS men to hire a killer. Alerted by a tip-off, Carver and local freelancer Wolfang Renner race to clinch the scoop of their lives, while Tietjen covers his tracks with a devilish gambit that plunges the nation into terror. As the clock ticks down to election day and the noose tightens around Gutman's neck, their quest turns into a lone, bloody struggle for survival that brings them face to face with modern Germany's dark secret. Will they unmask the assassin in time? What follows here is a chilling excerpt from ""The Jewish Candidate,"" published this month by London's Peach Publishing and available for purchase as an e-book on Amazon websites in the United States , Britain and other countries. Although a work of fiction, the issues explored in the tome couldn't be more contemporary given next month's opening of a massive trial of the murderous National Socialist Underground terror cell. The case is already the subject of intense international media coverage, and it is likely to raise troubling questions abroad about xenophobia that still persists in Germany seven decades after the war and almost 23 years after reunification. Berlin , Saturday, August 4 David Khosa gazed out of the train window as it rolled through the northern suburbs of Berlin towards the Baltic Coast. After almost a year of hard studying at the Technical University, he was looking forward to his first weekend out of the city since he arrived from Cape Town. Only three more months left to complete his postgraduate course in electrical engineering and he would be able to return home to pick a well-paid job and marry his fiancee Mbhali, the most beautiful woman in southern Africa. That description always irritated her because it implied there may be an even more beautiful woman in northern, western or eastern Africa, or on another continent. Thinking of her always made him smile. He looked around and saw a young blonde woman sitting across the aisle staring at him. He nodded and said ""Guten Tag."" She frowned and turned away with a hint of disgust on her pretty face. As if she had caught a whiff of dog shit. Three more months. When he first came to Berlin he had been so excited, despite the separation from his love. Berlin was such a positive symbol for the world. No more divisions. The fall of the Wall coincided with the end of Apartheid. Everything about it fascinated him, from the Red Army soldiers' rude graffiti on the interior of the Reichstag parliament building to the brilliantly refurbished grand museums, the grand old boulevards, the hidden remnants of the Wall, the Holocaust memorial. But it only took a few weeks for the fascination to pass. Why did people here look so miserable? What did they have to be sad about? They were rich, everything worked, their lives were incredibly easy. The cool reception he got from many ordinary Berliners as soon as he left campus reminded him of the bad days back home. The way some people on the street and in shops looked at him made him feel uncomfortable. That indignant look as if he had done something wrong, or was about to. The first time he went to a public library, he noticed that one of the staff followed him down the aisle and watched him from a few meters away. As if he was going to slip a book into his bag. Or make a bonfire of Goethe's works and dance around it chanting. He had worked hard to polish his German and knew it well enough to realize that strangers were addressing him with the informal "" Du "" rather than the formal "" Sie "" they reserved for fellow Germans. It was a little thing but it irked him, and he wondered if the whole of Europe was like this. Even before he left Cape Town he had been warned about attacks on foreigners in eastern Germany. But he was 28 and knew how to look after himself. And he was determined to make the most of his time here. He shut his eyes and thought of the sandy beaches back home. His tutor Bernd had told him he must visit the Baltic island of Rügen before he returned to Cape Town. ""Great beaches. You'll feel at home, David."" He was looking forward to renting a ""beach basket,"" a covered wicker bench unique to German beaches, and watching the sunset. The train was a cherry picker. It stopped at deserted, run-down little towns. At Eberswalde, three skinheads got on the train, cackling loudly and carrying a crate of beer. As they moved down the aisle, one of them spotted David, pointed and shouted ""Look, a Negro! From Hottentottenland!"" The three skinheads sat down next to the blonde girl and watched David. Two of them looked like twins. They had expressionless blue eyes. Doc Martens boots, military-style trousers and bomber jackets. Their eyebrows were almost white. The third man was obese, with a flabby gut spilling over his jeans. He wore a black T-shirt with some Gothic writing. He stank of sweat. As David looked around, he noticed that the relaxed chatter from the handful of other passengers in the carriage had stopped and given way to an expectant, nervous silence. The fat youth leaned over and gawped at him. ""Eh you,"" he snarled in English. ""You fucking Neger. You go home to Hottentottenland!"" The two others started making ape noises and sniggering. They clinked their bottles. David looked at him, shook his head and turned away. He couldn't believe what he was hearing. The man raised his voice, feigning offence. ""Hey, fucking Affe I talking you! You hear me? I talking you! This is Germany. We want no Nigger here. This is a clean country. Hey Neger , Nigger, I talking you!"" He was shouting now. David could smell the beer on his breath. He knew he should move to another carriage but the rage welling in his gut wouldn't let him. He didn't want to give them the satisfaction. No one in the carriage spoke out. Paralyzed by Horror A family of four gathered up their beach gear and quietly moved down the train, beyond the sliding doors. A middle-aged man folded up his paper and also left. The blonde stood up and followed him, not looking at David as she pushed past the skinheads. Her departure silenced them for a couple of minutes and they spoke in German, too fast for him to understand. The train stopped at yet another little town and to David's horror, there were dozens more skinheads on the platform waiting to get on. They carried furled banners and red, white and black flags. There was no sign of any police. The train moved off. The carriage was now crowded with neo-Nazis. One, a man in his mid-20s sporting a Hitler Youth-style haircut with a severe parting and what looked like a World War Two army jacket, sat down next to him as heavily as he could manage, squeezing him against the window. Two others were sitting opposite him now. The driver announced the next stop was just two minutes away. David decided it was time to move to another carriage. He stood up to get his bag, but a hand grabbed his arm and pulled him down. ""Hey, Neger, have a drink with us!"" the fat one croaked, standing up. He had shaken his bottle of beer, pointed it at David and sprayed it in his face. ""Good German beer, ja! You like?"" The whole carriage erupted into wild laughter. David looked up and saw the emergency break. But the train was already slowing as it entered Wenzlau station. He lunged at the fat one and managed to strike his nose, but not with enough force. A terrific, painful blow smashed into the side of his head. Someone had struck him with a bottle of beer. He felt the cold liquid running down his neck, and the wet warmth of blood. He felt dizzy. He tried to haul himself down the corridor but was tripped up and found himself lying face down on the carriage floor. Fists and boots slammed into his back. A boot stamped on the back of his head. The shouts were deafening. He was alone in a hell of hatred. Someone leant close to his eye and spat: ""You're dead you fucking pig nigger."" A second later, a sharp, powerful kick jabbed his right kidney. He shrieked with pain. He was suddenly terrified he would sustain lasting damage. Screaming for help, he got on all fours and scrambled for the exit. Someone kicked his backside and caught his testicles. The blow sent him crashing into the sliding doors. They whooshed open. The ticket inspector was standing over him. The crowd of skinheads fell silent. The inspector looked down at him. ""What's going on here?"" David pulled himself to his feet, almost buckling under a piercing pain from his kidney. Blood was trickling down his face. ""Helfen Sie mir bitte,"" he said. Help me please. The inspector looked at him with disgust and stepped back. David pushed past him and hurled himself towards the opened train door. Someone tripped him again and he tumbled down the steps, knocking his head on the concrete of the platform. He hauled himself up and limped along beside the train, aware of people staring at him. He turned round to see the group of skinheads following him. He turned the corner and staggered up a cobblestoned street. The pounding boots were catching up. He could hear them baying ""Negerschwein!"" People were coming out of shops to see what was happening. "" Hilfe !"" he pleaded, but no one did anything. Beer bottles exploded next to him. There was a red brick church about 100 yards ahead up the street. But he knew he wouldn't make it. He stopped in the middle of the street and looked around. Above him, people had opened their windows and were leaning out with their arms folded on the sills, as if they were waiting for some festival parade. Shopkeepers, children, women clutching plastic shopping bags watched him in silence. The mob had almost reached him. The air was filled with a low hum of ape noises. He could hear a loudspeaker in the background. He looked up and saw black balloons rising into the sky. This must be the town they were all heading to for their rally. But the realization had no impact on him. He was too paralyzed by horror, and by the prospect that he might not see his Mbhali again. There was blood and sweat in his eyes and everything went blurry. ""Hilf mir bitte. Help me!"" Somewhere in the distance, too far away, he could hear a siren. He spotted a butcher's shop. The owner was standing in the doorway. David ran towards him. But the man stepped inside and slammed the glass door shut. Before he could stop, David tripped over a loose paving stone and went smashing through the door. Glass shattered all around him. He lay on his back on the floor of the shop. He could feel a warm rush around his neck and started to feel weak. At least the pain had gone. The delicious smell of fried sausage and roast meat filled his nostrils. He turned his head and saw a pool of blood spreading over the immaculate black-and-white tiled floor. The sight made him convulse with a surge of panic. His vision started to go black. He started to shiver. He could hear voices and saw the outline of figures staring at him through the shattered door. Someone laughed. Then heavy boots running off. The most beautiful woman in southern Africa was so far away. Tears filled his eyes. He tried to picture her but his mind was so filled with terror that she wouldn't come. All he could see was the white sand of Llandudno Beach in Cape Town where he had proposed to her. The most beautiful and kind woman in the whole world. The mother of his unborn children. He tried to say her name but it never came. On board the SPD campaign bus, Sunday, August 5 Rudolf Gutman read the news of Khosa's death on his laptop, en route to a campaign speech in Dortmund. His campaign manager, Bruno Heise, alerted him to the story. Four skinheads were briefly detained after Khosa's death, but they were unlikely to face any charges. They had a dozen witnesses - their mates and one elderly male passenger - to testify that Khosa struck the first blow. Besides, Khosa died because he tripped and severed his jugular when he fell through the glass door. A tragic accident, as the mayor of Wenzlau pointed out. No one else who was in the carriage, on the train platform or in Wenzlau's high street came forward to testify. The butcher said he closed the door because ""the man looked like a wild animal and appeared to be deranged."" Gutman slapped the table. ""Jesus Christ! What the hell is going on? A baying mob of Nazis hounding a black man to his death! And no one lifting a finger to help him! Jesus!"" Heise nodded. ""These Nazi bastards have killed almost 200 people since 1990!"" said Gutman. ""In some parts of the east, they're in charge of local councils, they're even running bloody kindergartens. Can you believe it? They hold village fetes, put up bouncy castles! The kids grow up learning to hate Jews and Muslims before they even know what Jews and Muslims are! Just wait, Bruno. If I get in they won't know what's hit them. I'll clean that scum up. You mark my words."" ""Careful, Rudi,"" Heise warned. ""Voters won't elect a Jewish guy who just wants to go round chasing Nazis. They want to hear that their jobs and pensions are safe under a Gutman government. If you don't get that message across you'll be sitting on the wrong side of the Reichstag after election day."" Gutman sighed. Heise was right. As usual. The former tabloid newspaper editor knew what made the average German tick. ""You can't go on too much about neo-Nazis because most voters don't see them as a threat,"" said Heise. ""They just see them as irrelevant whackos. To do anything about them, you've got to be in power. And this is your one and only shot at the job.""

Home South Caucasus Georgia PM: Presence of separatist regions impedes Georgia’s NATO accession Georgia Materials 29 April 2013 13:50 (UTC +04:00) Follow Trend on Whatsapp Telegram Facebook Twitter News Georgia, Tbilisi, April 29 / Trend, N.Kirtskhalia / The presence of separatist regions impedes Georgia's accession into NATO, Georgian Prime Minister Bidzina Ivanishvili believes. He made this statement to journalists in Tbilisi before the opening of the 83rd Rose Roth Seminar with the support of the NATO Parliamentary Assembly ""This seminar is being held in Georgia for the fourth time. Georgia has done a lot in this direction. We are absolutely ready to join NATO, although certain processes prevent it. I think because of our activity we can overcome this obstacle by becoming member of the Alliance,"" Ivanishvili said. The 83rd Rose Roth Seminar entitled 'South Caucasus: geopolitical developments, the Euro-Atlantic integration and domestic challenges' kicked off today in Tbilisi with the organisational support of the NATO Parliamentary Assembly. The seminar will discuss Georgian-Russian relations, the integration of the South Caucasus countries into the Euro-Atlantic structures, a programme of reforms planned in Georgia and regional issues. The seminar will end on May 1. Large scale military action was launched in South Ossetia in Georgia on August 8, 2008. Later, Russian troops occupied Tskhinvali and expelled the Georgian military. Russia recognised the independence of South Ossetia and Abkhazia in late August. Tbilisi ended diplomatic relations with Moscow in response and has declared the two unrecognised republics of Abkhazia and South Ossetia occupied territories.

"Soldier given six hours to pay maintenance fine

Manchester Sand appeared in court yesterday for judgment and sentence.  Sand defaulted in paying maintenance for eight months in 2008 and was found guilty on eight counts of failure to comply with a court order.  In passing his sentence chief magistrate Mokwadi Gabanagae said that he could only suspend the sentence on one condition.  ""Your sentence is as follows; six months in prison for each count. I can only suspend the sentence if the accused pays the arrears by 4:30 today. If you do not pay the P4000 today I will release a warrant for your imprisonment,"" he said. The accused who left the courtroom in a hurry did not seem to believe his ears as he asked for clarification.  In reading his judgment Gabanagae said that it was clear that the accused person did not pay the money even though he wanted to claim that he did.  ""Common cause is that on May 26, 2002 the accused person was ordered by the Francistown magistrate court to pay a fee of P250 for each of his children as maintenance until they turned 18 or were self-supportive and the accused person failed to do so,"" said the magistrate.

The bail was dismissed on the grounds that Musharraf's counsel did not pursue the case on bail plea. Federal Investigation Agency (FIA)'s Prosecutor Chaudhry Zulfiqar said that following the cancellation of his bail petition, Musharraf could be arrested any time now. The bench had resumed the hearing over a petition filed by Musharraf seeking bail in the case pertaining to the murder of former two-time prime minister Benazir Bhutto in December 2007. The bench had earlier given the counsel for the petitioner an hour's time to makes make its argument over why the former military should be granted bail. Musharraf's counsel instead of giving his argument, had sought more time and requested the court to adjourn the hearing. Prosecuting lawyer of the FIA had objected to the request arguing that Musharraf was already under detention on judicial remand at his Chak Shehzad residence, which was declares as a sub-jail after the cancellation of his bail in the judges detention case.

SALT LAKE CITY — The fiancee of a 19-year-old man shot and killed outside a Salt Lake convenience store has been arrested for investigation of obstruction of justice. Sione Fakatoufifita , 19, of West Valley City, was shot and killed outside a Maverik convenience store, 1680 S. Redwood Road , on April 13. He had just called his parents to ask for a ride home when he was shot. It was still unclear Monday why Fakatoufifita, who lives in West Valley City, was in Salt Lake City at 1 a.m. Witnesses told police that they saw a man running across the parking lot after the shooting and nearly get hit by a car as he tried to get across Redwood Road. Fakatoufifita's fiancee was arrested April 16 for investigation of obstruction of justice. Morgan Maree Janet Holst, 18, remained in jail Monday on $250,000 bail. Holst, the last person to see Fakatoufifita alive, was interviewed several times by police following his death. During those interviews she ""lied several times to detectives about the details of her involvement"" with Fakatoufifita, according to a Salt Lake County Jail report. During her last interview with police, officers read her Miranda rights, which she waived, and then ""continued to lie"" to investigators during the interview, the report states, ""and admitted she had lied several times in previous interviews."" A possible motive for the shooting was not known Saturday. Anyone with information can call police at 801-799-3000.

Then, she walked another 1,004 miles along the shorelines of all five Great Lakes. What does Battle Creek's Loreen Niewenhuis have inside her that compels her to put one foot in front of the other? ""I'd rather do 20 miles on soft sand than 10 miles on the side of the road,"" she says. ""There is something about being where water meets land. I feel very clicked-in there. I feel like I can go forever."" Maybe she has walked more than 2,000 miles in the last four years because she seeks God. Or fears death. Or is on a crazy exercise regimen. Or on the lam from the FBI. She laughs heartily. No to all of the above. She's actually more like Forrest Gump, who one day just put on his shoes and decided to set off on a little run. ""Our older son had gone off to college. The nest was emptying. I'd gotten my"" master of fine arts degree. ... ""But I felt I could stack up novels and not have an agent and be in my office writing novels forever,"" says Niewenhuis, 49. ""So I thought, let me do something completely different and get out of my office."" So she put on her hiking boots. She got out the office. Boy, did she ever. 'It really stacks up' Niewenhuis lives in a pleasant condo on Goguac Lake near downtown Battle Creek. The divorced mother of two sons, 20 and 23, grew up in Plymouth and South Lyon and trained as a research scientist in biology. In recent years, she's been a novelist and short-story writer. In her loft is her hiking gear (one pair of Keen boots has more than 700 miles on them). Nearby is a writing desk with a panoramic view of the water. Her first trek in 2009, started at Navy Pier in Chicago and went around Lake Michigan counterclockwise. It was a shock. Beaches gave way to jetties, impassable barriers, busy roads. She saw trash. She sank in bogs. Walked around nuclear power plants. In rain, wind, cold, sun, heat, she kept walking. And walking. And walking. She saw river otters. Zebra mussels. Stunning scenery. She won't say how much the first trip cost, but it was ""thousands"" of dollars, she says. She also tried not to think of the whole 1,000 miles she was walking. ""You put in a day, and it's 15 miles, but day after day, it really stacks up."" She stayed in hotels or B&Bs near cities, and her one-person hammock tent in campgrounds and on remote beaches. Some food she packed in her 35-pound backpack, cooking meals with a camp stove. The trek took 64 days. When she finished, she wrote a book, ""A 1,000-mile Walk on the Beach"" (Crickhollow, $16.95), which earned her enough money to pay for her second trek last year. This time, she hiked Michigan's entire sunrise (Lake Huron and Lake St. Clair) coast in the Lower Peninsula, plus portions of the Upper Peninsula (Pictured Rocks, the Keweenaw); Lake Michigan (Sleeping Bear and the Leelanau), western Lake Erie (Port Clinton, Ohio, to Grosse Isle); and the northern shore of Lake Ontario from Toronto to Belleville, Ontario. She ended her trip with a big splash -- at Niagara Falls. Niewenhuis' second book comes out June 1, ""A 1,000-Mile Great Lakes Walk"" (Crickhollow, $16.95). With the proceeds, she hopes to finance a third trek she's already planning -- walking 1,000 miles on Michigan's islands. Alone with thoughts You probably didn't notice a lone woman in her 40s walking from Downriver to Detroit last year on Easter Sunday, but that was Niewenhuis. Because she couldn't walk directly on the shore of the Detroit River past the smokestacks and factories, she walked on Biddle and Jefferson, a woman with a 35-pound backpack and a walking stick. The only person she saw was a homeless man, who stared. Then he shouted out, ""Happy Easter!"" She hiked 80% to 90% of her treks alone. She never listened to an iPod. She just listened to nature and her own thoughts. Sometimes, she sensed more. ""I'm not a real spiritual person, so this wasn't a connection with God sort of thing, but something that happened on the first hike,"" she says. ""The exertion of hiking fell away, and it felt like the Earth was turning beneath me, like it was completely effortless, and I was completely alive in the moment."" Niewenhuis talks little about problems on her hikes. She doesn't recall anything too difficult or lonely. She remembers enjoying herself. Talk to family members who accompanied her on short stretches of the trips, however, and they have a slightly different memory. ""If that first day we walked together from Mears to Pentwater had been the first day of my 1,000 mile trek, I would have gone home and found an easier project to undertake,"" remembers Leslie Shipley of Brighton, Niewenhuis' sister, recalling wind, rain, wading streams with garbage bags over her boots and wandering through thick brush as she accompanied her sister for two days of hiking. Niewenhuis' son Lucas, 20, a student at the University of Michigan, hiked most of a 50-mile stretch of Lake Michigan with his mom. ""Something like 40-mile-per-hour wind gusts sandblasted us and the lake raged all the way up to the dunes,"" he says. Still, he did not worry about his mother. ""I knew she wasn't going to get lost, give up or do anything too dangerous. Most of what I know about safety, caring and having an independent spirit came from her."" Great Lakes, up close Niewenhuis has felt a kinship to the Great Lakes since childhood trips to Warren Dunes State Park near Benton Harbor. Yet what she saw last year while walking the shorelines is a different picture than a shore walker would have had in her childhood or a decade ago. It's a critical time. The beloved Great Lakes are suffering. They hold 20% of the world's fresh water. Forty million people rely on them for drinking water. Yet lakes Michigan and Huron are at their lowest levels ever recorded, falling another 18 inches between June and December of 2012 alone. Toxins, pharmaceuticals and invasive species have attacked the lakes. Firsthand and up close, Niewenhuis saw the condition of Saginaw Bay, where phragmites clog the beaches, and western Lake Erie, with its toxic blue-green algae sheen. She drank water out of all the Great Lakes using her filtered water bottle — all the lakes except Erie. Niewenhuis met many people who told her their goal was to walk the Great Lakes. But as far as she knows, she's only American to have walked so far. Only one other person, Canadian Josephine Mandamin, has gone farther — walking around every single Great Lake to raise the alarm about modern destruction of sacred Native American waters. When Niewenhuis tells people she's been walking the lakes, ""quite a few have said, 'I've always meant to...' and they name that thing they didn't do,"" she says. ""I tell them, that thing, you have to do it. You have to have that thing, that place, that goal. You need to make time for it,"" she says. ""You've got to do it when you can.""

Speaking at a Bible Society debate on ethics in finance, Justin Welby described the financial crisis as a ‘generational problem’ driven by a slump in confidence as much as a breakdown in the markets. He said: ‘What we are in the moment is not a recession but is essentially some kind of depression. It’s going to take something very major to get us out of it in the same way as it took something major to get us into it.’ Speaking at a Bible Society debate on ethics in finance, Justin Welby (pictured at Lady Thatcher's funeral) described the financial crisis as a 'generational problem' driven by a slump in confidence as much as a breakdown in the markets The grim diagnosis comes ahead of the publication of official growth figures on Thursday which are, at best, expected to show Britain narrowly avoided an unprecedented ‘triple dip’ recession. Welby, who sits on the influential banking commission of MPs and peers, called for a ‘revolution’ in banking. RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next 'Don't panic Mr Miliband!' Labour's Diane Abbott tells Ed... Merkel warns eurozone that the EU 'has the last word' on... Share this article Share He said: ‘We need a revolution in the aims of banks so they exist to serve the society they are in. Companies are not self regarding things to maximise returns for shareholders.’ Despite calling for an improvement in ethics and standards at British  lenders, he  argued that  some of the criticism of them has been unfair. The Archbishop's comments echo those of Governor of Bank of England Sir Mervyn King He said: ‘My experience of the last year on the banking commission ruins many of one’s illusions.  They (bankers) don’t come in with horns and a tail burning £50 notes to light large cigars.’ He added:  ‘One of the things they did is borrow short to lend long, a classic error.’ The Archbishop became the latest influential figure to suggest that state backed Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group should be broken up into a ‘good’ bank to lend to the economy and a ‘bad’ bank, storing all their toxic assets. This echoes comments made by Bank of England governor Sir Mervyn King earlier this year. But Welby, who said he was speaking in a personal capacity, also argued a British lender should be broken up into regional banks to better serve their local communities. ‘Part of the banking system should be local, not London based. We need to bring new entrants in, and recapitalise one of the banks and break it up into regional banks.’ Welby’s comments  come after the Church of England vowed last week  to ‘turn the tide’ on a culture of lavish bonuses for bankers and business chiefs. It slammed the ‘culture of entitlement and greed’ in bug businesses, saying it ‘rides roughshod’ over the Christian principles of justice and fairness’. It promised to use the financial firepower of  investments held in its £8billion pension scheme to vote against excessive pay packages. Its investments include Royal Bank of Scotland, Barclays, Shell and Vodafone. Share or comment on this article:

The conflict in Syria may be poised for a sharp escalation, after the U.S. stopped short of affirming that Damascus had used chemical weapons to counter the armed opposition. During a visit to Abu Dhabi, U.S. Defence Secretary Chuck Hagel said the American intelligence community had determined “with varying degrees of confidence that the Syrian regime has used chemical weapons on a small scale in Syria, specifically the chemical agent sarin”. He added that if confirmed, these reports would be a “game changer” in defining U.S.’ role in the conflict. The U.S. has been largely observing the conflict from the sidelines, but President Barack Obama had earlier warned that the Syrian government would be breaching a “red line” if it used chemical weapons. Analysts point out that a firm declaration by the U.S. that Damascus had indeed used chemical weapons would bolster the case for Washington’s direct military intervention in the Syrian conflict. Observers say there are many loopholes in the string of allegations made against Syria. On Thursday, Miguel E Rodriguez, Assistant to the U.S. President and Director, Office of Legislative Affairs, claimed that based on an analysis of “physiological samples”, the White House had made a reassessment that Mr. Assad had used chemical weapons. But in the programme that she anchors, CNN’s chief international correspondent Christiane Amanpour quoted her sources as saying physicians working with the opposition Free Syrian Army had gathered blood samples from alleged chemical warfare victims and supplied them to the U.S. intelligence. Besides, blood samples do not rule out the possibility of a “false flag” attack, where the regime is blamed for an attack perpetrated by its foes. Inconclusive The highly indicative but inconclusive assessment by the U.S. has triggered a chain of events. The Americans have notified the United Nations and its Secretary-General about the alleged use of chemical weapons, Russia Today reported. In his response, the spokesperson for Ban Ki-moon said “the United Nations is not in a position to comment on assessments based on national intelligence information”. But he added that a team of U.N. advisers “have been in contact with the U.S. authorities on the latest developments”. Syrian authorities have so far been unhappy with the position that the U.N. has adopted. In March, Syria had requested a U.N. probe, backed by Russia, on the alleged use of chemical weapons by the armed opposition in the village of Khan al-Assal near Aleppo. In response, the U.N. decided not to include Russian and Chinese experts in the probe team, apparently to avoid bias— a position that caused Vitaly Churkin, Russia’s U.N. envoy, to comment that following this logic he “would recommend excluding all NATO countries too”. The U.N. also decided to deploy throughout the country instead of at the Khan al-Assal site alone, triggering Syria’s decision to deny entry to the team of experts, citing apprehensions that the visiting panel’s findings could become the justification for an Iraq-style invasion. “Syria cannot accept such manoeuvres on the part of the U.N. Secretariat General, bearing in mind the negative role that it played in Iraq and which cleared the way for the American invasion,” a Syrian Foreign Ministry official was earlier quoted as saying.

Search|t Updates Countries Disasters Organizations Topics Jobs Training Informing humanitarians worldwide 24/7 — a service provided by UN OCHA Israel Knesset urged not to pass law that would forcibly evict tens of thousands of Negev/Naqab Bedouin Format News and Press Release Source Amnesty Posted 23 Apr 2013 Originally published 20 Apr 2013 Origin View original Attachments Download Report (PDF | 96.34 KB) AI Index: MDE 15/008/2013 Amnesty International has twice written to ministers in the Israeli government to express serious concerns regarding the proposed “Law for Regularizing Bedouin Habitation in the Negev - 2012” and urged the government not to propose the law and to grant legal status and security of tenure to the excluded Bedouin communities in the Negev/Naqab. The organization is now urging members of the Knesset not to pass the law, which the Ministerial Committee on Legislation is due to consider on 21 April 2013 and in the coming weeks. The draft law is based on the government’s decision of 11 September 2011 (Decision Number 3707) to adopt the recommendations of the committee led by Ehud Prawer for the implementation of the 2008 Report on Regularizing Bedouin Habitation in the Negev, which was prepared by a committee headed by former Justice Eliezer Goldberg. The recommendations of the Prawer committee were submitted to the government on 31 May 2011 and later amended by Major General Ya’akov Amidror, head of the National Security Council. Subsequently, Minister Benny Begin issued a report (the Begin report) on the consultations held with regards to the proposed law. This report was approved by the Israeli cabinet on 27 January 2013. Amnesty International wrote to Minister Benny Begin on 27 August 2012 and to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on 10 February 2013. No response had been received by the time this briefing was published. The new Israeli government formed after elections held on 22 January 2013 has the mandate to propose the draft law to the new Knesset. Neither the draft law nor the Begin report specify where the excluded Bedouin communities will be relocated to, but maps that are appended to the texts delimit an area in the northeast of the Negev/Naqab in which all Bedouin settlement is to be concentrated. Human rights organisations, Bedouin rights organisations, and a statement on 11 September 2011 by the then Director General of the Prime Minister’s office, Eyal Gabai, estimate the number of people displaced by the government’s plan – including by forced evictions – to be 30,000, but it could be higher.

As reported by Armenpress, the French France Press prepared a short video telling that the gathered people sang the song “Ter Vogormia”, after which one of them told the French correspondent: “Even without understanding the words of the song, I am very impressed by it. We never forget about the Tragedy. What had happened was more than just genocide”. The gathered people wore black T-shirts, on which it was written “I am Armenian”. The event was attended also by the President of Dersim Armenian Association Miran Pirginç Gültekin. “Now very many Armenians speak about their Armenian identity and many of them return to their Christian belief. A lot of them prefer to send their children to Armenian schools”, - stated Miran Pirginç Gültekin to the France Press correspondent. The French France 24 TV channel as well highlighted the Armenian Genocide commemoration events. According to it, in comparison with the last years, in 2013 more Armenians from abroad as well participate in the events.

Arutz Sheva staff Apr 28, 2013, 10:57 AM (GMT+3) John Galliano Petition Fashion Antisemitism Designer fashion runway Reuters Students at the Parsons School of Design have launched a petition aimed at imploring the university to repeal its invitation to disgraced fashion designer John Galliano, who has been invited to teach classes at the top New York fashion design institution. A change.org petition, which has already garnered nearly 400 signatures, states: “This is a person who was fired from Dior for his anti-semitic remarks, who Natalie Portman refused to work with because of his remarks, so why is Parsons The New School for Design hiring him?” Galliano, one of the world’s top fashion designers, was dismissed from his position at the Christian Dior label last year after one of his drunken rages at a Parisian bar was made public.  During the confrontation he shouted to a woman: “Dirty Jew, you should be dead.” The incident led to a police investigation and further evidence against the renowned fashion designer, including a video in which he is shown telling two women, “I love Hitler.” “It doesn’t matter if its for three months or three days, hiring someone who has made such horrific comments shows that the school values Galliano over their entire Jewish student body. It shows they value him over their students’ respect, peace of mind, and heritage,” the petition states. “There should be no room for this kind of person as a staff member on the faculty at Parsons,” it adds. “Imagine if the school were hiring a person who publicly voiced support for the KKK — there would likely be backlash because it's not right to have someone like that teaching at a school. But because this is someone who has made anti-Semitic remarks, people are willing to look the other way. This is unacceptable.” Found a mistake?

In an email to users, the company said Tuesday it detected and shut down an attack, but not before the person or persons behind it got access to some basic information. Names, emails, phone numbers, addresses, and some other info were exposed. Information about why customers retained the site's services, ""communication between you and our team,"" and ""any details about the services we provided to you"" were not accessed, the site said in the email to users. Fortunately, the passwords were encrypted, so there's almost no chance the attackers will be able to use the few they took. Reputation.com quickly changed all passwords, and users should be receiving confirmation in an email. No one's financial info or other private data were accessed, reportedly, so there's no danger of fraud — although basic info like phone number and address could be sold to a third party.

A statement issued by QGC in response to the initial Queensland Country Life story from the protest site says the Environmental Authority (EA) for construction of the QCLNG pipeline included provision for use of horizontal directional drilling and open trenching for creek crossings as deemed appropriate. Darling Downs protests against Arrow Hopper wants Condamine CSG ban However, according to the landholder group's chair Dave McCabe it has been confirmed that the department has approved changes to the QGC EA that will now allow QGC to dig a trench through the Columboola Creek bed rather than drilling underneath the watercourse as had been originally stated. The group says it is upset that the changes have been approved and that there was no consultation with landholders prior to the change in the EA. The group says trenching more than 300m of creek banks and the bed of the creek and the use of heavy machinery will result in erosion. ""We want to know why the goverment has now allowed QGC to trench through the creek rather than horiziontally drilling under the creek as was agreed,"" Mr McCabe said. ""The crossing site is currently covered about 1m of water and we are very worried that a trench will result in erosion and impact the water quality for downstream landholders who rely on this creek as their domestic and livestock water supply."" The QGC statement reads: ""During the early stages of planning for this crossing QGC had considered drilling until further detailed study of the crossing determined that open trenching was the most suitable method. ""QGC is confident that trenching represents the most environmentally acceptable method for crossing this part of the creek, a water course that generally flows only in the wet season and which is currently not flowing. ""Both state and federal regulators have approved this method of construction. ""Site surveys by specialist environmental consultants have recorded no nationally protected plants or animals and a specialist independent expert has certified erosion and sediment control plans. ""QGC will use best-practice waterway crossing techniques as defined by the Australian Pipeline Industry Association’s Code of Environmental Practice and comply with the Environmental Authority. ""The landholder on whose property QGC is working has agreed to the pipeline activities,"" the statement concludes. The crossing site is about 15km south east of Miles.

Follow CNN Business Do Not Sell America’s Debt & the Economy Weary air travelers to get a break from furloughs by Jennifer Liberto and Mike Ahlers @CNNMoney April 26, 2013: 1:29 PM ET Airline delays could end this weekend, if Congress passes a bill that would end furloughs of air traffic controllers. Congress' fast-track decision to put air traffic controllers back on the job is a little too late for travelers facing Friday delays. On Friday, the House voted 361-to-41 to give the Federal Aviation Administration more power to move $253 million around to stop furloughs of some 15,000 air traffic controllers, as well as other FAA staffers. President Obama is expected to sign the bill, which sailed through the Senate Thursday night. But White House spokesman Jay Carney called it a ""band aid covering a massive wound to the economy."" ""Congress should do the responsible thing and stop dealing with these issues from crisis to crisis. . .and eliminate the sequester through balanced deficit reduction,"" Carney said. It's a lightning-fast response for Congress. Since Sunday, furloughs of air traffic controllers have delayed more than 3,000 flights, thanks to spending cuts Congress imposed. The FAA expects to tell controllers to go back to work as soon as this weekend, although details had yet to be worked out as of Friday morning, according to a source who wasn't authorized to talk about plans. While Friday is normally one of the busiest travel days, the air space in the New York area was especially clogged , in part because fewer controllers reported for duty. Flights leaving Newark Liberty International Airport were delayed up to 90 minutes. Tampa-bound passengers stuck on LaGuardia Airport's tarmac were told that controller staffing shortages had delayed their flight by 50 minutes. Paulo Pacheco, a New York gastroenterologist on that flight with his husband and kids, said he hoped Congress would be able to get controllers back on the job in time for his return to New York on Sunday. ""I have to get back. I have patients scheduled at 7 a.m. on Monday,"" said Pacheco, who had prepared for the Friday airport delays with books, fruit and iPads for son Niko, 2, and daughter, Isabel, 7. ""We're becoming numb to delays."" Forced spending cuts have led the Federal Aviation Administration to bench about 1,500 controllers from the job each day. Starting last Sunday, several busy airport towers in the New York area, Los Angeles and Chicago have had to space out flight landings, causing delays that ranged between 15 minutes and two hours . Federal furloughs mean flight delays The FAA has said it had no choice. The agency had to cut $600 million from its spending by September, and was planning to achieve that goal by forcing all 47,000 FAA workers to take 11 furlough days, or one day per pay period, through Sept. 30. Its part of the $85 billion in automatic, across-the-board forced spending cuts that went into effect on March 1 . Spending cuts: Reality of furloughs hits home Air traffic controllers weren't the only workers being forced to take unpaid time off. Furloughs also kicked in Sunday for the Environmental Protection Agency and the Office of Management and Budget, joining federal public defenders and Department of Labor employees. If the bill sparing controllers becomes law, FAA employees would join an elite group of federal workers that includes federal meat and poultry inspectors , who were kept on the job thanks in part to lobbying by industries that depend on them. ""Airlines for America commends the Senate for passing the measure to end air traffic controller furloughs,"" said Victoria Day, a spokeswoman for the trade group for airlines , which had also filed a lawsuit trying to block the furloughs last week. The bill allows the FAA to dip into a pot of money for airport improvements to stop furloughs. One area still unclear is whether the FAA will use some of its new powers to restore funding to control towers for regional airports now scheduled to close June 15. The FAA earlier this year announced it would close 149 contract towers , which operate at small- to medium-size airports, to meet its sequester-related cuts. J. Spencer Dickerson, head of an association that represents the towers, said his group hopes the FAA will reverse its decision on the closures. The original bill, by Sen. Susan Collins, a Maine Republican, had directed $220 million to end the controller furloughs as well as $25 million to keep contract towers open. But the bill approved by Congress removed references to the furlough or contract towers, leaving it up to the FAA to decide how to apply funds, he said. -- CNNMoney's Tami Luhby contributed to this report.

By BENJAMIN WEINTHAL , JERUSALEM POST CORRESPONDENT DECEMBER 1, 2012 01:47 AIPAC 370 (photo credit: REUTERS) BERLIN – Pertti Salolainen, Finland’s vice chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, asserted on the state television program YLE Aamu TV on Thursday that American Jews hold vast control over the wealth and media in the United States and that impedes the US government from remaining neutral toward the Palestinians. Salolainen’s remarks sparked sharp criticism from the Simon Wiesenthal Center, an international human rights group with its headquarters in Los Angeles, and the Finnish media watchdog website Tundra Tabloids. While discussing the UN General Assembly vote to upgrade the Palestinian delegation to non-member observer state status, Salolainen said, “Now about the United States, it finds it difficult to take a more neutral stance on the Israel-Palestine issue because they have a large Jewish population who have a significant control of the money and the media. The US for internal political reasons is afraid to become adequately involved. This is a sad truth about US politics.” Finland’s government voted in favor of the Palestinians’ status upgrade. Mark Weitzman, from the Wiesenthal Center, wrote to Ritva Koukku- Ronde, the Finnish ambassador to the US, condemning the decision. “That such remarks can come from a pillar of the political elite in Finland is dismaying and astonishing; but that this remark was unchallenged makes it appear that such ideas are part of acceptable discourse in Finland,” he wrote. Weitzman continued that Finland joined the International Task Force for Holocaust Education, Research and Remembrance and “at this point, Finland must immediately act to show that it remains committed to these ideals,” by officially condemning and repudiating Salolainen’s remarks. He called on the Finnish government to take steps to remove the parliamentarian from any official position. The pro-Israel Helsinki-based website Tundra Tabloids posted a translation of Salolainen’s comments and the television clip with a translation. Tundra Tabloids termed Salolainen “a part-time anti-Semite” and said he propagated a modern version of the 19th century anti-Semitic document Protocols of the Elders of Zion with his diatribe of Jew-hatred and conspiracy theories. When asked in early November by The Jerusalem Post if statements from Hezbollah calling for the murder of Jews and Israelis and praise for Holocaust denial are anti-Semitic, Pekka Marttila, from the Finnish Foreign Ministry, refused to answer.

Need help figuring it out? The LA Times can help. Learn more about Earth Day . The Old Farmer's Almanac credits Jerry McConnell, an activist from San Francisco, and Gaylord Nelson, a U.S. senator from Wisconsin, for calling for national grassroots demonstrations of support for environmental issues. McConnell's demonstration took place on the spring equinox, March 21, 1970. Nelson's was a month later, on April 22, 1970. According to the Almanac, ""the most common practice of celebration is to plant new trees for Earth Day.""

V. Jayaram, special judge, issued directions to register a case against M. Bhaskaran, former Mayor and Kozhikode district secretariat member of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) [CPI-M]; K. Narayanan, former project manager, Kerala Sustainable Urban Development Project (KSUDP); and P. Remeshan, president, Uralungal Labour Contract Co-operative Society Ltd (ULCCS). The Dy.SP has been asked to register the case within May 30 and submit the First Information Report (FIR) before the court under section 156 (3) [any magistrate empowered to order investigation] of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The construction of the mini-bypass road had incurred a loss, with the Corporation providing additional amount to the contractor, the court observed. Previously a petition in this regard was moved by K.P. Sathyakrishnan on behalf of the Corporation Anti-Corruption Campaign Committee on May 8, 2012. The court had on June 4, 2012 ordered an investigation after finding there was a prima facie case in the allegations. The petitioner has alleged that the project, aided by the Asian Development Bank (ADB), had been awarded to the ULCCS for Rs.32 crore. However, the civic body had paid an additional amount of Rs.6 crore to the contractor after the completion of the work. This was in breach of the agreement reached between the Corporation and the contractor at the time of awarding the work. Therefore the complaint should be investigated. Loss to civic body The complainant alleged that the Corporation suffered a loss of Rs.11,35,520 and produced documents to support the allegations. However, the Dy.SP, who investigated the case submitted a report stating that the loss was Rs.7, 09,700 and recommended that the amount be recovered from the contractor with an annual interest of 12 per cent. Previously the Corporation Anti-Corruption Campaign Committee filed a complaint before VACB Director Mahesh Kumar Singla against the failure of Dy.SP A.J. George to register a case on the allegations. K.P. Vijayakumar, convener, Corporation Anti-Corruption Campaign Committee, said that the project had been completed during the regime of the previous council. However, the fund had been allotted to the contractor by the present council, he said.

Illustration: Sreejith Kumar It sounded too good to be true — Etihad paying a huge premium of 32 per cent over the market price to pick up just 24 per cent equity in Jet Airways. Large premiums are usually associated with a transfer of control but Etihad was not getting into the pilot’s seat of Jet Airways. The equity stake was also not big enough to make a difference as an investor as Etihad would still be unable to block special resolutions at shareholder meetings. Throw in the fact that Jet is not exactly in the pink of health. With accumulated losses of over Rs.1,900 crore and borrowings of over Rs.13,000 crore, the airline is hardly an attractive investment candidate. So, how was Etihad persuaded to part with such a large premium for a small stake? Devil in the details The answer came immediately after the deal was made public. The government announced an increase in the bilateral weekly seats between India and Abu Dhabi to 36,670 seats a week from 13,330 at present. That’s almost a three-fold rise and is a huge shot in the arm for the small emirate of Abu Dhabi whose national carrier is Etihad. In the airline industry, seat capacities between two countries are decided through bilateral agreements with each country then apportioning its share to different airlines registered there. In the case of Etihad, it is the national carrier for Abu Dhabi and will enjoy the whole share of the emirate’s bilateral seats. The increased seats will help Etihad, which was started just a decade ago in 2003, to convert Abu Dhabi into a regional hub to rival Dubai. Jet plans to fly out of two-dozen Indian cities, predominantly Tier-II and Tier-III, to Abu Dhabi and drive passenger traffic headed onward to destinations in North America, Europe, Africa and the Middle East. Etihad will also be free to increase frequencies into the current destinations in India that it flies to apart from adding new ones, of course, in coordination with Jet. The increase in bilateral capacity puts the premium that Etihad paid in perspective but should the government have initiated the increase to help a private airline to cement a deal? Though it might deny a connection, it should be evident to any industry watcher that the two events are related. Jet has been the beneficiary of a number of questionable moves by the government in the past decade and more. The denial of permission to the Tatas to start an airline in association with Singapore Airlines in the mid-nineties, the imposition of stringent conditions on domestic operators for flying international routes such as a five-year track record and the mismanagement of Air India have all helped Jet grow in its business. The increase in bilateral capacity with Abu Dhabi is one more in this list. The silver lining But competition is not complaining, at least not yet. The simple reason for this is that the increased capacity opens up the market for them too though it remains to be seen how the extra seats are now apportioned by the government amongst the various airlines that might want to fly to Abu Dhabi. SpiceJet and Indigo are likely to stake immediate claim while Air India may join them, its financial position permitting. The condemnable decision of the government to change policy to aid a particular airline will now be exploited by others. It is well known that SpiceJet has been in talks with some foreign airlines for collaboration on similar lines as Jet-Etihad. Indigo, though it is the healthiest and best run airline in India, is not interested in a foreign tie-up yet but there is no question that it is ripe picking for any foreign carrier. On the other side, established Gulf carriers such as Emirates and Qatar Airways have been demanding increase in capacities into India and the government may just have opened itself up to pressure by its move with Abu Dhabi. Emirates has developed Dubai as a regional hub and will be loathe to see smaller Abu Dhabi, a newbie to the industry, steal that position. Similar combinations such as Jet-Etihad are therefore a distinct possibility. India is a large market in the region and has been growing at an impressive pace in the last decade. Aviation consultancy, Centre for Asia Pacific Aviation (CAPA), has estimated that international passenger traffic from India grew at a compounded annual growth rate of 11.8 per cent between 2004 and 2012. In 2011-12 alone it grew a whopping 16 per cent to a little over 40 million passengers. Limiting factor The only limiting factor to growth has been availability of seats and carriers, not just from the Gulf but also those such as Singapore Airlines and Cathay Pacific, are bound to demand an increase in bilateral capacities quoting the Abu Dhabi precedent. The government’s problem will be that any increase will benefit the foreign carriers more than the domestic ones given that Air India is in no position to exploit the high capacities and the other private airlines may not have the aircraft capacity to cash in. The ones to benefit the most from all this are passengers. The Jet-Etihad deal could well stimulate the next round of competition, especially in the Gulf and on-bound passengers market. There is already fair competition through the presence of several airlines and hubs such as Frankfurt, London, Brussels, Istanbul, Dubai and Doha for on-bound passengers to North American destinations. The addition of Abu Dhabi and the combination of Jet-Etihad will only intensify this competition leading to a fall in fares. But is this enough justification for a policy change that blatantly supports a corporate deal? raghuvir.s@thehindu.co.in Published - April 28, 2013 10:18 pm IST Read Comments Copy link Email Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit READ LATER Remove SEE ALL PRINT Related stories Etihad deal with Jet provides for stake increase in future Etihad to co-pilot Jet Airways Related Topics air transport / stock splits Top News Today 0 / 0 Read in App The Hindu About Us Code of Editorial Values News Archive Sitemap Print Subscription Digital Subscription Subscribe to Newsletters Rss Feeds Readers Editor-Terms of Reference Authors & Contributors Frame Front page Contact us Contact Us Social Media Advertise With Us Group News Sites Business Line BL on Campus Sportstar Frontline இந்து தமிழ் திசை The Hindu Centre Young World Club The Hindu ePaper Business Line ePaper Crossword + Free Games Other Products RoofandFloor STEP Images Classifieds - Print Bookstore & Special Publications Popular Sections Elections Israeli–Palestinian conflict 2023 Latest News National News International News Videos Life & Style Food Podcast Showcase Opinion Editorial Columns Comment Cartoon Letters Interview Lead Business Agri-Business Industry Economy Markets Budget Sport Cricket Football Hockey Tennis Athletics Motorsport Races Other Sports Sci-Tech Science Technology Health Agriculture Environment Gadgets Internet States Andhra Pradesh Karnataka Kerala Tamil Nadu Telangana Cities Bengaluru Chennai Coimbatore Delhi Hyderabad Kochi Kolkata Kozhikode Madurai Mangaluru Mumbai Puducherry Thiruvananthapuram Tiruchirapalli Vijayawada Visakhapatnam Trending on The Hindu India News Ratan Tata passes away LIVE News J & K Election results LIVE Indian men’s team wins rapid fire pistol gold Himachal CM says no toilet tax in State Google says it will stop linking to New Zealand news if a law passes forcing it to pay for content West Bengal junior doctors continue sit-in Google tests verified check marks in search results Jugaad vs sustainable education Trending on Group sites Stock Market Live Updates Stocks to buy today IND vs BAN Mogun Bagan Paralympics 2024 Gold Rate Today Silver Rate Today Sexual Harassment in Telugu Film Industry Mango: The Michael Jackson of Fruits Frontline Current Issue Terms of Use Privacy Policy Copyright© 2024, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

A poll conducted on behalf of Globes daily business newspaper says that 83% of Israelis would not even consider the possibility of a vacation in Turkey this summer – and among those that would consider it, an extremely small percentage have actually reserved spots in Turkish hotels. Just a few years ago, the choice of summer vacation for many Israelis was the resort coastal area of Turkey, with resort hotels catering to all their needs for an extremely competitive price – with a full package of lodging, meals, and flight often coming out to less than an equivalent vacation in Eilat. That all ended in 2009, in the wake of Turkey's criticism of Operation Cast Lead. By summer 2010, after the Mavi Maramara incident, in which 9 Turkish terrorist sympathizers were killed after they tried to murder IDF troops, almost no Israelis were traveling to Turkey, for any purpose – and the situation has remained more or less unchanged since then. After last month's apology by Israel to Turkey over the Mavi Marmara incident, tourist agencies and organizers believed that Israelis would begin considering Turkey for their summer travel plans. But according to the poll published Thursday in Globes, Israelis who have changed their vacation habits are not rushing back to Turkey. In fact, even among the 17% of Israelis who said they would consider a Turkish vacation, there seemed to be little practical enthusiasm for the idea. Only 0.2% of Israelis in that group have actually reserved places in a Turkish resort for this summer. Travel industry officials said that it was possible that the percentage could rise, because many people did not make their summer vacation plans until May or June, but admitted that the “bump” from late vacation planners was unlikely to change that percentage significantly. Out of the 509 people in the representative sample polled, over 60% have vacationed in Turkey before. Found a mistake?

Authorities announced Sunday that they detained Mohammed Sohel Rana near the border with India. Rana had been missing since the building's collapse on Wednesday. His arrest came a day after authorities took at least two plant bosses and two engineers into custody. So far, authorities have arrested seven people total in connection with the collapse. Police say Rana and factory managers ignored official warnings for people to evacuate the building after inspectors found cracks in it Tuesday. On Sunday, emergency workers continued to pull survivors from the wreckage. They have been working with hand tools since the incident, but officials say they will soon have to start using cranes to sift through the ruins. Authorities had put off using heavy equipment in hopes of protecting any survivors left in the structure. The complex that collapsed just outside Dhaka housed five garment factories. About 30 people were rescued Saturday. More than 2,400 people have been rescued since the building collapsed, with at least half of them injured. More than 3,000 people were in the building outside Dhaka when it collapsed. Authorities still do not know exactly how many people are missing. Protesting garment workers took the streets of the capital Dhaka again on Sunday to demonstrate against the country's poor industrial safety standards. Hundreds of textile workers clashed with police Thursday. Some workers blame European and American companies for the poor working conditions because the companies demand low-cost goods from the garment manufacturers. A fire at another garment factory in Bangladesh killed more than 100 workers in November.

Apr 28, 2013, 01:20pm EDT Updated Apr 28, 2013, 01:20pm EDT This article is more than 10 years old. Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Tyler Cowen highlighted Paul Collier's new book : As Collier shows, those who migrate from the poorest countries, primarily though not exclusive the young, tend to be the best educated and most energetic in their cultures. And while migrants often benefit economically, the larger impacts of mass migrations remain unsettling. The danger is that both host countries and sending societies may lose their national identities– an outcome that Collier suggests would be disastrous as national identity is a powerful force for equity. Collier asserts that migration must be restricted to ensure that it helps those who remain in sending countries and also benefits host societies that make the investment on which migrant gains rely. This is, to my mind at least (although I have some support from Don Boudreaux ) a morally reprehensible way of looking at the world. The clear intention is that migration must be restricted for while it may indeed benefit the people who do it it might not society as a whole. Which is to take an excessively statist view of the world to my mind. What benefits the whole society should indeed be a consideration but not at the expense of people being able to live their own lives as and where they wish. The only restrictions on that are direct physical harm to others: Mill's idea that my freedom  so swing my fist ends where your nose begins. It's also a very strange idea economically: we know very well that migration is the most effective anti-poverty program there is. There's even a group of economists calling for much greater migration for exactly this reason. And then there's Collier's mind boggling assertion that he would restrict migration in the name of equity. For the largest inequity in the world at present is that inequity between incomes in the poor countries and the rich. As Branco Milanovic points out (page 41, here ) the global inequality of incomes is now mostly a product simply of the luck (good or ill) of where you happened to be born. To demand that you cannot decide to reduce that inequality through migration is not to pay due heed to equity, it is to deny entirely the possibility of ameliorating that inequity. There's an echo of a distinctly socialist (OK, some socialists perhaps not all) idea here as well. That the people of a nation somehow belong to hte state of that nation, rather than the state just being a mechanism to decide who picks up the garbage. It was this that was used by the East Germans to justify the Berlin Wall: too many valuable workers were leaving, they should be forced to stay and build communism. That's an idea that any liberal should reject out of hand. Unfortunately, it doesn't look like Collier has.

By James Brooks 30 April 2013 • 1:57pm Crown Prince Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands ,flanked by Princess Maxima, smiles after signing the Act of Abdication of his mother, The Netherlands' Queen Beatrix Credit : Photo: AFP Born on May 17 1971, Maxima received an economics degree in 1995, eventually working for a string of international banks in her hometown of Buenos Aires, then New York and Brussels. Her father, Jorge, was a junior agriculture minister under the notorious Argentine regime of General Jorge Videla in the 1970s. Under Videla's military dictatorship, the regime waged a 'Dirty War' against political opponents, being help responsible for the disappearance of up to 30,000 people during their tyrannical five-year reign. Following popular outcry in the politically correct Netherlands , Maxima's father was told he could not attend his daughter's wedding in Amsterdam in 2002. Her mother also stayed away out of solidarity. After the couple's ceremony, Maxima was given Dutch nationality and allowed to remain a Catholic in the staunchly Protestant House of Orange. The couple have three daughters, Catharina-Amalia, 9, who as the heir apparent will become the Princess of Orange, Alexia, 7, and Ariane, 5. With her easy charm and ready smile, Princess Maxima was quick to win over the Dutch people, immersing herself in the language and culture of her adopted country and even swimming in an Amsterdam canal for charity. The future queen was also instrumental in transforming the reputation of her husband, whose younger years as a boozing university student had led to doubts over his suitability as head of the House of Orange. In 2009, the future queen was named as the UN Secretary General's special advocate for inclusive finance for development, due to her work supporting microcredit initiatives in developing countries. Her time as princess was not completely without controversy; in 2007, whilst commenting about Dutch identity, Maxima said: ""The Dutch person does not exist, no more than the Argentinian"". The remark sparked criticism and suggestions that she had spoken out of turn.

More carbon dioxide is released from residential lawns than corn fields according to a new study. And much of the difference can likely be attributed to soil temperature. The data, from researchers at Elizabethtown College, suggest that urban heat islands may be working at smaller scales than previously thought. !ADVERTISEMENT! These findings provide a better understanding of the changes that occur when agricultural lands undergo development and urbanization to support growing urban populations. David Bowne, assistant professor of biology, led the study to look at the amount of carbon dioxide being released from residential lawns versus corn fields in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. His co-author, Erin Johnson, was an undergraduate at the time of the study and did the work as part of her senior honors thesis. Their findings were published online today in Soil Science Society of America Journal. For Bowne, the study allowed him to look beyond the obvious impact of losing agricultural fields to development -- the loss of food that was once produced on the land. ""That is a legitimate concern, but I wanted to look more at how this change could potentially impact the carbon cycle with the understanding that the carbon cycle has implications for global climate change,"" explains Bowne.

        Pop , Berlin, With its record-low unemployment (5.4%), Germany stands out among fellow eurozone countries such as France or Spain, suffering from sky-high jobless rates. Part of Germany's success is due to a series of reforms pushed through by the Social-Green government of former chancellor Gerhard Schroeder ten years ago, overhauling the labour market and welfare system.

Germany stands out among fellow eurozone countries such as France or Spain, suffering from sky-high jobless rates. Part of Germany's success is due to a series of reforms pushed through by the Social-Green government of former chancellor Gerhard Schroeder ten years ago, overhauling the labour market. But the German labour market is still far from perfect, as shown by recent events.
In a major change of policy, the current coalition government of Chancellor Angela Merkel is now pursuing a much more pro-market, deregulatory agenda in order to lower the cost of hiring and firing. It is cutting the tax for hiring new staff and easing restrictions on firing, even if the latter are still more stringent than in the US. Such a policy is supposed to lower the cost of hiring new staff and thereby stimulate hiring. Yet, the government is careful to ensure that these changes do not reduce employment opportunities for those already in employment, as it fears this might have a negative impact on social cohesion and social peace.
But, how will these new measures affect the German labour market? Will they be an overall improvement? What are the prospects for the German labour market model? Will Germany be able to maintain its growth momentum?

The FBI arrested 18-year-old Abdella Ahmad Tounisi in Chicago late Friday as he prepared to board a plane for Turkey. A federal judge is expected to decide next week whether to release Tounisi on bond or keep him in custody. Authorities say Tounisi, a U.S. citizen, made online contact with an FBI agent posing as a terrorist recruiter. Tounisi reportedly told the agent he was willing to die for the cause and was planning to travel to Syria through Turkey. An FBI statement says Tounisi is a close friend of Adel Daoud, who is charged with trying to detonate a bomb outside a Chicago bar last year. But the agency says Tounisi has no connection to last week's deadly bombing attack in Boston. If convicted, Tounisi faces a maximum of 15 years in prison.

The building that housed the factory had collapsed, killing hundreds of workers and leaving survivors trapped. https://p.dw.com/p/18O92 Image: imago/Xinhua Advertisement Police on Saturday arrested the chairman and managing director of a garment factory housed at a collapsed eight-story building, while the death toll climbed to 351 people as rescuers struggled to free survivors from the rubble. ""We've arrested Bazlus Samad, the chairman of New Wave Buttons and New Wave Style factories and Mahmudur Rahaman Tapash, a managing director of one of the plants, after midnight,"" Deputy Police Chief Shyaml Mukherjee told the AFP news agency. Police also arrested two government engineers who gave the building the all-clear during an inspection the day before its collapse. All four face charges of death due to negligence. The building in Savar, a suburb of the capital Dhaka, had reportedly shown cracks in its walls on Tuesday. Police ordered the structure evacuated, but the owners allegedly told the more than 3,000 people employed there to return to work. The building's owner, Mohammed Sohel Rana, only had a permit for a five-story structure. But he added three stories illegally, according to Abdul Halim, an official with Savar's engineering department.  The prime minister has also ordered the arrest of Sohel Rana, who is still on the run. His wife has been detained for questioning. ""Those who're involved, especially the owner who forced the workers to work there, will be punished,"" Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina told Bangladeshi lawmakers. ""Wherever he is, he will be found and brought to justice."" Survivors trapped in rubble Meanwhile, rescuers struggled to free survivors from the rubble, while victims' family members clashed with baton-wielding police as they tried to access the site. Police said some 50 people were injured in those clashes ""We want to go inside the building and find our people now,"" Shahinur Rahman, whose mother was missing, told the Associated Press. At least 29 people were pulled alive from the rubble on Saturday. But the heat and dehydration threatened to get to the trapped survivors first, with temperatures of 35 degrees Celsius (95 degrees Fahrenheit) and about 24 degrees Celsius (75 degrees Fahrenheit) at night.

Alexei Navalny accused of heading a group that embezzled $500,000 in timber from state-owned firm[Reuters] Published On 24 Apr 2013 24 Apr 2013 The trial has resumed in the case against a Russian opposition leader who led protests against President Vladimir Putin and exposed alleged corruption in his government. Alexei Navalny was back in court on Wednesday accused of heading an organised criminal group that embezzled $500,000 worth of timber from a state-owned company. The charges not only threaten to send Navalny to prison, but strike at the essence of his image as an anti-corruption activist. Navalny insists the charges are an act of revenge for his exposure of high-level corruption and are intended to silence him. The trial began last week in the northwestern city of Kirov, but was adjourned until Wednesday at the request of the defence, which said Navalny had not been given enough time to read the case files.

Lt. Col. Samuel House announced on Saturday that 100 of the 166 prisoners at the American military base in Cuba have now joined the strike, amid insistence by some inmate lawyers that all of the detainees have joined the hunger strike to protest their indefinite detention. According to Col. House, 19 of the hunger strikers are currently being force-fed with liquid nutrients through a nasal tube in efforts to prevent dangerous weight loss. The military official further stated that five of protesting inmates have been transferred to the camp’s hospital for observation, adding that they do not have any life-threatening conditions. Lawyers for the detainees have repeatedly challenged the figures released by the authorities, emphasizing that the military is undercounting the number of hunger strikers. The Guantanamo detainees began the hunger strike in February to protest poor prison conditions and their indefinite confinement without charges or any chance for a legal trial.

Matters YOU US TNS Business Honda lifts profit forecasts By AFP February 02, 2019 Tokyo: Japan´s Honda Motor said Friday it was revising up forecasts for its full-year net profit despite logging a fall of 34.5 percent for the nine months to December.The country´s third-largest automaker revised up its full year net profit to 695 billion yen ($6.3 billion) from the previous forecast of 675 billion yen, while also lifting annual sales to 15.85 trillion yen from 15.80 trillion. For April-December, net profit fell to 623.3 billion yen ""due mainly to the impacts of the enactment of the US tax cuts and Jobs Act in the same period last year"", Honda said. Operating profit fell 3.2 percent mainly because of decreased sales revenue, as well as increased sales and administrative costs and ""negative foreign currency effects"", it added. The company said auto sales in Japan grew 4.4 percent but US sales slipped 2.6 percent to 1.242 million units. Sales in China, where the economy is suffering a growth slowdown, also fell. But motorcycle sales climbed 6.6 percent in emerging Asian markets including India, Vietnam, Thailand and Indonesia, it said. ""Honda has been enjoying strong sales of motorcycles especially in Southeast Asia,"" Satoru Takada, an analyst at TIW, a Tokyo-based research and consulting firm, told AFP ahead of the earnings report. ""Motorcycles are Honda´s advantage, which its rivals do not have,"" he said. But he added that ""Japanese carmakers are bracing for the impact of the US-China trade dispute, which has already been visible on raw material costs.""

European Commissioner for Humanitarian Aid and Crisis Response Kristalina Georgieva said latest data show there are 1.3 million refugees created by the Syrian war. There are an additional 11,000 refugees created every 36 hours given recent trends, she said. Advertisement Apart from the internal strife, Georgieva said an escalating crisis in Syria could bring a ""humanitarian catastrophe of unimaginable proportions"" closer to European borders. ""The crisis in Syria is the one with the most dramatic spillover risks that exists today and could have dramatic consequences for the region, and, therefore, Europe,"" she said in a statement to lawmakers. The European Parliament this week allocated $25.3 million in humanitarian assistance for internally displaced Syrians and those seeking refuge in neighboring countries. The European Union this week eased sanctions that would permit cooperation with Syrian rebels in the energy sector. ""Providing oil revenues to people will be complicated but it can improve the situation of ordinary Syrians if it is allocated in priority for humanitarian needs,"" Georgieva said.

Kerry said Monday that Mr. Karzai's defense minister will attend along with Pakistan's military chief and its foreign minister. The meeting is part of a series of discussions moderated by the United States. Afghan officials have become increasingly frustrated with Islamabad over attempts to pursue peace efforts with the Taliban, which has close ties to Pakistan's security services. Taliban forces publicly say they will not engage in peace talks with the Karzai government. The reconciliation process has had several setbacks, including the assassination of Mr. Karzai's hand-picked negotiator. The Afghan president has said Pakistan must be involved in any peace efforts with the Taliban. Kerry said the talks would also focus on the handover of security responsibilities to Afghan forces this year, ahead of the pullout of foreign forces from the country at the end of 2014. Only a few thousand NATO troops would remain in Afghanistan after that time, compared with about 100,000 now.

But it is clear from the first leaders debate Friday that the issue has become a political millstone for the New Democrats. It has dominated the campaign since Mr. Dix stunned many on Earth Day by declaring his opposition to Kinder Morgan's plans. This, after saying as recently as two weeks earlier that as a ""matter of principle"" he wouldn't prejudge the project before the company had a chance to submit its complete proposal to the National Energy Board later this year. The NDP Leader has maintained that his thinking on the matter evolved over time. He has said the tipping point was when he learned that Kinder Morgan was planning to increase the amount of oil it was going to move through the new pipeline. At his Earth Day announcement, Mr. Dix said he did not believe that Vancouver should become a major oil-exporting port, something he says would happen if the pipeline expansion went ahead. The number of big oil tankers entering the port would increase several fold, he has maintained, increasing the likelihood of a spill. Not surprisingly, the subject was highlighted in the first half hour of the leaders debate on the Bill Good radio show on CKNW. Liberal Leader Christy Clark used her opponent's about-face to expose him as a flip-flopper. She criticized him for taking a position ahead of an environmental review process. After previously coming out against the Northern Gateway pipeline, Mr. Dix is being accused of being anti-business and anti-development, labels he has been fighting hard to shake off. Ms. Clark is also now suggesting that Mr. Dix arrived at his position in January and ""kept it concealed,"" until the election campaign. ""It makes you wonder what else Mr. Dix is concealing,"" Ms. Clark said on the radio. Being in the desperate position that she is – 14 points behind in the polls with just two weeks left in the campaign – Ms. Clark is now trying to cast the NDP Leader's announcement in a more sinister light. On this point, the Liberal Leader is completely wrong. Ms. Clark is basing her ""secret agenda"" line of attack on a recent story by Globe and Mail reporter Justine Hunter. Based on an interview with Mr. Dix, her piece said the NDP Leader made up his mind to oppose the project after Kinder Morgan ""signalled its expanded ambitions for the project in January."" Ms. Clark is suggesting that implies January is when Mr. Dix made his decision when, in fact, it only suggests he made up his mind ""some time after"" the beginning of the year. Despite Ms. Hunter's best efforts during the interview, Mr. Dix steadfastly refused to say when, exactly, he did decide to change his position. That leaves us to guess as to his motive and one of the best deductions making the rounds is that the NDP saw recent polling numbers that suggested the party was vulnerable in a number of key ridings because of the Green Party – something the New Democrats felt they could undercut by taking a position against Kinder Morgan. But while it may have helped fend off the Greens, the NDP's new policy has almost certainly helped Ms. Clark and the Liberals. Whether you agree with Mr. Dix's stand or not, declaring a project dead ahead of an environmental review process is not very statesmanlike. It looks amateurish, especially against the backdrop of a previously held – and much-ballyhooed – matter of principle position. It allows the Liberals to cast the New Democrats as anti-development. It allows the Liberals to ask in the heat of an election campaign: How does an NDP government intend to pay for all its campaign promises if it is going to oppose every development project that environmental groups do not like? Has Mr. Dix forgotten about the tens of thousands of jobs the resource sector creates in B.C.? Does he not believe in due process? Kinder Morgan provided Ms. Clark with her finest moments in Friday's debate. Mr. Dix seemed flustered talking about the issue. But the Liberal Leader had her low points too, most notably when questioned about B.C.'s miserable child-poverty record under Liberal government. That is Mr. Dix's sweet spot and an issue he cares passionately about. Green Party Leader Jane Sterk showed well in the debate too, particularly around this subject. B.C. Conservative Party Leader John Cummins was reserved. My guess is that during the TV debate on Monday, the last time the leaders will square off before the May 14 election, there will be one topic Ms. Clark will be coming back to time and time again. Mr. Dix may want to brush up on his answers. Please enable JavaScript to view this content.

Sat Apr 27 2013 - 06:00 An oil executive was yesterday branded a liar for evidence he gave in a multi-million pound tax case taken by Tullow Oil in London. The chief financial officer of Heritage Oil, Paul Atherton, was described as a “patently dishonest witness” as Tullow closed its legal battle over a £209.5 million tax bill. He was said to have lied under cross examination, as the court was urged not to accept anything he said unless it was corroborated by another witness. Tullow’s lawyer, David Wolfson QC, said: “He was a patently dishonest witness, and that is not a submission I enjoy making. “Quite apart from the fact that he took an oath, there really was no need for him to lie about anything. READ MORE Tullow is seeking to recover a tax bill it paid in Uganda on behalf of Heritage. It had been suggested during evidence that Tullow executives discussed paying a bung to Ugandan president Yoweri Museveni, based on an email sent between Tullow executives. But Mr Wolfson said the document in question contained “no hint of any suggestion” that a payment would be made to the president. He said the allegations against the president had caused “serious ongoing issues” in Uganda. 'Irrelevant' ""Heritage's insinuations were irrelevant to the issues that arose in the case,"" he said. Tullow has brought the case against Heritage after paying $1.45 billion for a 50 per cent share in three huge Ugandan oil fields back in 2010. The Ugandan government then demanded $313 million from Heritage in capital gains tax on the deal. Tullow said it was then forced to pay Heritage’s disputed tax bill so that it could secure approval on the sales of two 33 per cent interests in the fields in early 2011. It is suing Heritage for the return of the tax money, claiming the smaller firm should have ultimately footed the bill. If Tullow can prove it believed the claim from the Ugandan government to be legitimate,it will win the case. Kwahar Quereshi, representing Heritage, later yesterday accused Tullow of colluding with the Ugandan government in making its tax claim against his client. “Tullow’s collusion with the Government/URA, in terms of both the time period and scope of the matters involved, was as wide ranging as it could have been.” He attacked company secretary Alan Graham Martin for destroying key documents in the build up to the case, which may have detailed this collusion. Documents destroyed Mr Martin admitted destroying documents during his cross-examination, saying he ""got rid of a lot of notes when [he] left Kampala"". He said the notes were crucial in determining whether the company had changed its mind on the validity of the tax claim made against them, as well as providing any evidence of collusion with the Ugandan government. He claimed Tullow was trying to rely on a draft document of legal advice from a Ugandan lawyer as evidence it believed the tax claim was valid.

Over the past two months, terrorists in Gaza have been firing sporadically across the border, ending a period of calm that followed November’s Operation of Pillar of Defense. ""A mortar shell struck an uninhabited area in the Eshkol region near the security fence between Israel and the Gaza Strip,"" an army spokeswoman said according to the AFP news agency. The incident came 24 hours after Israeli warplanes launched air strikes against the southern Gaza town of Khan Yunis, targeting weapons depots and a training site for the armed wing of Islamic Jihad, the military said. The strikes, which came in response to a rocket that hit open fields in southern Israel on Saturday, caused no casualties. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told Sunday's weekly cabinet meeting that Israel would retaliate with great force against any rocket or missile fire. ""I want to make it clear that we will respond in a very offensive way against any rockets or missiles. We will take all necessary measures to ensure the security of Israelis... on all fronts,"" he said. Israel had not carried out air raids on Gaza since early April, when it launched the first strikes in response to rocket attacks launched by Hamas terrorists in the Gaza strip. On April 19, two rockets fired from the Gaza Strip hit southern Israel without causing any casualties or damage. Netanyahu had last week vowed Israel would ""exact a price"" from the Gaza terrorists who fired missiles from Sinai at the southern resort city of Eilat on April 17. Found a mistake?

In the United States, the difficult-to-trace digital currency Bitcoin is largely unregulated. Recently, the Treasury Department has issued some guidelines , though they remain rather broad. The regulatory environment in Canada, however, is rather more strict, as several Bitcoin entrepreneurs have found out. Bitcoin drew international attention through Cyprus’s banking emergency , its inclusion in the American financial regulatory framework , and increasing press coverage . The currency recently spiked to as high as $266 before crashing to a low of about $50, then rebounding to a post-crash high of $162. Canadians James Grant of Canadian Bitcoins and Melvin Ng of CADBitcoin both run Bitcoin exchanges, where users can convert Canadian dollars to bitcoins and vice versa. Both were contacted by banking authorities and told that their business accounts had been frozen. The Royal Bank of Canada and TDBank , which froze the accounts, have not explained their reasoning. To Grant, it is simple. “They don’t like bitcoins,” he said to Business Insider. Joseph David, proprietor of Canada’s largest Bitcoin exchange, VirtEx , which was shut down temporarily in 2011, told the publication he thought perhaps the businessmen had not “obtained the proper money service licensing.” Ng, however, said he had done so. The shutdown was enough to convince Ng to leave the exchange business. He is now setting up a chain of Bitcoin-only stores in Canada.

The activists, from the Zochrot organization, called to give Arabs the land on which the Arab village of Deir Yassin once stood.  The villagers of Deir Yassin were expelled by pre-state military groups in a battle controversially termed the “Deir Yassin massacre” due to the large number of Arab civilians killed. Right-wing activists held a counter-protest at the scene. “We joined the march held by the extreme-left anarchist group Zochrot, in which Jews and Arabs are taking part… they are going between the homes that survived the War of Independence,” activist Baruch Marzel told Arutz Sheva. “We wish them more ‘Nakbas’ and more Deir Yassins,” he said. “Nakba” (literally “disaster”) is the term commonly used in the Arab world to refer to the establishment of the modern state of Israel. “They want the state of Israel to be destroyed,” Marzel accused. “They won’t tell me that we need to return to the homes in Hevron that Jews were expelled from, but they do want to return Arabs to Deir Yassin, a village whose residents were expelled while fighting Jews.” “Those who expelled them and killed the terrorists and murderers who came from here and who disturbed traffic to Jerusalem before the War of Independence deserve respect,” he added. Police were called to the scene after some right-wing activists ripped up signs carried by left-wing activists. Officers arrested several right-wing activists and ordered the two sides to separate.

My Account Sign In Sign Out Home :: WMD :: Library :: News :: Syria :: 2013 :: April :: Military WMD Menu Introduction Systems Facilities Agencies Operations Countries Hot Documents News Reports Policy Budget Congress Links Intelligence Homeland Security Space Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) Syria using chemical weapons against militants: Israel Iran Press TV Tue Apr 23, 2013 4:40PM GMT A senior Israeli military intelligence official claims that Syria is using chemical weapons against militants fighting against the Damascus government. Brigadier General Itai Brun, head of the research and analysis division of Israeli military intelligence, said on Tuesday that Syrian troops have probably used Sarin, a lethal nerve agent, against militants on several occasions in the past few months. He also said the Syrian government was using less lethal chemical weapons that neutralize and are not fatal. The Israeli official only cited images of people hurt in the alleged attacks, but gave no indication that he had other evidence, such as soil samples, typically used to verify chemical weapons use. He made the remarks as US Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel wrapped up a three-day visit to Israel focused on the Syrian unrest and Iran's nuclear energy program. Israel has previously leveled similar accusations against Damascus without providing any evidence. Political observers believe Tel Aviv is trying to pave the way for a foreign intervention in Syria, which is part of an anti-Israeli front in the region, by accusing Damascus of using chemical weapons. The United States has described any use of chemical weapons in Syria as a 'red line,' which would evoke possible military action. This is while Western countries, including US, have remained silent over militants' use of chemical weapons in Aleppo in March, which killed 25 people. Damascus has repeatedly said that it will not chemical weapons against its own people.

Mahmudur Rahman was arrested in a raid on the office of the Bengali-language Amar Desh newspaper in Dhaka on Thursday. Security officials would not immediately say what charges would be brought against him. The Ekattor TV station said the editor would face eight charges, including sedition and cybercrime. Police told local media that Rahman would appear before a Dhaka court later on Thursday. Leaders of the government’s ruling party have accused the daily of inciting violence during recent political unrest. Amar Desh is the leading opposition paper in the country. Its circulation and online audience have increased significantly due to recent investigative reports and its anti-government stand. Human rights groups have accused the ruling Awami League party of harassment of Rahman and his paper. Government officials filed charges including defamation and sedition against him in 2009, 2010 and 2012.

"Armed men storm Libyan Foreign Ministry - UPI.com Top News U.S. News World News Featured Odd News Entertainment Movies Music TV Science Health Sports NFL MLB NBA Soccer Voices Photos News US News World News Entertainment Sports Archive Almanac Advertisement Special Reports April 30, 2013 / 9:11 AM Libyan ministry stormed by armed men TRIPOLI, Libya, April 30 (UPI) -- The Libyan people are called on to rally around their government in the face of internal acts of sabotage, Libyan Prime Minister Ali Zeidan said Tuesday. Armed men stormed the building housing the Libyan Foreign Ministry, calling for a moratorium on the hiring of officials from the regime of Moammar Gadhafi , who died during the 2011 civil war. Advertisement Libyan security has lapsed in the wake of the war. The French Embassy in Tripoli was bombed last week and foreign governments have warned of the security risks in most major metropolitan areas of the country. The U.N. Security Council issued a statement saying attacks on diplomatic interests could ""seriously impede"" the work of the international community in Libya. An attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya, last year resulted in the death of U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens and three members of his staff. Zeidan said Tuesday that Libyans should rally around the central government, which is struggling against ""people who want to destabilize the country,"" the BBC reports. The BBC reports that about 20 vehicles carrying men armed with assault rifles blocked most of the major roads leading to Tripoli. The BBC reports the militia is unorganized, however.

A dealer/retailer cannot shy away from responsibility when it comes to defective goods Updated - April 28, 2013 07:27 pm IST S. SAROJA Copy link Email Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit READ LATER Remove SEE ALL PRINT When we buy a product and it turns out to be defective, we immediately take it to the dealer/retailer expecting a quick apology and a replacement or refund. Unfortunately, more often than not, it turns out to be a tormenting experience as the dealer turns defensive and refuses to own up responsibility. He will either blame us stating that we had deliberately damaged the product or will pass the buck on to the manufacturer stating that the responsibility for the defect rests solely with the manufacturer. Sunil was one such affected person. Recently, he purchased a mobile phone from a dealer and within a day of purchase there were problems. Despite charging, the charge did not hold for long and the display went blank. Sunil approached the retailer at once and asked for a replacement. This request was refused point blank but, the dealer took the phone and agreed to get it repaired. Sunil trusted him and handed over the phone. After a week, the instrument was returned after repairs. Nevertheless, to his dismay, the same issues continued from the very next day. Sunil went to the dealer again and demanded a replacement. Even so, the retailer did not entertain this and asked Sunil to approach the manufacturer for further action. The manufacturer failed to respond and a disconcerted Sunil is likely to file his complaint against the dealer and the manufacturer, before the Consumer Forum. The Consumer Fora has, in many cases, held that retailers cannot shy away from taking responsibility of defective goods which they had sold. The dealer, along with the manufacturer, is equally liable for poor quality goods and therefore, an aggrieved consumer can hold both of them liable and may claim compensation from either of them. In the case of M. Subba Reddy vs Avula Venkata Reddy that came up before the National Commission, the decision of the District Forum and State Commission, ordering compensation of Rs.7500/- for sale of defective seeds was challenged. The counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant claimed that the appellant was a dealer and was consequently not personally liable for the defective seeds and therefore, order ought not to have been passed against him without including the manufacturer as a party. The Commission held that though it would have been appropriate to include the manufacturer, since the dealer had sold the seeds to the complainant, the complaint was certainly maintainable and added that if the appellant had any grievance, it was open to him to recover the amount ordered from the manufacturer. Similarly, in the case of Harmohinder Singh vs. Anil Sehgal, the complainant purchased an assembled air-conditioner from the opposite party. Soon after, the compressor became defective. The District Forum concluded that since the compressor was not manufactured by the opposite party, he could not be held responsible for its manufacturing defects and thus dismissed the complaint. The complainant preferred an appeal before the State Commission, wherein, the Commission held that a dealer cannot avoid his liability simply on the ground that he was not a manufacturer. It is his responsibility to carry out the terms of the warranty and in turn, he may involve the manufacturer in fulfilling his obligations under warranty. This was upheld by the National Commission. Thus, it is important for the dealers/retailers not to shirk responsibility but to be more upbeat so that the consumers’ confidence in the product and the company increases.

My Account Sign In Sign Out Home :: Security :: Library :: News :: 2013 :: April :: Military WMD Intelligence Security Menu Systems Industry Operations Hot Documents News Reports Policy Budget Congress Links Space Homeland Security Chinese military cyberattacks targeting civil sectors: report ROC Central News Agency 2013/04/27 18:43:16 Taipei, April 27 (CNA) The National Security Bureau (NSB) believes that the Chinese military has shifted the emphasis of cyberattacks on Taiwan from government institutions to civilian think tanks, telecommunications service providers, Internet node facilities and traffic signal control systems, according to an NSB report. The report on Taiwan's measures to stem attacks by China's Internet army and hackers was prepared for lawmakers' reference ahead of a planned legislative hearing on the issue on April 29 that will be attended by NSB, Ministry of National Defense, and Criminal Investigation Bureau officials. In the report, the NSB said Chinese hackers are trying to break Taiwan's defense mechanisms by engaging in massive 'social engineering' practices (which fool people into divulging confidential information or giving access to their computers) on key persons in targeted organizations. Their goal is to acquire as much control as possible over the unit's internal Internet system before moving to steal or forge information, or paralyze Internet communication. The bureau said the Chinese military has shifted its targets from government institutions and overseas consulates to civil sectors, including private think tanks, telecommunication service providers and contract businesses. The attacks are also targeting Internet node facilities with loose protection shields, traffic signal control systems, broadband routers, industrial micro-computer controllers and network-attached storage systems. In the future, the attacks may turn to Taiwan's key infrastructure facilities and individuals, the NSB warned, saying that through their cyber infiltration, hackers could collect information such as political party plans, economic and trade analysis reports, academic works and data on key infrastructure facilities and systems. According to NSB statistics, its external websites were hit by hackers 3.34 million times in 2012, most of which were scouting moves that increased Internet flows instead of actual attacks. There were over 70,000 malicious hacking attempts last year but they were all successfully blocked, the bureau said. The NSB suggested a number of measures to improve Internet security, including reinforcing the protection of key telecommunications infrastructure facilities, integrating government resources related to cyber security, and expanding Internet intelligence collection networks, according to the report.

"Seattle Police: Fake Nurse Entered Hospital Rooms to Steal Pain Medication - ABC News ABC News Video Live Shows Elections 538 Shop Stream on Seattle Police: Fake Nurse Entered Hospital Rooms to Steal Pain Medication Woman Posing As Nurse Stole Pain Medication, Police Say By ABC News April 24, 2013, 2:46 PM NaN:NaN April 24, 2013&#151; -- Dressed in slacks, a blue blouse and fluent in medical terminology, an unidentified woman walked into the rooms of two patients at the Swedish Medical Center, posing as a nurse. She then cut the tubes connecting them to their pain medications, according to the Seattle Police Department. The nurse impostor, who police say walked confidently into the patients' rooms without arousing suspicion, is still at large. READ: Florida Teen Allegedly Caught Impersonating Physician's Assistant Blames Hospital On April 13, police said the suspect entered a patient's room as he slept and tampered with his patient-administered pain medication machine. When the man awoke and asked the suspect what she was doing, she told him she would get his nurse, the police report said. ""When his nurse did come in, she found that the line from the machine to the witness had been cut and that the pain medication was dripping on the floor,"" the police report said. Shortly after the first incident, police said a second report came in that the suspect was seen peeking into rooms on another floor and had entered the room of a second patient, whose family was visiting. When an alarm sounded at the hospital, police said the suspect fled. A family member from the second patient's room reported there was blood on the floor and that the line to her mother's pain medication had been cut, police said. The phony nurse walked out of the hospital undetected with two feet of tubing in tow, security told police. A nurse advised police that a negligible amount of pain mediation would have been inside the tuning, police said. Swedish Medical Center notified police four days after the breach, said Det. Mark Jamieson. He said it was unclear why the hospital waited to notify authorities. ""It's possible there is surveillance video. Our detectives are working with the hospital,"" he said. Ed Boyle, spokesman for the hospital, said an internal investigation has been launched into the incident. ""Swedish is and has been working closely with Seattle Police over the course of the last week in hopes of identifying the suspect and preventing any further incidents at Swedish or any other area hospitals,"" he said in a statement. ""Although a delay in reporting the incident to Seattle Police occurred, Swedish security staff continued to investigate the incident."" The suspect is described as a white female in her mid-30s to early 40s with blonde hair that is either shoulder length or pulled back into a pony tail.

We need people who can help us sustain the positive economic climate that we are having. We know that the backbone of our economy is the MSMEs, but aside from their innate entrepreneurial mindset, they will need a legislator who can push for laws that will make success easier for them to attain. I came across Sonny Angara during our Technopreneur summit last January, and I really find his track record quite impressive. As he runs for a higher position this coming elections, I asked him what is in store for the micro, small, and medium negosyantes should he get elected. Let me share with you his answers. Entrepreneurship creates jobs. Do you think this is a very good alternative to the OFW phenomenon? Yes, definitely. The main reason why our OFWs have to go to other countries is to look for jobs that they cannot find here. Thus, if we can create the needed jobs through successful business ventures, there will be no  necessity for our OFWs to seek employment abroad. Having more entrepreneurs that employ our workforce would mean lesser Filipinos having to leave the country and their families. What are your platforms to support job generation through entrepreneurship? To generate decent jobs, I have been pushing for economic and investment policies that promote growth and development of the economy since I became a legislator. To date, I have principally authored at least seven laws that are aimed at improving the countryâ€™s business climate. One such law which has a direct impact on our entrepreneurs is RA 9510 or the Credit Information System Act which aims to broaden access to credit, especially to small borrowers (particularly MSMEs), by reducing reliance on collateral and thru lower credit costs. Given the chance, I will continue to push for similar measures that aim to develop and help establish budding entrepreneurs. One of these is to work for the enactment of my bill which seeks to establish a Business One-Stop Shop (BOSS) centers that will cater to the needs of small and medium enterprises, from their registration up to their operations, and provide supplementary services such as information and linkages, project monitoring, research and policy studies, and information dissemination campaigns. Moreover, given the economic profile of most Filipino families, it is imperative that government supports the growth of more public tech-vocational schools that will provide immediate employable skills, as well as knowledge and training in establishing a new business. To this end, I will push for the enactment of my bill requiring all provinces and highly-urbanized cities to establish tech-vocational and skills training schools. I will also push for the inclusion of entrepreneurship as a separate subject at the high school level in all public and private schools. Entrepreneurship is envisioned to encourage students to be job creators instead of job seekers. Another policy that I aim to put in place is the provision of incentives to new graduates who want to venture into business after graduation. The key to the growth of entrepreneurship is the expanding network of enterprises it generates. How do you think the government can help Go Negosyo, or other entrepreneur-friendly NGOs, champion the success formula of entrepreneurship further? I will lay down policies that will support networks of entrepreneurs or businesses. I believe that we must have a program that assists our LGUs and local business networks in setting up mechanisms that create a conducive environment for economic growth. I would propose a measure that will mandate government agencies with special concern on employment, such as but not limited, to the Department of Labor and Employment, Cooperative Development Authority, Department of Trade and Industry, Department of Interior and Local Government, Department of Agriculture, Bureau of Internal Revenue, and National Anti-Poverty Commission, to draw and adopt sustainable programs for the empowerment of various associations of entrepreneurs. These agencies will also be tasked to provides technical support to networks of entrepreneurs as well as expand credit facilities to them. Moreover, the Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (TESDA) provides training and certification to networks of entrepreneurs to enable them to upgrade their membersâ€™ entrepreneurial and occupational capacity. What do you think are the changes that we need to adopt to make our education more oriented towards promoting entrepreneurship?â€¨ Our youth should be made aware of the vast opportunities and benefits of being an entrepreneur, and of having a business of their own. Thus, entrepreneurial education should be made an integral part of our basic education. Our students should know that entrepreneurship is a good alternative to employment. They should be equipped with the necessary information and competencies about the subject. To this end, I filed HB 559 that mandates DepEd to make entrepreneurial and financial literacy education an integral part of secondary education, to raise generations of businessmen and investors who will create jobs not only for themselves but for others as well. One of the things that hamper the growth of entrepreneurship is corruption and red tape in the local government levels. How do you think we can solve this problem?â€¨ Red tape is killing us in so many waysâ€”it discourages people from being entrepreneurs because they donâ€™t want to deal with the government, and it discourages investors who prefer to do business in friendlier jurisdictions. The Anti-Red Tape Act or RA 9485 was enacted in 2007 as a response to the urgent need to establish an effective system that will eliminate bureaucratic red tape, avert graft and corrupt practices and improve efficiency of delivering government frontline service. The law mandates all national departments and agencies, as well as local government units (LGUs) to simplify procedures and establish citizenâ€™s charters that will provide clear service standards governing transactions. In 2010, it was reported that 74 percent of the national agencies came out with their respective ctizenâ€™s charters. As a senator, I aim to provide good oversight on this matter. If need be, the act must be strengthened and LGUs provided with the needed resources, training and education. Out of 183 economies surveyed, the Philippines ranked 136 in the Ease of Doing Business Report of the World Bank for 2012, falling two notches lower than its rank of 134 during the previous year. To start a business in the country, one has to go through an average of 15 steps and wait for 35 days (World Bank 2012). Given this, I have proposed HB 416 or the Business One-Stop Shop (BOSS) that aims to establish centers that will cater to the needs of small and medium enterprises, from their registration up to their operations, as well as provide supplementary services, such as information and referrals needed for a firm, project monitoring research and policy studies and information dissemination campaigns. It aims to simplify procedures and create one-stop shops for service provision by government. * * * Contact [email protected] .

AMRITSAR : It was like a reincarnation for 46-year-old Ram Kumar when someone of his own blood embraced him and took him to his native village after 21 years of disappearance. Ram Kumar was one among the 19 Indian nationals repatriated by Pakistan on August 14, 2007, after completion of their jail terms. Since most of them were mentally challenged and did not remember their addresses, they were admitted in Amritsar's Institute of Mental Health for treatment. It was believed that Ram Kumar and others were subjected to physical and mental torture by Pakistan police as well as jail authorities. ""I am lucky to be back with my family and want to forget my past"" said Ram Kumar, before leaving for his village Chodakpura in Hardoi district of Uttar Pradesh. He said he had spent only one year in Pakistan, but did not exactly remember how he had reached there. His handicapped nephew Satish -- who had arrived at Amritsar along with a couple of friends to receive his uncle -- said that his father Shiv Kumar, brother of Ram Kumar, used to tell him about his uncle and encouraged him to trace him after his disappearance. ""We looked for him in almost all the cities of UP, including Lucknow, Farookhabad and Kanpur, but all in vain,"" he said. When a week ago, the family of Ram Kumar received a letter from the police department, they were surprised to know that he (Ram) was alive and in Amritsar. But they were not ready to believe that he was sentenced in Pakistan. ""My father told me that Ram Kumar was in the company of some sadhus. He used to take charas and had disappeared. I was just two years old then,"" said Satish. ""With treatment, he is now healthy and remembers his past, but we had a tough time finding his family in India,"" said Dr BL Goyal, Director, Institute of Mental Health. He said when Ram Kumar gained some memory, he gave hints of his address, following which they wrote to the Resident Commissioner of Uttar Pradesh in Delhi to trace Ram Kumar's relatives. ""Finally, his nephew arrived to take him home."" There were 13 more persons repatriated along with Ram Kumar from Pakistan, but their relatives are still untraceable.

"Big brands, retailers reject union safety plan as Bangladesh death toll rises | CTV News Home FOLLOW ON Advertisement WORLD Big brands, retailers reject union safety plan as Bangladesh death toll rises Kay Johnson And Julhas Alam The Associated Press Published Friday, April 26, 2013 11:39AM EDT Last Updated Friday, April 26, 2013 9:53PM EDT Share: Reddit Share Text: DHAKA, Bangladesh -- As Bangladesh reels from the deaths of hundreds of garment workers in a building collapse, the refusal of global retailers to pay for strict nationwide factory inspections is bringing renewed scrutiny to an industry that has profited from a country notorious for its hazardous workplaces and subsistence-level wages. After a factory fire killed 112 garment workers in November, clothing brands and retailers continued to reject a union-sponsored proposal to improve safety throughout Bangladesh's $20 billion garment industry. Instead, companies expanded a patchwork system of private audits and training that labour groups say improves very little in a country where official inspections are lax and factory owners have close relations with the government. In the meantime, threats to workers persist. In the five months since last year's deadly blaze at Tazreen Fashions Ltd., there were 41 other ""fire incidents"" in Bangladesh factories -- ranging from a deadly blaze to smaller fires or sparks that caused employees to panic, according to a labour organization affiliated with the AFL-CIO umbrella group of American unions. Combined, the recent incidents killed nine workers and injured more than 660, some with burns and smoke inhalation and others with injuries from stampedes while fleeing. Wednesday's collapse of the Rana Plaza building that killed more than 300 people is the worst disaster to hit Bangladesh's fast-growing and politically powerful garment industry. For those attempting to overhaul conditions for workers who are paid as little as $38 a month, it is a grim reminder that corporate social responsibility programs are failing to deliver on lofty promises. More than 48 hours after the eight-story building collapsed, some garment workers were still trapped alive Friday, pinned beneath tons of mangled metal and concrete. Rescue crews struggled to save them, knowing they probably had just a few hours left to live, as desperate relatives clashed with police. ""Improvement is not happening,"" said Amirul Haque Amin, president of the National Garment Workers Federation in Bangladesh, who said a total of 600 workers have died in factory accidents in the last decade. ""The multinational companies claim a lot of things. They claim they have very good policies, they have their own code of conduct, they have their auditing and monitoring system,"" Amin said. ""But yet these things keep happening."" What role retailers should play in making working conditions safer at the factories that manufacture their apparel has become a central issue for the $1 trillion global clothing industry. The clothing brands say they are working to improve safety, but the size of the garment industry -- some 4,000 factories in Bangladesh alone --means such efforts skim the surface. That opaqueness is further muddied by subcontracting. Retailers can be unwittingly involved with problematic factories when their main suppliers farm out work to others to ensure orders are filled on time. ""We remain committed to promoting stronger safety measures in factories and that work continues,"" Wal-Mart said in a statement after the Rana Plaza collapse. The world's largest retailer says there was no authorized Wal-Mart production in the building. One of the Rana Plaza factories, Ether Tex, listed Wal-Mart as a customer on its website. Labour groups argue the best way to clean up Bangladesh's garment factories already is outlined in a nine-page safety proposal drawn up by Bangladeshi and international unions. The plan would ditch government inspections, which are infrequent and easily subverted by corruption, and establish an independent inspectorate to oversee all factories in Bangladesh, with powers to shut down unsafe facilities as part of a legally binding contract signed by suppliers, customers and unions. The inspections would be funded by contributions from the companies of up to $500,000 per year. The proposal was presented at a 2011 meeting in Dhaka attended by more than a dozen of the world's largest clothing brands and retailers -- including Wal-Mart, Gap and Swedish clothing giant H&M -- but was rejected by the companies because it would be legally binding and costly. At the time, Wal-Mart's representative told the meeting it was ""not financially feasible ... to make such investments,"" according to minutes of the meeting obtained by The Associated Press. After last year's Tazreen blaze, Bangladeshi union president Amin said he and international labour activists renewed a push for the independent inspectorate plan, but none of the factories or big brands would agree. Siddiqur Rahman, former vice-president of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association, denied the factories are responsible for killing the plan, saying the problem was that buyers did not want to pay for it. ""We welcome anything that is good for the garment industry and its workers here,"" Rahman said. He also disputed several union groups' figures of dozens of factory fires since November, saying there had been only one. The Solidarity Center, the non-profit group affiliated with the AFL-CIO, said its staff in Bangladesh compiled the list of 41 ""fire incidents"" from local media and counted any incident that caused injury or evacuation as an indication of compromised safety. This week, none of the large clothing brands or retailers would comment about the proposal. Wal-Mart spokesman Kevin Gardner did not directly answer questions about the unions' safety plans in replies to questions emailed by The Associated Press. H&M responded to questions with emailed links to corporate social responsibility websites. In December, however, a spokesperson for the Gap -- which owns the Gap, Old Navy and Banana Republic chains -- said the company turned down the proposal because it did not want to be vulnerable to lawsuits and did not want to pay factories more money to help with safety upgrades. H&M also did not sign on to the proposal because it believes factories and local government in Bangladesh should be taking on the responsibility, Pierre B÷rjesson, manager of sustainability and social issues, told AP in December. H&M, which places the most apparel orders in Bangladesh and works with more than 200 factories there, is one of about 20 retailers and brands that have banded together to develop training films for garment manufacturers. Wal-Mart last year began requiring regular audits of factories, fire drills and mandated fire safety training for all levels of factory management. It also announced in January it would immediately cut ties with any factory that failed an inspection, instead of giving warnings first as before. And the Gap has hired its own chief fire inspector to oversee factories that produce its clothing in Bangladesh. But many insist such measures are not enough to overhaul an industry that employs 3 million workers. ""No matter how much training you have, you can't walk through flames or escape a collapsed building,"" said Ineke Zeldenrust of the Amsterdam-based Clean Clothes Campaign, which lobbies for garment workers' rights. Private audits also have their failings, she said. Because audits are confidential, even if one company pulls its business from a supplier over safety issues, it won't tell its competitors, who will continue to place orders -- allowing the unsafe factory to stay open. The Tazreen factory that burned last year had passed inspections, and two of the factories in the Rana Plaza building had passed the standards of a major European group that does factory inspections in developing countries. The Business Social Compliance Initiative, which represents hundreds of companies, said the factories of Phantom Apparels and New Wave Style had been audited against its code of conduct which it said focuses on labour issues, not building standards. ""The audits and inspections are too much focused on checklists,"" said Saif Khan, who worked for Phillips Van Heusen, the owner of brands Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein, in Bangladesh until 2011 as a factory compliance supervisor. ""They touch on broader areas but do not consider the realities on the ground,"" he said. Johnson reported from Mumbai, India. AP reporter Farid Hossain contributed from Bangladesh.

"DPRK's New Strategic Line Is Not Diplomatic Tactic: Rodong Sinmun Subscribe Now ! My Account Sign In Sign Out Home :: WMD :: Library :: News :: North Korea :: 2013 :: April :: Military WMD Menu Introduction Systems Facilities Agencies Operations Countries Hot Documents News Reports Policy Budget Congress Links Intelligence Homeland Security Space Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) DPRK's New Strategic Line Is Not Diplomatic Tactic: Rodong Sinmun Korean Central News Agency of DPRK via Korea News Service (KNS) Pyongyang, April 29 (KCNA) -- The new strategic line on simultaneously pushing forward economic construction and the building of nuclear force is not a temporary stop-gap measure for coping with the ever-changing situation but a strategic one to be always held fast to meet the supreme interests of the Korean revolution, says Rodong Sinmun Monday in a bylined article. The DPRK has not had access to nuclear weapons to get recognition from others and the strategic line on pushing forward the up-building of economy and nuclear force has nothing to do with the diplomatic tactic for sitting at a negotiating table, the article says, and goes on: We have never looked for anything from the hostile forces nor have begged for peace. We have no idea to have dialogue with the U.S. unless it renounces its hostile policy toward the DPRK. Accustomed to making a cheap bargaining, the U.S. seems to calculate that the DPRK hopes for it, too. Washington would be well advised not to misjudge it. Such rhetoric as ""diplomatic tactic"" and ""negotiating table"" that were made as regards the new strategic line is nothing but a product of a bargaining made by the U.S. and its followers to deprive the DPRK of its sovereign right. The U.S. claims that it will give help if we choose other way. This may work on other countries but never on the DPRK. The nuclear weapons of Songun Korea are by no means goods for getting the U.S. dollars nor a political and economic bargaining chip to be put on a negotiating table aimed to force the DPRK to disarm itself. The present ruling forces of the U.S. should draw a due lesson from the failure of its successive chief executives in its hostile policy toward the DPRK and properly approach it.

Elections officials say there are weaknesses in voter registration and voter awareness. There are also wide discrepancies in the funds for various political parties, China's official Xinhua news agency reports. Advertisement General elections in 2010 were heralded as a democratic breakthrough for a country run formerly by a military council. Pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi was freed from house arrest that year and secured a seat on Myanmar's Parliament in 2012 elections. The U.S. and European governments have eased sanctions on Myanmar in response to political reforms. Human rights groups expressed concern, however, saying it was those sanctions that have encouraged reforms. Myanmar officials attending a rights ceremony hosted by the International Crisis Group suggested election laws would be amended to allow Suu Kyi to run for president. Party officials later told Thai newspaper The Irrawaddy there were no such plans, however. Advertisement Suu Kyi is ineligible to run for president because she has children with a foreign national. She won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991 for her pro-democracy campaign.

Media requires JavaScript to play. 22 April 2013 Last updated at 13:47 Help The Assembly passed a motion calling for an end to an exception to fair employment law ""allowing discrimination on the grounds of religious belief when appointing teachers"", on 22 April 2013. The UUP's Danny Kinahan said the teachers' exception was ""an inequality which should have been addressed years ago"". He explained the requirement of the CCMS (Council for Catholic Maintained Schools) that in order to apply for jobs in its primary schools teachers must hold a recognised religious certificate. Mr Kinahan said that writing the exception into EU law in 2000 ""was an exercise in deception"" ""It is clear that this whole area is in desperate need of reform,"" he said. Mervyn Storey of the DUP was in favour of the motion. He said it was ""absolutely and totally unacceptable that any organisation is allowed to discriminate in the way that this practice has been going on for the last 40 years"". Sinn Fein's Chris Hazzard also backed the motion. He noted the amendment of the CCMS policy to allow teachers to apply for jobs with the proviso that they obtain the Catholic certificate within three years. ""Any proposed repeal of the exception will not be a silver bullet some believe it to be,"" he concluded. The SDLP's education spokesman Sean Rogers, a former school principal, spoke against the motion. He said schools used the certificate to equip teachers ""with the ability to conduct religious education classes in a thorough manner against the background of a Christian ethos"". Mr Rogers added that  ""at primary level sacramental preparation is an important part of religious education"". Chris Lyttle supported the motion for the Alliance Party stating that ""our aim should be to train teachers in a shared and integrated environment "". The motion was carried on an oral vote.

AFP/Getty Images Story highlights Twitter signs major ad deal with Publicis' Starcom MediaVest Partnership is worth hundreds of millions of dollars and is Twitter's largest ad deal SMG clients include P&G, Walmart, Coca-Cola, gain ""preferred"" Twitter ad slots New York Financial Times — Twitter has taken a big step on to traditional media turf by signing its biggest advertising deal with one of the world’s leading ad-buyers, according to people familiar with the matter. The deal with Publicis’s Starcom MediaVest Group is worth hundreds of millions of dollars over several years and reflects both the growing importance of Twitter in media and marketing, and new thinking on its relationship with television. “We think that the industry had been focused in the wrong area, which was making a decision between Twitter and TV,” said Adam Bain, Twitter’s president of global revenue. “That’s not what we believe. Twitter is a bridge.” The deal, structured as a partnership, comes as people increasingly visit social networking sites and use mobile devices while watching television. A recent Nielsen study confirmed a strong correlation between increases in Twitter volume and TV ratings.

AFP PHOTO/Nicholas KAMM (Photo credit should read NICHOLAS KAMM/AFP/GettyImages) AFP/Getty Images video Related video Would you pay for fake Twitter followers? The arrangement grants SMG’s clients, which include Procter & Gamble, Walmart, Microsoft and Coca-Cola, access to preferred advertising slots on Twitter, research and data, and new products, such as an “In-tweet mobile survey” programme that will allow companies to poll consumers for real-time opinions. It comes only weeks before US television networks sell about three-quarters of their commercial inventory in the annual “up front” market and is likely to put pressure on TV companies to include more digital and social media offerings in their pitches. “Twitter, in a very short period of time, has gone from an experiment to something that is essential,” Laura Desmond, global chief executive of Starcom MediaVest Group, told the Financial Times. “This signals to the marketplace how we want to conduct business and measure the implications. This is the future. It’s convergence.” The deal is not exclusive and does not preclude Twitter from striking similar partnerships with other marketing companies. It comes as Twitter unveils a flurry of new advertising products and plans to work more closely with TV networks. While the spending marketers commit to Twitter remain a fraction of the $205bn they spend on television globally, budgets are shifting quickly.

"Bolivia’s Morales gets go-ahead for next year re-election bid | South China Morning Post Advertisement Americas and the Caribbean World Bolivia’s Morales gets go-ahead for next year re-election bid Reading Time: 1 minute Why you can trust SCMP Agence France-Presse in La Paz Published: 2:02pm, 30 Apr 2013 Updated: 12:58pm, 10 Oct 2017 Bolivia’s constitutional court ruled on Monday that President Evo Morales may seek re-election next year, an official said. Advertisement Constitutional court chair Ruddy Flores said the tribunal determined that Morales, the first indigenous president of South America’s poorest nation, could run for what would be his third straight term. Though only two consecutive terms are allowed under the constitution, Morales was found able to seek immediate re-election because his first term did not take place under the current constitution. Morales, a socialist and staunch US critic, was elected for his first term -- set for 2006 to 2011 -- in 2005. But, under a new constitution, his first term ended in 2009 with a new election, which he won. His current term, which began in 2010, runs to 2015. Advertisement Morales, 53, would get 41 per cent of the vote if the election were held today, according to a poll released last weekend. His closest rival, Samuel Doria Medina, would get 17 per cent.

Constitutional court chair Ruddy Flores said the tribunal determined that Morales could run for what would be his third term. It will be his last as the constitution allows only two terms for the president. The court’s decision was the culmination of a three-year legal battle over Morales’ eligibility to run again in the October 2014 presidential election. Morales has already said he will run again. The decision was a setback for Morales’ opponents, who have been pushing for him to step down and call new elections. Bolivia’s Congress has passed a law that would allow Morales to run for a third term, but the court had to rule on the law’s constitutionality.

Yadlin said that without ""a drastic change"" in the pressures on Iran, it will keep on ""buying time"" and widening its nuclear program. For Iran to sign an agreement, he said, there has to be a price for not doing so. Negotiations can succeed, he added, if the U.S. creates a credible military option. This will be achieved if the U.S. prepares for a surgical strike for stopping the nuclear program and makes clear that it will be able to deal with the escalation that will follow such a strike.""

Matters YOU US TNS Business State Bank facilitates banks By Our Correspondent March 17, 2020 KARACHI: The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has facilitated commercial banks by expediting claims against transactions services provided in collection of duty and taxes. In a circular issued on Monday, the central bank said that to promote digital payment of government taxes and duties, the central bank with effect from January 1, 2020, eliminated the transaction fee for taxpayers using digital modes for the payment of duties and taxes of federal and provincial governments. The banks were advised that the taxpayers would not be charged the transaction fee on alternate delivery channels (ADCs); rather such fees would be charged to and collected from the SBP on monthly basis at the prescribed rates. However, the claims from banks are arriving in bits and pieces; thereby, taking relatively longer processing time, the SBP said. To facilitate expeditious settlement of bank claims, it has been decided that instead of receiving claims from commercial banks individually, 1Link will lodge a consolidated monthly claim by giving breakup of amount owed to each bank, after reconciliation and verification of the transactions. The consolidated claim will be lodged by 1Link within two days after close of the month and the SBP would settle the claims within five working days, through Real-Time Gross Settlement. The credit intimation will be conveyed to banks through RTGS interface, the SBP added.

The second is the risk of a future legal challenge regarding his eligibility as a candidate. And the third is that he is yet to find a running mate - the person who would replace him if he happened to win a seat but couldn't turn up within two consecutive months, as required under the constitution. However, the WikiLeaks Party, which  declared it would field Senate candidates in three states -  Victoria, NSW and Western Australia - is confident of political success. Mr Assange is the only candidate announced so far, but campaign director Greg Barns says other ''high quality'' contenders will be secured within weeks, running on a platform of transparency and accountability. ''The focus of each campaign will be, of course, winning a Senate seat, and we certainly think we're in the mix in each of the three states,'' Mr Barns said. To secure a spot in the Senate, candidates will be required to gain about 14.3 per cent of the vote, and take up their position some time after July 1 next year. Asked if he was confident Mr Assange could take on the job if he were  elected, Mr Barns replied: ''It would be up to the government to secure the opportunity for Mr Assange to come back to Australia. ''The situation would be that you would have a person whom the voters of Victoria have elected and decided that they want to represent them in the Senate, and you would have an Australian government, which to date - along with the opposition - has not lifted a diplomatic or political finger to assist Mr Assange in preventing him from being extradited to the United States, where he would face almost certain torture.'' The WikiLeaks Party already has more than 500 members. Mr Barns, a former Howard government adviser and director of the Australian Republican Movement, will run the campaign. Mr Assange's father, John Shipton, will help build the party.

He was always together with Generalissimo Kim Jong Il in inspection tours of military units before he assumed the KPA supreme commandership. After he took over the supreme commandership, he has continued his military inspection to further strengthen the politico-ideological and military might of the revolutionary armed forces. In Juche 101 (2012) alone, he inspected air and anti-air units, naval and strategic rocket units and many other units in the wake of his inspection tour of the Seoul Ryu Kyong Su Guards 105th Tank Division in early January. During his inspection tours, he set forth Juche-oriented strategies and tactics, seeing to it that military training was ensured in such a way as to meet real wartime needs. When the situation of the Korean Peninsula was driven to the brink of war owing to the U.S.-south Korea joint military exercises Key Resolve and Foal Eagle, he made inspection tours of the Panmunjom military post, Cho and Ryo islets defence detachments and other frontline military posts in the eastern and western coastal areas one after another, thus emboldening the servicepersons. Now the KPA has turned into an elite army with Kim Jong Un's strategy and tactics and latest offensive and defensive means capable of defeating any formidable enemy. Visiting military units, Kim Jong Un would show deep loving care for soldiers. Such love was vividly evidenced by the fact that he posed for pictures with each of all company soldiers when visiting the Kamnamu (persimmon tree) post. His loving care and trust in servicepersons serve as the source of kinship between the supreme commander and his soldiers and the strength making all the servicepersons stalwart combatants.

The paper highlights that increased atmospheric carbon dioxide by itself, without any warming, can cause substantial changes in the Earth's atmosphere that directly affect where and how much rain falls. Geoengineering options which only look at cooling the planet will consequently not deal with significant unresolved climate affects brought about by climate change. “I doubt we will ever have a feasible geoengineering method to actually remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Now this research suggests that those geoengineering methods which aim to cool the Earth would not be as effective as we had hoped either,” Professor Steven Sherwood, one of the paper’s authors, said. “It highlights that we need to combat global warming by reducing our emissions at the source.” More related stories Mining & Energy Miners count cost of cyclone Rio Tinto is facing a slower return to exports following Cyclone Veronica, as resources giants assess its impact in WA.

Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina said in an exclusive interview with the BBC that sufficient laws are in place to punish people who insult any religion, not just those who defame Islam and Prophet Muhammad. Advertisement ""This country is a secular democracy. So each and every religion has the right to practice their religion freely and fair,"" she told the BBC. ""But it isn't fair to hurt anybody's religious feeling. Always we try to protect every religious sentiment."" Related Pakistani schools close to protest arson Pakistan Christians protest blasphemy riot Pakistani man killed by mob over blasphemy Cairo court sentences man to 3 years for defamation of religion Blasphemy laws, religious restriction link Her comments come as members of the religious group Hefajat-e Islam continue to march through the capital urging a nationwide shutdown of businesses and demanding tougher blasphemy laws including use of the death penalty. Among their demands is strict punishment of so-called atheist bloggers whom they blaspheme Islam and Prophet Muhammad, a report by the Daily News said. ""A new law will have to be formulated incorporating the provision of the punishment suggested in Islam,"" Noor Hossain Kashemi, leader of the Dhaka city branch of Hefajat, said. Advertisement Kashemi claimed that one member of Hefajat-e Islam was shot dead by police in Chittagong and more than 400 Hefajat men were injured across the country when attacked by members of the ruling Awami League party, in power since elections in January 2009. He also apologized for attacks by his members on two reporters and two cameramen -- one of them a woman. ""On behalf of our leaders we express regret to the journalists who were injured by our men mistakenly,"" Kashemi said. The Financial Express newspaper reported that Hefajat-e Islam said it will close down Dhaka May 5 if the government doesn't act upon the religious group's demands. During the BBC interview, the prime minister said her government would consider their demands but wouldn't make promises about fulfilling the group's wishes. ""We will go through all the demands and then we will see,"" Hasina said. ""If there is any reasonable one, we will fulfil it. If it isn't reasonable or isn't suitable for our country or society we won't accept it."" Hasina also defended the arrest of four bloggers last week on suspicion of harming religious sentiment through their work, saying the government ""can take any action"" to protect society. Advertisement Eight blog operators blacked out their websites in protest. The prime minister also rejected calls by the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party to restore a neutral interim caretaker administration to oversee parliamentary polls. The BNP said it will boycott an election because the process wouldn't be free and fair. ""If they don't participate in the election, as a political party they will lose their seats,"" Hasina told the BBC. The Financial Express newspaper reported that several members of BNP attended protest rallies on the weekend and told the crowd they had solidarity with the  program of Hefajat-e-Islam.

Now it looks like the mystery might be solved. Jacob Conway, a Democratic Party official, told a Louisville NPR station that Progress Kentucky, a liberal group with a history of tangling with McConnell , made the tape, without permission from the party: On Feb. 2, McConnell opened his campaign headquarters in the Watterson Office Park in Louisville and invited trusted GOP activists and select media outlets to an open house. The event lasted roughly two hours. Afterward, McConnell and several campaign advisors held a strategy session in an office meeting room. [Progress Kentucky Founders] Morrison and Reilly did not attend the open house, but they told Conway they arrived later and were able to hear the meeting from the hallway. “They were in the hallway after the, I guess after the celebration and hoopla ended, apparently these people broke for lunch and had a strategy meeting, which is, in every campaign I've been affiliated with, makes perfect sense,” says Conway. “One of them held the elevator, the other one did the recording and they left. That was what they told to me from them directly.” The meeting room door is next to the elevators on that floor. McConnell campaign manager Jesse Benton has told multiple media outlets the door was shut and locked on Feb. 2. But the door has a vent at the bottom and a large gap underneath. “Apparently the gentlemen overheard the conversation and decided to record it with a phone or recording device they had in their pocket. Could've been an iPhone, could've been a Flip camera or something like that,” Conway say. By Alex Halperin Alex Halperin is news editor at Salon. You can follow him on Twitter @alexhalperin .

PETALING JAYA: The Umno Youth today dismissed the opposition’s ‘Ubah’ slogan as a gimmick.
Umno Youth deputy chief Khairy Jamaluddin said the “change” tag had become a political buzzword among the opposition.
He said Umno had been changing its leadership since the party’s formation in 1946, and had also changed its policies on a number of occasions.
The change in the party’s leadership was led by its president, he added.
“If the change is in the leadership, then the change is in the policies and we are changing.
“I don’t think it’s a good idea to use the slogan. I don’t believe it’s good for Malaysia,” he told The Malaysian Insider.

AMRITSAR : It was like reincarnation of 46-year-old Ram Kumar when someone of his blood relation embraced him and took him to his native village after 21 years of disappearance. Ram Kumar was one among 19 Indian nationals who were repatriated by Pakistan on August 14, 2007, after completion of their jail terms. Since most of them were mentally-challenged and didn't remember their addresses, they were admitted in Amritsar's Institute of Mental Health for treatment. It was believed that Ram Kumar and others was subjected to physical and mental torture by Pakistan police as well as jail authorities. ""I am lucky to be back with my family and want to forget my past"" said Ram Kumar before leaving for his village Chodakpura in Hardoi district of Uttar Pardesh. He said he had spent only one year in Pakistan but didn't exactly remember as to how he had reached there. His handicapped nephew Satish who along with couple of his friends has arrived at Amritsar to receive his uncle said that his father Shiv Kumar, brother of Ram Kumar, used to tell him about his uncle and inspired him to trace him after his disappearance. ""We found him in almost all the cities of UP including Lucknow, Farookabadh, Kanpur etc. but all in vain"" said he. When a week before family of Ram Kumar received a letter from police department they were surprised to know that Ram Kumar alive and was in Amritsar. But they were not ready to believe that he was sentenced in Pakistan. ""My father told me that Ram Kumar was in company of some Sadhu's and used to take Charas and had disappeared in those days only, I was just two years old then"" said Satish. ""With treatment he is now healthy and remember his past but we had tough time finding his family in India "" said Director , Institute of Mental Health, Dr. BL Goyal. He said when Ram Kumar gained some memory he gave hints of his address following which they wrote to Resident Commissioner of Uttar Pardesh in Delhi to trace Ram Kumar's relatives and finally his nephew had arrived to take him back. But there are still 13 more persons who were repatriated along with Ram Kumar by Pakistan and their relatives are untraceable as yet.

The cable, dated February 2008, was drafted by David T. Hopper, then consul general at the US consulate in Chennai. Hopper quotes top police officials about other areas identified by Riazuddin before his arrest in Karnataka. According to Hopper, Raziuddin told the police that along with accomplices from the banned Students Islamic Movement of India (SIMI), he had identified sites across the country for a series of bomb blasts. And ""beaches in Goa frequented by foreigners"" were one of those specifically identified as targets, according to the diplomatic communique. Goa has been put on high alert since the 26/11 terror strikes in Mumbai, mainly because the state's beaches attract over 2.6 million tourists annually, of whom half a million are foreign nationals. The sizeable number of Israeli tourists to the state is another reason why security agencies believe Goa is on the terror radar. The Goa government has, however, consistently denied receiving any specific intelligence inputs of a potential terror strike. Among other targets on Raziuddin's list were the Andhra Pradesh Police headquarters, and Infosys campuses in Bangalore and Mangalore, says the confidential cable numbered 08CHENNAI55. Then Karnataka additional director general of police Shankar Bidari, superintendent of police of Davangare district in Karnataka Ravendra Prasad, and state home secretary Vatsala Watsa have been quoted in the cable. Hopper also said that the Karnataka Police had shared intelligence with US officials. ""Shankar Bidari, Karnataka's Additional Director General of Police for Law and Order, gave us on February 8 two reports on this case. The first is the arrest report, the second covers the interrogation of both suspects,"" Hopper said, adding that the documents helped them to create a ""bio-data"" of the suspects. Raziuddin's father, Mohammad Nasiruddin, a Muslim cleric from Hyderabad in Andhra Pradesh, had been arrested in 2004 by Gujarat Police for being part of the conspiracy to murder Gujarat home minister Hiren Pandya. The cable also says that Indian police believed that Nasiruddin had links to Pakistan's Inter Services Intelligence (ISI).

"Work at new AIT site on hold as dispute continues - Taipei Times Front Page Taiwan News Business Editorial & Opinion Sports World News Features Bilingual Pages Search Search All Front Page Taiwan News Business Editorial & Opinion Sports World News Features Bilingual Pages GO Home Taiwan News Tue, Apr 30, 2013 page3 Work at new AIT site on hold as dispute continues By Shih Hsiu-chuan  /  Staff reporter The American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) yesterday remained steadfast over what it said was a “contractual dispute” between a US company and three Taiwanese subcontractors engaged in building its new office compound in Taipei’s Neihu District (內湖), but said it would to continue to engage with the US general contractor to address the issue. Representatives of the subcontractors to US-based Weston Solutions yesterday presented a petition to the AIT seeking a provision of financial relief from the US Department of State because defaults by the general contractor had affected their revenues. Wei Chuan Arch Contracting Co, Cherng-Her Construction Co and Area Energy said Weston Solutions owed them more than NT$470 million (US$15.9 million) dating back to September 2011. Construction workers from three Taiwanese subcontractors engaged in building the American Institute in Taiwan’s (AIT) new compound in Taipei’s Neihu District protest outside the AIT’s office in Taipei’s Daan District yesterday. Photo: Chang Chia-ming, Taipei Times Gathering at the AIT’s Taipei office on Xinyi Road, about 100 workers, some of whom are owed more than two months’ wages, said that the institute is “duty-bound” to help resolve the issue. Workers wore overalls, reflective vests and helmets, despite work at the construction site having been suspended since late last month because of the payment dispute. “Give me my salary. I have to survive. The AIT, step forward,” the workers shouted, holding banners and “anti-bullying” placards. Area Energy vice general manager Chuang Kuo-chang (莊國昌) said that Weston Solutions has missed payments since July 2011, adding that the debts owed to the company have reached NT$230 million. Weston Solutions’ failure to pay has affected not only the firm’s 50 workers seconded to the AIT project in Neihu, but also the entire company, which has 400 staff, Chuang said. “Complicated by the fact that the banks always furl their umbrellas on rainy days, the company is now facing a cash squeeze,” he added. A Wei Chuan Arch employee said he has not been paid in two months. Wei Chuan Arch representative Tu Chung-jen (涂崇仁) said the firm hoped the US Department of State could provide it with at least half of the amount of debt to allow construction on the site to resume. Tu said about 160 workers hired by the subcontractors had quit, were laid off or have been put on unpaid leave, while companies have pulled machinery and equipment off site, forcing a complete work stoppage. AIT spokesperson Mark Zimmer received the petition letter. Tu told Zimmer that they were appealing to the AIT for help over the “unfair treatment” they have endured so that justice can be done. Later, in a telephone interview with reporters, Zimmer said that the AIT would convey the letter to the appropriate authorities in Washington. “The AIT is extremely concerned by the matter and is aware of the firms’ frustrations,” he said. The US Department of State’s Bureau of Overseas Buildings Operations has been in contact with Weston Solutions to tell them that they need to adhere to their contract and fulfill obligations to Taiwanese subcontractors, he said. Asked to respond to the request for financial relief, Zimmer declined to comment on the “hypothetical scenario.” “At this point, we are looking at the best way to handle it [the dispute], but in the meantime, it’s still a dispute with Weston. I cannot speak about hypothetical solutions at this point,” he said. Zimmer did not provide a timeline to assess the subcontractors’ request and reiterated that the issue, at this time, “is still a contract dispute.” “At the same time, we are engaging with Weston Solutions and hoping that there will be a solution in the near future,” he said.

"Critical Infrastructure Protections Include Employee Information Subscribe Now ! My Account Sign In Sign Out Home :: Security :: Library :: News :: 2013 :: April :: Military WMD Intelligence Security Menu Systems Industry Operations Hot Documents News Reports Policy Budget Congress Links Space Homeland Security Critical Infrastructure Protections Include Employee Information By Claudette Roulo American Forces Press Service WASHINGTON, April 22, 2013 – President Barack Obama's February executive order requiring federal agencies to improve cybersecurity protections for critical infrastructure means the Defense Department will be sharing more information with the defense industrial base, Michael E. Reheuser, the director of DOD's Privacy and Civil Liberties Office, said April 19. ""The cyber threat to critical infrastructure continues to grow and represents one of the most serious national security challenges we must confront,"" the president wrote in his order. ""The national and economic security of the United States depends on the reliable functioning of the nation's critical infrastructure in the face of such threats."" The information sharing is intended to safeguard vital defense information shared with or held by the defense industrial base, Reheuser said in an interview with American Forces Press Service and the Pentagon Channel. ""The way we do that is provide them information that they can use ... to prevent persistent attacks that have been levied on almost every business in the United States,"" he said. In the past, that information wasn't always freely shared, Reheuser said. ""So, the president's executive order is encouraging DOD and other agencies to share that information with the companies so that they can better protect their information,"" he explained, ""so the nation as a whole won't be subject to as many attacks and the scope of the attacks won't be as significant."" According to the executive order, critical infrastructure includes systems and assets so vital to the United States that their failure or destruction would have a debilitating impact on security, national economic security, national public health or safety. The Defense Privacy and Civil Liberties Office is responsible for making sure that these information-sharing programs take into account the privacy and civil liberties of DOD employees and defense contractors, Reheuser said. ""So, for example, we want to make sure that we're not having any government monitoring of emails of personnel that don't work for the Department of Defense,"" he explained. Not only do DOD employees sign user agreements when they receive an email account, Reheuser noted, but each time they sign on, a banner explains their rights as a user of a defense information system. 'We [DOD employees] understand that our emails and other information on the computer -- because it's a government system -- can be monitored, and that monitoring consists of ensuring, for example, that classified information does not leave the network,' Reheuser said. While those rules apply to DOD employees, he said, the government does not monitor the systems of defense contractors. ""And under no program is that going on,"" he added. The DPCLO will assess the DOD's information-sharing programs to ensure that privacy and civil liberties protections exist and are fair, Reheuser said. That assessment will be delivered to the president next year as part of a joint report with the Department of Homeland Security, he added.

Impersonator Osvaldo Quiroz-Lopez could use a real publicist, too. Local media are all over his crumbling Cookie — the New York Post front page screams ""Crooky Monster;"" the Daily News went with ""Tough Cookie"" — who was arraigned Monday on charges of reckless endangerment and endangering the welfare of a child. The incident began when Sagar and Parmita Kurada and their son, Samay, headed to Toys R Us on Sunday for a bit of shopping. The area is a hotbed for puppet impersonators, with no actual connection to the store or Sesame Street, offering to pose for photos and hoping to collect tips. Parmita Kurada, whose stage name in India is Parmita Katkar, told the Post she was walking with Samay and her 8-month-old son, Swhaas, when they were swarmed by the impersonators. ""I just thought they were being friendly,"" she said. ""It's strange. We weren't even talking to them. These guys walk up to you and say, 'Take a picture! Take a picture!' "" She told the Post she took photos of Samay with several characters, but the Cookie Monster character became verbally abusive and pushed Samay. Her husband, Sagar, called police who arrested Quiroz-Lopez. He ""was right next to me saying, 'Come on, come on! Give me the money!' "" Kurada told the Daily News . ""I was getting scared. I thought he was going to attack me or he was going to hit me."" The criminal complaint alleges that when Quiroz-Lopez demanded $2, but Kurada said she didn't have any cash. ""You are a bitch, your son is a bastard and your stuff is trash,"" responded Quiroz-Lopez, 33, according to the court papers. ""She then observed the defendant place his hands on her son and push him, causing her son to lose his balance and nearly fall to the ground,'' the complaint says. So much for little Samay's love affair with Sesame Street characters. ""All he keeps saying is, 'I don't like the Cookie Monster, I don't like the Cookie Monster,'"" Kurada told the Post . Quiroz-Lopez's boyfriend said Kurada's story can't be accurate. ""I've lived with him for seven years,"" the man , who didn't give his name, told the Post . ""He's not that guy."" The Post notes that Times Square's costumed characters have become a ""scourge."" ""Everybody's concerned about this, and they're trying to find a thoughtful way to respond that respects free speech and addresses real concerns about public safety,'' said Tim Tompkins, president of the Times Square Alliance.

(AP) — Four children have died in a fire that swept through a mobile home Wednesday near the South Carolina city of Hartsville, their bodies discovered by firefighters shortly after they put out the flames, an official said. Russell Cox, a spokesman for the city of Hartsville, said firefighters took about 10 minutes to extinguish the fire and then found the victims in the charred interior of the home. The ages and identities of the victims were not immediately released by a local coroner, Cox added. ""There is a whole lot of crying here. It's an emotional scene,"" Cox told The Associated Press without elaborating. A photograph tweeted by the Darlington County sheriff 's office showed the charred interior of the mobile home while the outside appeared to be relatively undamaged. A tricycle and another children's toy could be seen in the yard. Smoke could be seen still wafting from an open front door where fire hoses snaked through the opening. The fire broke out on a street lined with mobile homes near Hartsville, a city of about 8,000 people about 60 miles east of the state capital of Columbia.

Facebook Twitter Instagram RSS Email Robots Humans show empathy for robots By LiveScience Published April 23, 2013 12:15pm EDT | Updated October 21, 2015 5:42am EDT Facebook Twitter Flipboard Print Email In new research, volunteers showed empathy while watching videos of a small dinosaur robot being treated violently. (Astrid Rosenthal-von der Pütten) From R2-D2 in ""Star Wars"" to Furby, robots can generate surprisingly humanlike feelings. Watching a robot being abused or cuddled has a similar effect on people to seeing those things done to a human, new research shows. Humans are increasingly exposed to robots in their daily lives, but little is known about how these lifelike machines influence human emotions. Feeling bad for bots In two new studies, researchers sought to measure how people responded to robots on an emotional and neurological level. In the first study, volunteers were shown videos of a small dinosaur robot being treated affectionately or violently. In the affectionate video, humans hugged and tickled the robot, and in the violent video, they hit or dropped him. [ 5 Reasons to Fear Robots ] Scientists assessed people's levels of physiological excitation after watching the videos by recording their skin conductance, a measure of how well the skin conducts electricity. When a person is experiencing strong emotions, they sweat more, increasing skin conductance. [pullquote] More On This... Ancient Europeans mysteriously vanished 4,500 years ago The volunteers reported feeling more negative emotions while watching the robot being abused. Meanwhile, the volunteers' skin conductance levels increased, showing they were more distressed. In the second study, researchers use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to visualize brain activity in the participants as they watched videos of humans and robots interacting. Again, participants were shown videos of a human, a robot, and, this time, an inanimate object being treated with affection or abuse. In one video, for example, a man appears to beat up a woman, strangle her with a string and attempt to suffocate her with a plastic bag. In another, a person does the same things to the robot dinosaur. Affectionate treatment of the robot and the human led to similar patterns of neural activity in regions in the brain's limbic system , where emotions are processed, fMRI scans showed. But the watchers' brains lit up more while seeing abusive treatment of the human than abuse of the robot, suggesting greater empathy for the human. ""We think that, in general, the robot stimuli elicit the same emotional processing as the human stimuli,"" said lead study author Astrid Rosenthal-von der Ptten of the University of Duisburg Essen, in Germany. Rosenthal-von der Ptten suspects that people still have greater empathy for humans than robots, as evidenced by the stronger effect of watching violence toward the human than the robot. Still, the study only assessed people's immediate reactions to the emotional cues, Rosenthal-von der Ptten said. ""We don't know what happens after the short term,"" she said. Human-robot interactions That humans would show empathy for the robot is not surprising, because the bot looked and behaved like an animal, roboticist Alexander Reben, founder of the company BlabDroid, LLC and a research affiliate at MIT, told LiveScience. Reben, who was not involved in the recent study, himself builds small cardboard robots that tap into the human affinity for cute creatures. Some people find the idea of humans empathizing with robots concerning. But Reben compared trends in robot development with breeding dogs for companionship. ""We have been doing this for millennia,"" he said. ""I think we're doing the same thing with robots."" Humans have been known to show empathy for robots in a variety of contexts. For instance, soldiers form bonds with robots on the battlefield. Other research suggests that humans feel more empathy for robots the more realistic they seem , but not if they're too humanlike. As robots become more and more ubiquitous, understanding human-robot interactions will take on increasing importance, Rosenthal-von der Ptten said. The new research will be presented in June at the International Communication Association Conference in London. Copyright 2013 LiveScience , a TechMediaNetwork company. All rights reserved.

"Landmark Election Could Bring Big Change to Malaysia Subscribe Now ! My Account Sign In Sign Out Home :: Military :: Library :: News :: 2013 :: April :: Military Menu Introduction Systems Facilities Agencies Industry Operations Countries Hot Documents News Reports Policy Budget Congress Links WMD Intelligence Homeland Security Space Military Landmark Election Could Bring Big Change to Malaysia April 29, 2013 by Rian Maelzer Malaysia has been a model of political stability over the decades, with the same alliance of parties ruling the country since 1957. But as Malaysians prepare to head to the polls on May 5, many observers believe that could all change -- with an unlikely alliance comprising of secular and religious parties mounting a strong challenge for power. It is shaping up to be the closest election in Malaysia’s history. The campaign is pitting the National Front, headed by Prime Minister Najib Razak, against the opposition People’s Pact, led by former deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim. The ruling National Front is a long-established alliance, made up of ethnic Malay, Chinese and Indian political parties. The opposition is a more recent, looser and diverse alliance. It includes an Islamist party that wants to impose Shariah law, and a mostly-Chinese left-of-center party that staunchly opposes that goal. “It’s a landmark election here in Malaysia, because never in this country’s history have we had the opposition being this strong, this poised, and this prepared to take power in the over 50 years since the country gained independence,” noted political analyst Ibrahim Suffian. Prime Minister Najib pointed to the country’s strong economic growth, and the numerous economic and political reforms he has enacted in his four years in office. His coalition warned that Malaysia’s future prosperity and stability are at stake if the opposition were to win. Norraesah Mohamad of the ruling party UMNO, said the opposition coalition is too fractured to govern effectively. “They have very very different ideologies, the three of them. It is really they are getting together as a marriage of convenience,"" he remarked. ""Each one of them are rowing boats in different directions. They do, you know, as we have a saying here, they share the same pillow but they dream differently.” The opposition may never have ruled the country, but it has governed in five states. Its leaders say they have demonstrated the type of transparent and efficient governance they would practice nationally if they win. Despite concerns about clashing ideologies, Ong Kian Ming of the Opposition Democratic Action Party, said there is far more that unites his alliance than divides it. “There are a lot of common points and policies that we do agree with very strongly,"" he explained. ""For example we stand very strongly against the very rampant corruption that has been a scourge to the Malaysian political system for the longest time, since independence. And we also stand very much for the protection of human rights.” In the 2008 election, the opposition alliance shocked the ruling National Front by winning power in the country’s two most-developed states. This time Anwar and the People’s Pact will hope to go one better and win power nationally.

In a statement on Saturday, the protesters demanded independence from the north. Their calls for southern Yemen to once again be an autonomous state have compounded Yemen's many problems as the impoverished Arab nation struggles with al-Qaida militants and political division. Southerners joined a unified Yemen in 1990. A 1994 attempt by the south to regain independence was crushed in a three-month civil war. The demonstrators criticized a national dialogue aimed at mapping out the country's future after more than a year of protests led to the ouster of the country's longtime autocratic leader in late 2011.

The offer came as the Greens laid out campaign policies at their party congress. https://p.dw.com/p/18OOJ Image: Reuters Advertisement The leader of the Social Democrats (SPD) took to the stage for day two of the Greens' party congress on Saturday to advocate forming a political union. The aim is to defeat a potential coalition formed by Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU) following September's election. In the first address given by an SPD leader at a Green conference, Sigmar Gabriel urged the pro-environmentalist party to cease coalition talks with the conservative CDU. ""Our opponents want us to maul each other,"" Gabriel said. ""As in any relationship, you want to look around and see what's available out there before you decide to move into a flat with a new partner. ""There's no harm looking. We all do that,"" he said, adding: ""You're a special party, you've had a decisive influence on Germany, and you've made Germany a better place."" The SPD, who are second in the polls behind the CDU, would need to form a coalition with the Greens in order to stand a chance of leading the next government. The center-left party are also considered a more natural bed fellow for the Greens. Higher taxes on top earners Day two of the congress in Berlin also saw the Greens set out their campaign program ahead of the September 22 federal election. They pledged to increase taxes on those earning over 80,000 euros ($104,000) to 49 percent from 42 percent, an idea backed by 52 percent of Germans, according to a Politbarometer poll for German broadcaster ZDF released Friday. They also advocated a temporary levy on assets worth over 1 million euros, which was supported by 72 percent of those surveyed. The Greens said revenue generated by the proposal would be spent on education, childcare, environmental projects and reducing debt. To relieve pressure on medium and low-earners, the Greens said they would increase tax-free income from 8,130 euros to 8,700 euros.

Share 2012 Sees Record Number of IDPs share Print The number of people displaced within their own countries by armed conflict, violence and human rights violations totaled nearly 30-million in 2012. Many of the newly displaced were in Syria and the eastern Congo. Embed share Listen to De Capua report on internally displaced people by Voice of America (VOA News) Embed share The code has been copied to your clipboard. The URL has been copied to your clipboard Share on Facebook Share on Twitter No media source currently available 0:00 0:04:08 0:00 Download | MP3 Pop-out player Clare Spurrell of the Internal Displacement Monitoring Center said there were record numbers of IDPs, or internally displaced people, last year. “This last year we saw 28.8 million people who are now internally displaced as a consequence of conflict. This is an increase of two-point-four-million compared to the previous year. And much of this dramatic increase is due to the numbers of people who were newly displaced during the year. So here we saw six-point-five-million people newly displaced, which is an increase of almost 50-percent as compared to 2011, the previous year,” she said. The final displacement figure is determined by adding the number of newly displaced in 2012 to the 2011 total -- and then subtracting the millions who actually returned home last year. Spurrell said that there were different reasons for people being newly displaced in 2011 compared to 2012. “In 2011, it was very much the Arab Spring uprising and the post-election violence in Cote d’Ivoire, which caused a lot of the new displacement that year. This last year we’ve seen the new displacement caused by the escalating violence in eastern DRC and of course the on-going conflict in Syria, which caused really the majority of new displacement.” Spurrell described Syria as the “fastest evolving internal displacement crisis in the world.” “The acceleration is very much due to the fluidity of the conflict and the fact that there’s very much a lack of clear front lines and the subsequent close relationship between internal displacement and the conflict hotspots,” she said. In the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, there were one-million newly internally displaced people in 2012. But there are many people in the region who’ve been displaced for quite some time. Overall, there are nearly three-million internally displaced people there. “These are people who have faced really multiple displacements at the hands of a variety of armed groups within a context of where there’s very much generalized insecurity within the country and a very much weak rule of law. Just to give you an idea of the sort of escalation and the kind of numbers we’re looking at – the March 23 Movement, which is a new armed group in the region, attacked Goma in November last year and in one week alone 140,000 people were displaced,” said Spurrell. Sub-Saharan Africa has 10.4-million IDPs. That’s almost one-third of the world total. Numerous conflicts are the reason. She said, “These very violent conflicts include those in eastern DRC, which I’ve mentioned, but also Mali, Sudan, South Sudan and Somalia are all included.” But Spurrell said that the country with the largest population of IDPs is not in in the Mideast or sub-Saharan Africa, but rather South America. Colombia has between five and five and a half million internally displaced people due to high levels of crime-related violence and armed conflict. “Colombia, DRC and now, indeed, Syria are all situations where there are a real protracted conflict situations, where millions of people are stuck in this protracted displacement situation completely reliant on aid often for many years,” she said. Despite the figures, the Internal Displacement Monitoring Center says there is some encouraging news. Over the last 15 years, about 25 countries have adopted laws and policies to protect IDPs. This includes the Kampala Convention in sub-Saharan Africa. It’s the world’s first legally binding treaty that protects the displaced. Since IDPs have not crossed borders of neighboring countries they are not considered refugees. As a result, many may receive little or no assistance. .

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on Saturday said that the 19-km Chinese intrusion at Daulat Beg Oldie (DBO) sector in eastern Ladakh on April 15 was localized and would be resolved soon. Speaking to journalists on the sidelines of a defence investiture ceremony at the Rashtrapati Bhavan on Saturday, Singh said India does not want to ""accentuate"" the situation and is working on a plan. ""We do have a plan. We do not want to accentuate the situation. We do believe that it is possible to resolve this problem. It is a localized problem. I think the talks are going on,"" he said. The remark came amid indications that government was hopeful of the stand-off being resolved before external affairs minister Salman Khurshid visits China on May 9. India and China are also activating a border mechanism to resolve the intrusion by Chinese troops into Ladakh. Gautam Bambawale, joint secretary in the ministry of external affairs, is expected to travel to Beijing to meet his counterpart on the newly-created working mechanism on boundary issues to attempt to resolve the Chinese intrusion that is threatening to go out of control. Besides, India and the US will be holding a bi-annual dialogue on east Asia. While the conversation is generally dominated by sharing assessments on China, this dialogue acquires extra significance this time, given the state of play on the India-china border. The US side will be led by Joe Yun, who is the acting chief of the US State Departmentâs crucial East Asia bureau after Kurt Campbell , the dynamic assistant secretary resigned in the second Obama administration. Chinese troops had advanced 19 km inside Indian territory on April 15 and since then there has been a stand-off in eastern Ladakh. While the posture has been largely non-aggressive, Indian and Chinese troops are now standing face-to-face just about 100 metres apart on the icy heights. The Chinese are refusing to budge, while India is trying all diplomatic ways to get them to retreat. Itâs unclear whether India will ask the US to help in resolving the stand-off. Separately, Indian and US officials will meet their Japanese counterparts in Washington as well for the next round of the trilateral dialogue. All three countries will be looking to work together in south-east Asia, particularly Myanmar. Japan has returned to Myanmar with a lot of development aid, while India already has a substantial presence inside the country. The effort of all three countries is not only to coordinate their development efforts like pooling resources for infrastructure development in Myanmar. The strategic effort is also to limit growing Chinese influence in Myanmar.

NEW DELHI: Finance minister P Chidambaram on Tuesday assured foreign investors by easing tax residency certificate (TRC) norms and ruled out imposing wealth tax on farm land as the Lok Sabha approved the 2013-14 budget amid a brief discussion and walkout by the opposition. The finance minister moved several other amendments during his brief speech including the move to reduce tax on interest payment to foreign investors in rupee-denominated government and corporate bonds to 5% from 20%. The move is seen as an attempt to attract foreign investment in the debt market to help trim a widening current account deficit. This would be effective for two years starting from June. Chidambaram had promised to undo the âclumsilyâ worded TRC clause which had sparked off anxiety among foreign investors and pulled the stock market down by 291 points after the budget was unveiled in February. The clause that said âa tax residency certificate (TRC) would be a necessary but not sufficient condition for claiming tax benefits under tax treatiesâ was removed. The finance minister also assured the House that the government had no intention to impose wealth tax on farm land. The move was applauded by political parties which had launched a determined bid to get the plan scrapped. âThere was an apprehension that wealth tax was being imposed on agricultural land. Let me make it absolutely clear that the policy of the UPA government is not to impose wealth tax on farm land,â Chidambaram said. âTo make matters so clear, and place it beyond doubt, I have introduced an official amendment which makes it abundantly clear that urban land does not include agricultural land which is recorded as such in government records and which is used for agriculture,â the minister said and made it clear that the amendment would come into effect retrospectively from April 1, 1993. Political parties from across the spectrum had objected to the plan to impose 1% wealth tax on farm land within 8-km radius of urban areas. Chief ministers of Punjab and Haryana had demanded that the proposed tax be scrapped as farmers were being harassed by tax officials. The main opposition BJP had also demanded that the move be abandoned. On the issue of tax residency certificate (TRC), Chidambaram said a certificate issued by a foreign government would be accepted as proof of residency. âAdditional information can also be asked by the government but the TRC issued by a foreign government will be accepted as a certificate of residence,â Chidambaram said. The finance minister also exempted the Railways from service tax payment from July 1 2012 to October 1, 2012 to ease the burden on the state-run transporter. Tax experts cheered the finance ministerâs move on TRC saying it would help attract investment. âThe whole clause which created the confusion has been dropped. That is gone. It certainly lends clarity to the confusion that was created,â said Mukesh Butani, chairman of BMR Advisory, a consultancy firm and added that the move would help in attracting investments. Experts said the twin moves on TRC and tax on interest payment for foreign institutional investors and qualified foreign investors with regard to rupee-denominated government and corporate bonds would help assure investors about the governmentâs intention to attract foreign investment. The government is desperately trying to attract foreign capital to trim a widening current account deficit. Chidambaram has met investors in top financial centres in Singapore, United States and Canada to convince them about the India growth story. The specific clause on tax residency which was included in the finance bill 2012 when the budget was presented had created confusion and scared foreign investors using the Mauritius route for their investment. When it comes to taxation of income in India, a resident of the other country is entitled to claim benefits of the provisions of the relevant tax treaty (such as lower rates of withholding tax in India, or tax exemption). A tax residency certificate is proof of residence in the other country and thus the eligibility to claim the treaty benefits. India has entered into more than 80 tax treaties with several countries including Mauritius. For inward investments into India, Mauritius is a favoured route. Under the India-Mauritius tax treaty on sale of shares of an Indian company by a Mauritius resident, the capital gains are taxed only in the country of residence. As Mauritius does not tax capital gain, the taxpayer enjoys a double bonanza.

"Assisted suicide debate reignited with death of Canadian in Switzerland   | CTV News Home FOLLOW ON Advertisement CTVNEWS Assisted suicide debate reignited with death of Canadian in Switzerland Angela Mulholland CTVNews.ca Published Friday, April 26, 2013 8:38AM EDT Last Updated Friday, April 26, 2013 8:58AM EDT Share: Reddit Share Text: The death of a Canadian woman who fought to end her life with the assistance of a doctors in Switzerland is once again reigniting the difficult debate about assisted suicide, prompting questions about whether it’s time for the federal government to revisit the issue. Susan Griffiths, 72, died peacefully Thursday with family members by her side, at the Dignitas clinic in Zurich, Switzerland. The Manitoba woman had been suffering for the last two years from a disease called multiple system atrophy, a degenerative and fatal condition with symptoms similar to Parkinson's. Griffiths was losing her ability to control her movements and her bodily functions and was in constant pain. In interviews before her death with a number of media outlets, she said she hated the pain and dreaded the prospect of becoming completely dependent on others while she slowly died. Though suicide is not illegal in Canada, helping someone to bring about their own death is. So Griffiths enlisted the help of Dignitas, a non-profit group in Switzerland that offers end-of-life assistance to the terminally ill. Françoise Hébert of Dying With Dignity, a Canadian group working to expand end-of-life choices, says it’s unfortunate that Griffiths had to travel halfway around the world to find the painless and certain death that she wanted. It’s also unfortunate that Griffiths had to choose to die now even though she would have preferred to live longer. “She had a terrible disease and it was going to get worse. So she had to go to Switzerland sooner than she would have liked because she had to be well enough,” Hebert told CTV’s Canada AM Friday. “She said in one interview she would have preferred to live maybe two or three years longer. And so because of the fact that she couldn’t have assistance with dying in Canada, she had no option.” Hebert says it appears Griffiths was firm in her carefully-considered decision to travel to Switzerland. “It’s never anybody’s first choice. Most people want to die at home, surrounded by their family and friends,” Hebert said. Before her death, Griffiths wrote in an email to The Canadian Press: ""I sincerely hope that Canadian laws will change soon to allow individuals like myself to make end-of-life choices at home."" Hebert says the federal government would likely prefer not to revisit the issue of assisted suicide, but a case currently before the courts is likely going to compel them to do so anyway. A British Columbia court considered the case of Gloria Taylor, who wanted to end her suffering from ALS ruled last year that Canada’s assisted suicide laws were unconstitutional. They agreed the ban on doctor-assisted suicide violated the Charter of Rights because it discriminated against people with disabilities, insofar as suicide is legal for people who are physically able to end their lives, but assisted suicide for debilitated patients is not. The federal government appealed that decision before the B.C. Court of Appeal. During hearings in that appeal last month, federal lawyers argued that allowing doctor-assisted suicide would put vulnerable and disabled patients at risk of being coerced to kill themselves. While a ruling on that case is expected later this year, Hebert expects the arguments will go all the way to the Supreme Court. “The debate is on again. And it will last another three or four years,” Hebert said. The top court has not examined this country's assisted-suicide ban since 1993, when the court upheld the law in a case involving Sue Rodriguez, who also suffered from ALS. She died the following year with the help of an unidentified doctor. Amy Hasbrouck, a disability rights activist, defends Canada’s stance on assisted suicide. She worries about how changing the laws would affect the disabled, who she says are continually made to feel as though their lives are not worth living. “When a person with a disability wants to commit suicide, everybody thinks, ‘Oh, that’s a great idea, because they’re suffering,’” she told Canada AM from Montreal. “But when a non-disabled person wants to commit suicide, society mobilizes itself to prevent that suicide even to the point of curtailing their liberty by putting them in a psychiatric facility. “And our concern is where that double standard comes from. And that double standard comes from an assumption that life with a disability is a fate worse than death.” RELATED IMAGES view larger image The death of Canadian Susan Griffiths has reignited the heated and controversial debate on assisted suicide.

NEW YORK: The US government has sued Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corp , claiming it gave kickbacks to pharmacies to switch kidney transplant patients from competitorsâ drugs to its own. The civil healthcare fraud lawsuit in US District Court in Manhattan has sought unspecified damages and civil penalties for a scheme that the government said has been carried out since 2005. US Attorney Preet Bharara said on Tuesday that the company used the âlure of kickbacks disguised as rebatesâ to turn 20 or more pharmacies into a sales force for its drug, Myfortic. He said the companyâs actions caused the public to pay tens of millions of dollars for kickback-tainted drugs dispensed by pharmacists who had buddied up to Novartis. Bharara said Novartis is a repeat offender, having settled fraud charges based on kickbacks less than three years ago. Novartis said in a statement that it disputes the claims and will defend itself. It said the investigation into the companyâs interactions with specialty pharmacies related to the handling of Myfortic had been previously disclosed. âAs a leading healthcare company, Novartis strives to achieve high performance with high integrity. NPC is committed to high standards of ethical business conduct and regulatory compliance in the sale and marketing of our products.â The government said Novartis offered one pharmacist a âbonusâ rebate amounting to several hundred thousand dollars to âshoulder the burdenâ of switching 700 to 1,000 transplant patients to Myfortic.

"Five Of The World's Most Endangered Sea Turtles Released Into The Wild After A Year Of Rehab [VIDEO] | Nature World News Home Animals Biology Environment Health & Medicine Tech Travel Space Natureworldnews.com Let's Connect Trending Hurricane Milton farmers climate change elephants storm surge Five Of The World's Most Endangered Sea Turtles Released Into The Wild After A Year Of Rehab [VIDEO] By Tamarra Kemsley Apr 29, 2013 02:06 PM EDT Facebook Twitter Linkedin Comment Mail The Institute for Marine Mammal Studies released along with volunteers five rehabilitated Kemp's Ridley sea turtles, but not before the animals were blessed with holy water by the local Rev. Louis Lohan. The turtles were rescued in 2012 and were treated at IMMS for serious injuries, according to the Sun Herald. One of the turtles, named Chipper after the town's mayor, was outfitted with a satellite transmitter prior to release. Its movements will be tracked publicly on the IMMS website. The other turtles included Sunshine, Garfield, Nicky and Diva, as well as one green sea turtle named Greenie Beanie. ""The Kemp's Ridley is the most endangered of all sea turtle species,"" IMMS President Moby Solangi told the Sun Herald. The species is protected by various international treaties and agreements, including the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna, which restricts its international trade. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) Fisheries Office of Protected Resources, the Kemp’s Ridley, which are distributed largely throughout the Gulf of Mexico and U.S. Atlantic seaboard, has experienced a dramatic decrease in nesting sizes since 1947 from an estimated 42,000 to just 200 annually between 1978 and 1991. However, this number has increased steadily over the past decade peaking in 2009 at just over 20,000. A possible reason for this increase is the development of turtle excluder devices (TEDs), which reduce the mortality of sea turtles incidentally captured in shrimp trawl gear. Furthermore, the U.S. has prohibited the importation of shrimp harvested in a manner with adverse effects on sea turtles. Furthermore, egg collection of the species was outlawed in 1966 and no longer poses a major threat to the animal. Unfortunately, according to the National Wildlife Federation , the Kemp’s Ridley were the hardest hit sea turtle species by the BP oil spill: of 600 dead turtles, 500 were Kemp’s Ridley.

""We do believe it is possible to resolve this problem. Talks are going on,"" Singh told journalists. ""It is a localized problem."" Singh's statement came a day after Indian Defense Secretary Shashi Kant Sharma told parliament that Chinese soldiers had put up tents some 12 miles into the disputed Himalayan border zone on April 15. The area saw heavy fighting during the month-long war between China and India in 1962. The informal border between China and India is called the Line of Actual Control. New Delhi and Beijing have signed two deals to keep the peace in the region. China denied last week its troops had crossed the Line, but on Friday Beijing said the two nuclear-armed countries had the ""wisdom"" to solve the row through ""friendly consultation"". Singh also warned against a rise in tensions between the two countries, whose bilateral trade hit nearly $76 billion last year.

Matters YOU US TNS World Saudi Arabia’s anti-corruption probe ends with dozens detained By AFP February 01, 2019 RIYADH: Saudi Arabia announced late on Wednesday the end of a high-profile anti-corruption probe that boosted the state coffers by more than $100 billion and has left dozens detained. The crackdown on graft launched in 2017 saw hundreds of elite princes, ministers and businessmen held at the luxury Ritz-Carlton hotel in the Saudi capital Riyadh. Many were detained for weeks in the upmarket hotel, but most were released after agreeing significant financial settlements. The corruption investigation concluded Wednesday with the approval of King Salman, according to a statement released by the official Saudi Press Agency. ""The public prosecutor has refused to settle the cases of 56 individuals due to already existing criminal charges against them,"" the statement said. An additional eight people have seen their cases referred to the public prosecutor after they refused to reach settlements. ""Settlements were reached with 87 individuals after their confession to the charges against them,"" SPA said. During the probe more than 400 billion Saudi riyal ($107 billion) were recovered by the state ""in the form of real estate, companies, cash, and other assets"". The figure matches that announced a year ago by the attorney general, who at the time said 56 suspects remained in custody. Saudi’s anti-graft sweep led by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has been labelled by some critics as a shakedown and power grab, but authorities have insisted the purge targeted endemic corruption.

But now, they are showing the way when it comes to other activities too. A team of ten students from IIT-Madras has been adjudged the most outstanding delegation at the New York Global Young Leaders Summit International Model United Nations. The event had around 600 participants from 60 different countries. The summit was held to gather students from across the five continents and offer confrontation on policies between culturally-diverse leaders, with the United Nations as the backdrop. The delegation from IIT-Madras was chosen to represent two countries — India and Iran. Seven committees of the UN — the General Assembly (three committees — the Disarmament and International Security Committee, the Economic and Financial Committee and Social and Cultural and Humanitarian Affairs), Security Council, United Nations Development Programme, Human Rights Council and the Special Session on Millennium Development Goals were simulated. “While there were participants who were extremely sound with policies and issues and articulate about solutions, there were also many who found it difficult to speak in English. The experience, overall, was very enriching,” said Aniruddh Padia, a participant. “Even the delegates who met us after the event expressed surprise because we come from a technical institution. Maybe looking at problems logically and doing an exhaustive research really helps,” said Ashwin Kalkar, another participant. “It is only in congregations such as this you realise problems are dealt with a different intensity in every country. Something like reservation that is so common and widely debated here, was not even considered by delegates from America because they already have a good representation,” said Aniruddh. Recruited by employers on the first day, and top scorers in academics too, most of the students in this team of youngsters are from various branches of engineering. A few are from the humanities stream too. Three of the students also won the Outstanding Delegate Awards in their respective committees. “Being diplomatic is the key here but you have to be convincing too, which was challenging,” said Ashwin.

The Turkish General Staff said it doesn't plan to give up its positions in southeastern Turkey during the withdrawal, Turkish daily newspaper Today's Zaman reports. PKK supporters expressed frustration that departing forces didn't have security guarantees from the military. The military had launched assaults on departing PKK forces during similar efforts to abandon Turkish territory. The Turkish government said it was ceding to the provincial authorities regarding any reaction to the PKK withdrawal. At least 40,000 people have died in fighting between the PKK and the Turkish military since the 1980s. A phased formal withdrawal is expected to begin next week.

This may be precisely why he is more popular among young Britons than any other Windsor. Von Christoph Scheuermann 24.04.2013, 18.06 Uhr Zur Merkliste hinzufügen X.com Facebook E-Mail Link kopieren Weitere Optionen zum Teilen X.com Facebook E-Mail Messenger WhatsApp Link kopieren Dieser Beitrag stammt aus dem SPIEGEL-Archiv. Warum ist das wichtig? To get a better idea of who Henry Charles Albert David is, one could read the seven or eight biographies published on the 28-year-old to date. But a visit to the bars Prince Harry often frequents until the early morning hours is even more revealing. ""He's an incredibly nice guy,"" says the bartender at the Rum Kitchen. ""Down to earth, very funny,"" says a waitress at Bodo's Schloss. ""Unaffected,"" says the manager of the Mahiki. Harry glides through London nightlife like many of his contemporaries with a lot of money and a taste for kitschy décor. One of the unusual things about this prince is his very normality. Of course, Harry's mother played an important role in her son growing up to be less inhibited than her husband. Diana, the tragic princess, fought to the end to ensure that Harry and his brother William were not quashed by Britain's royal disciplinary machine, with its strict protocol for every blink of an eye. It seems that Diana was most successful with her younger son. ""Harry has done everything he can to be ordinary, to have a normal life,"" writes journalist Chris Hutchins, whose biography of Prince Harry will be released this week. One reason the British are more likely to take to a prince known for getting drunk is that they can recognize themselves in him. Harry recently advanced to third place on the list of the most popular members of the royal family, after Prince William and the Queen, and ahead of his father Charles. Young Britons idolize him as the most laid-back Windsor England has seen in a long time. Every monarchy thrives on images, glamour and rituals, but it also runs the risk of eventually becoming ossified within these rituals. This was evident last week during the funeral service for former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in St. Paul's Cathedral, where the Queen and her husband sat almost motionless for about an hour on velvet-covered chairs, looking like wax figures of themselves. British author Hilary Mantel wrote that Princess Kate is so perfect with her ""plastic smile"" that she ""appeared to have been designed by a committee and built by craftsmen."" 'I Can Do What I Want' Harry, by contrast, is unpredictable, unruly and impulsive, not unlike his mother. He seems spirited in a world of plastic smiles. And his family, too, is beginning to realize the value of a prince who doesn't always stick to the rules. Almost more than his brother, the task falls to Harry to prove that the Windsors are not an obsolete royal family, and that they can lead the monarchy into the 21st century. This is one reason for Harry's growing importance. He is also garnering more media attention, as a swarm of cameras and microphones permanently lies in waiting for his next excess. Harry hates this, because it reminds him that he is not ordinary. He has despised the paparazzi since his mother's fatal accident in Paris in 1997, and he would prefer to see them banished from the island. But the monarchy depends on its popularity among the people, which is one basis of its legitimacy today. Harry knows that this is why he must come to terms with the media mob. Niraj Tanna is a member of that mob. Before devoting himself to the royal family in 2005, he photographed pop musicians and actors in London. ""But stars have no significance,"" says Tanna. ""The monarchy, however, means something, and it will remain relevant in the future."" Besides, he adds, it's fun to outsmart Harry's bodyguards. Though he is only 32, Tanna is already a veteran paparazzo. He has photographed Harry's various affairs, and he has seen him drunk, distraught, happy and angry. Harry also knows Tanna, which makes it increasingly difficult for the photographer to approach the prince without being recognized. The party prince is a good subject, because he struggles with a role that has been established since he was born. Tanna is prepared to rush through the city at all times of the day or night when he hears that Harry was just spotted at a party. He receives his tips from waiters, bartenders, guests and the managers of the city's hottest clubs. For a London bar owner, a visit by Harry is the best publicity possible. The prince is currently third in the line for succession to the throne, after Charles and William, but he will slip down to fourth place when Kate's baby is born. The circumstances would have to be extremely unusual for Harry to become king, which gives him a freedom his brother would never have. ""Harry is the guy who is more risk-taking,"" says Ken Wharfe, Princess Diana's bodyguard for six years. Unlike William, he says, Harry wanted to be entertained as a child. He would run through the palace, knock over vases and pour red food coloring into his bodyguard's bath water. Even as a young boy, he said to William: ""You'll be king one day. I won't, so I can do what I want."" Excess in Real Time Harry was apparently more upset by his mother's death than anyone else in the family. He discovered alcohol early on, and at his father's 50 th birthday party he drank too much, tore his clothes off and ran naked among the guests. He was 14 at the time. The next year, he was in Cornwall throwing around cider bottles. It was easy to interpret Harry's excesses as a reaction to his mother's death, but in truth he was behaving no differently than his friends. England around the turn of the millennium was an island of all-you-can-drink parties. Harry, in a radical way, was living the ordinary life his mother had always wanted for him and William. No one was surprised that he did worse in school than his brother. He set up a disco, bar included, in the basement of the royal residence at Highgrove House. The parties there apparently also involved drugs. A friend allegedly obtained marijuana and invited girls, although Harry never needed any help with women. The pubs around Highgrove were his hunting ground, writes Chris Hutchins in the new biography. Harry's best chat-up line was: ""How would you like to come back to my palace for a drink?"" At 17, he admitted that he had smoked pot. The press called him ""His Royal High-Ness,"" and his nickname among friends was ""Hashish Harry."" From the palace's perspective, the danger did not lie in Harry's interests in women, drugs and alcohol but in the fact that all of this was being revealed to the public. This is especially true now that every party guest who can whip out a mobile phone at the right moment can turn a photo of Harry into cash. He is the first prince whose excesses are being transmitted in what is essentially real time. The Prince Harry Watch, run by an American woman who disseminates her information through Twitter, provides constant updates on the prince's whereabouts. ""Harry seen in Las Vegas,"" she wrote last August. Photos later turned up of the naked prince during a game of strip billiards. Recipe for Disaster Harry has become more cautious since then. He has behaved more like an adult, says photographer Tanna, since he flew to Afghanistan as a soldier for the first time in 2007. ""You could see that he had gotten more serious, more of a man."" The great advantage of Afghanistan was that there were no photographers nearby, because the palace and the defense ministry impose a news blackout the minute Harry shows up in a war zone. He flies combat helicopters, and some say that he has a little too much fun doing it. When asked about his deployment to Afghanistan in a BBC interview after the Las Vegas scandal, he said that he loved playing PlayStation, ""So with my thumbs I like to think I'm probably quite useful."" The army gives him the elbowroom he so sorely misses. It allows him to be himself, to the extent possible, surrounded by many other young men. Last year was Harry's best year so far. Vanity Fair named him the best-dressed member of the royal family. He managed to convince his grandmother to allow the band Madness to perform on the roof of Buckingham Palace at the Queen's Diamond Jubilee concert. He reportedly also persuaded the Queen to appear in a short film alongside Daniel Craig, the actor who plays James Bond, at the opening ceremony for the London Summer Olympics. These are the sorts of things that make the royal family seem more modern than it really is. For the last few months, Harry has been seeing Cressida Bonas, four years his junior, whose mother was married four times and has had five children with three different men. He turns 30 next year. His life is becoming more settled, or at least it seems that way. More recently, says photographer Tanna, he has only been seen stumbling out of the apartments of friends after having downed a few bottles of wine with them, or renting a restaurant in London's Notting Hill neighborhood for dinner. Is Harry becoming boring? ""Don't worry, the story is just beginning with Harry's new relationship,"" says Tanna. ""I'm sure there is much more that we will see in the future.""

This is probably precisely the reason he is more popular among young Britons than any of the other royals, though. Here, a newstand displays a tabloid with the naked prince on the cover in August 2012. Foto: TOBY MELVILLE/ REUTERS 2 / 9 In this image released in January 2013, Prince Harry wears a Santa hat at the VHR (very high readiness) tent close to the flight-line at the British controlled flight-line at Camp Bastion in Afghanistan, where the helicopter pilot was serving at the time.

Foto: dpa Picture-Alliance // picture alliance / Photoshot 4 / 9 The 28-year-old strives to live an ordinary life, which has made him increasingly popular with the British people. Harry recently advanced to third place on the list of the most popular members of the royal family, after Prince William and the Queen, and ahead of his father Charles. Young Britons idolize him as the most laid-back Windsor England has seen in a long time. Here, he poses with children at a charity awards ceremony.

One reason the British are more likely to take to a prince known for getting drunk is that they can recognize themselves in him.

In contrast with the rest of the royals, he is unpredictable, unruly and impulsive, not unlike his mother. He seems spirited in a world of plastic smiles.

Sánchez has been embraced by some, and criticized by others during her voyage. In her open letter, the Spanish-Syrian blogger Nachawati refers to some of Sánchez's comments on the Spanish state and society: I was struck by your admiration towards the policies and institutions of this country [Spain]. I cannot deny that you may value aspects that pass unnoticed to many of us who live live here, but the truth is that our reality is far from a mirror to want to look into.

By Josh Sanburn April 24, 2013 Share Read Later Send to Kindle D Dipasupil / FilmMagic / Getty Images United States Senator Rand Paul attends the 2013 Time 100 Gala at Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center on April 23, 2013 in New York City. Email Print Share Facebook Twitter Tumblr LinkedIn StumbleUpon Reddit Digg Mixx Delicious Google+ Follow @TIMENewsfeed Correction appended at 2:40 p.m. American travelers began to feel the bite of across-the-board budget cuts known as sequestration this week, as the Federal Aviation Administration furloughed 1,500 air traffic controllers, prompting delays for hundreds of flights. By law, sequestration requires uniform cuts to every “program, project or activity” not explicitly exempted by Congress, including the FAA, and the Republican-led House was explicit about that in its report for fiscal year 2013 appropriations for the agency. President Obama, who opposes the cuts, nevertheless gets to decide some matters of timing, via powers given to the White House Office of Management and Budget under the law — and the furloughing of 10% of the nation’s 15,000 air traffic controllers is among the first budget reductions to take effect. ( MORE: Sequestration Begins to Bite ) As the cuts’ impact worsens, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) and White House adviser Valerie Jarrett — both of whom were honored Tuesday night at the TIME 100 gala in New York City — had strikingly different versions of who’s to blame. “I think that it’s inexcusable to take important things like travel, air traffic controllers or meat inspectors or something that most of us agree we should have, and play a game with it,” Sen. Paul said. “The same day that [President Obama] announces that we have no self-guided tours in the White House, he sends $250 million to Egypt. We’ve got money. It’s a matter of priorities, and a good leader wouldn’t cut essential services. So I think it’s a bit of a charade and it ought to stop.” Republicans are accusing the White House of playing politics with the budget cuts, arguing that the president is front-loading cuts to vital programs like air traffic control in order to force Congress to lift sequestration altogether. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid tried and failed on Tuesday to move a bill through the Senate that would have canceled the cuts for the remaining five months of the fiscal year. ( MORE: ‘We’re Not Bending’ to Terrorism: Vice President Biden at Emotional TIME 100 Gala ) But Jarrett, an adviser to the president, says the problem with sequestration isn’t about funding priorities. The issue, she says, is the imposition of sequestration itself. “We don’t [have the money],” said Jarrett, in response to Paul’s statement. “And that was the whole point of why we wanted to avoid the sequester, because it doesn’t provide you with the flexibility that you need. We made it very clear last year what the consequences would be if we didn’t take the appropriate action to turn it off. Obviously, this is something we want to avoid if we could.” Correction: A previous version of this article stated that Democrats have accused the White House of playing politics on sequestration. That is inaccurate and the post has been updated.

"PLA chief hopes China, US will forge 'new type of military relationship' | South China Morning Post Advertisement China’s military China PLA chief hopes China, US will forge 'new type of military relationship' General Fang Fenghui says US General Martin Dempsey's visit is an important event in the bilateral armed forces exchange programme Reading Time: 2 minutes Why you can trust SCMP Mandy Zuo in Shanghai and Bloomberg Published: 12:00am, 23 Apr 2013 Updated: 4:56pm, 20 Jun 2018 General Fang Fenghui, People's Liberation Army chief of general staff, hopes China and the United States can forge a ""new type of military relationship"" in talks with visiting chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Martin Dempsey. Advertisement Fang called their talks in Beijing yesterday - the first high-level meeting between military chiefs of the world's two biggest economies since leadership reshuffles in both countries - ""an important event in the bilateral military exchange programme"". At a joint news conference, Dempsey defended the re-orientation of American foreign policy towards Asia, after Beijing last week criticised Washington for ramping up its military presence in the region. ""We seek to be a stabilising influence in the region,"" he said. ""In fact, we believe it would be our absence that would be destabilising in the region, not our presence."" Fang suggested that the two nations work together to improve communication and co-ordination to deal with any possible crisis in the region. ""[The interaction] not only concerns the relations between the two armies, but also affects the peace and stability of the Asia-Pacific region,"" he said. ""We share the responsibility of jointly safeguarding [it]."" Beijing and Washington have in recent months traded accusations of massive cyber-intrusions. When asked whether China was willing to delegate staff to set rules for global cybersecurity, Fang said that the internet, ""if it is not managed well, may bring damaging consequences"". If security cannot be guaranteed, it is not an exaggeration to say that the consequences could be as serious as a nuclear bomb ""If security cannot be guaranteed, it is not an exaggeration to say that the consequences could be as serious as a nuclear bomb,"" he said.

Reports said at least 20 pickup trucks loaded with antiaircraft guns blocked roads while armed men directed traffic away from the ministry building in Tripoli. Armed groups also tried but failed to storm the Interior Ministry and the state news agency. Prime Minister Ali Zaidan said such attacks will not deter the government. The siege was aimed at pressing a demand for a law -- which has already been proposed -- banning Qaddafi-era officials from senior government positions. The protest came just days after the French Embassy in Tripoli was bombed, raising fresh concerns about security in the Libyan capital.

Today a driver of a school bus was arrested for allegedly drugging and raping a 15-year-old girl in Bikaner, reported India Today. The teenager attended a private school in Bikaner and after she reported the alleged attack a man identified as Rajesh Kumar, 35, was arrested, 'The girl was on her way to the school on April 26 when the driver met and offered her lift to the school.

Change: Activists say passing new, strong laws is not enough, and that the government must ensure that police and the justice system crack down on crimes against women . Publicity: Rape has been a problem in India for many years, but the fatal gang rape of a woman on a New Delhi bus has pushed the issue to the top of the national agenda Sexual assaults in India have been increasing for many years, but the fatal gang rape of a woman on a New Delhi bus has pushed the issue to the top of the national agenda. The brutal attack sparked outrage about the treatment of women in the country and has made females more aware of the danger they face . Sexual crimes against women and children are reported every day in Indian newspapers, and women often complain about feeling insecure when they leave their homes. Since the bus gang-rape incident dozens of rapes cases in India - against both Indian women and tourists have been highlighted. Clashes: Police have been criticised for using heavy handed tactics against demonstrators who are demanding better protection of women following the brutal bus gang rape The attack forced India to confront the reality that sexually-assaulted women are often blamed for the crime, forcing them to keep quiet and discouraging them from reporting it to authorities for fear of exposing their families to ridicule. Activists say passing new, strong laws is not enough, and that the government must ensure that police and the justice system crack down on crimes against women. Women face daily harassment across India, ranging from catcalls on the streets, groping and touching in public transport, to rape. Government data show the number of reported rape cases in the country rose by nearly 17 percent between 2007 and 2011. Rape victims rarely press charges because of social stigma and fear they will be accused of inviting the attack. Many women say they structure their lives around protecting themselves and their daughters from attack. Share or comment on this article:

"Thousands attend funeral of Nablus shooting victim - The Jerusalem Post Advertisement JP Newsletter Israel News Health & Wellness WORLD NEWS Middle East Business & Innovation Opinion JP Store Login Log Out Archaeology Israel Real Estate Judaism Kabbalah Environment Antisemitism JP Spanish Podcasts JP Shopping Conversation Corner Premium Jerusalem Post Thousands attend funeral of Nablus shooting victim Limor Livnat on nephew's murder: ""He was murdered simply because he was a Jew"";  some mourners stone Palestinian cars, call for revenge. By JPOST.COM STAFF APRIL 24, 2011 17:29 Nablus shooting 311 (photo credit: Reuters) Thousands of people on Sunday attended the funeral of Ben Yosef Livnat, who was shot dead earlier in the day by a Palestinian policeman at Joseph's Tomb in Nablus. Livnat was laid to rest at the Mount of Olives cemetery in Jerusalem. The funeral was attended by settlement leaders from the West Bank, right-wing activists, rabbis and public figures, and Minister of Sports and Culture Limor Livnat, Ben Yosef's aunt. RELATED: Barak condemns Nablus shooting attack; orders IDF probe Yesha Council: Nablus shooting 'cannot pass silently' During the funeral, the sports and culture minister commented on her nephew's murder, saying ""I woke up this morning, Ben Yosef's mom called me and told me he was murdered by a terrorist disguised as a Palestinian policeman. This is cold-blooded murder. Ben Yosef went to pray with other Jews, and he was murdered simply because he was Jewish. It is hard to grasp these things. My own nephew, a personal sacrifice, may he be the last victim."" Some participants at the funeral made calls for revenge for Ben Yosef's murder. However, the victim's father, Noam Livnat, said ""revenge is irrelevant because the murderers will get what they deserve."" Other teens and young adults who were part of Livnat's funeral procession from the Elon Moreh settlement to Jerusalem, stoned and burned Palestinian cars in the Samaria region, injuring one Palestinian lightly. Settlers said that it was ""scandalous"" that Palestinians were allowed to drive on the road on a day like this. Ben Yosef Livnat was killed when a vehicle he was in was shot at by a Palestinian Authority policeman as he and a group of other worshipers were exiting the city from prayer services held at Joseph's Tomb. Magen David Adom said one person was in serious condition, one in moderate condition and two others in light condition. The four were detained by police for obstructing the investigation and refusing to tell authorities their version of events. Police have requested the Haifa Magistrate's Court extend the remand of three of the injured. According to an IDF initial investigation, three vehicles containing Breslev worshipers entered the tomb in violation of a decree by the IDF's Central Command prohibiting entry of Israelis into Area A without prior coordination. A verbal confrontation ensued between the worshipers and the Palestinian policemen, who called on them to leave the area. The Breslev vehicles failed to stop at a checkpoint outside of the religious site, the investigation found. The policemen then fired shots in the air. The worshipers tried to flee the area, and their vehicles came under fire, killing Livnat, 24, father of four, and wounding four others.

Less happily, he was at the airport to greet her when she returned from honeymoon – and announce that her husband had stolen £18,500 from the family business. Graham Astrand, 53, who employed Huw Jones as a sales executive at his car dealership, made the shocking discovery of betrayal shortly after the couple's departure to the Caribbean. Perfect wedding: Charlie Astrand, 25, with her new husband Huw Jones, 31, on their wedding day. Charlie's father Graham is pictured left, and her mother Alison is right. But when she returned from honeymoon, the primary school teacher's dream turned into a nightmare Yesterday Miss Astrand, 25, said her 'world came crashing in' when she learned that the man she had married was a fraud. She and 31-year-old Jones had been away for only two days when Mr Astrand discovered his new son-in-law had fiddled the books. He went to the police but was advised to let the couple finish their honeymoon before confronting his employee. RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Jilted lover, 33, overturned ex's caravan with a tractor... Share this article Share After paying for the white wedding and contributing towards the two-week honeymoon on the island of Aruba, Mr Astrand waited at the airport arrivals lounge armed with proof of Jones's crimes. Miss Astrand, whose marriage collapsed at that point, said: 'It was the worst moment of my life – I had just had the most blissful honeymoon with the man I loved. 'But then everything was shattered. My world came crashing in on me. 'I saw my dad waiting to pick me up – he gave me the biggest hug I've ever had. But Huw's family were there too and they just sort of whisked him away without a word. Anguish: Charlie, 25, with her father Graham who broke the news to her that her new husband had been stealing from the family home as he drove her back from the airport 'I asked my dad what was wrong and he just said, “Come to the car”.' Miss Astrand was shown the paperwork which proved her new husband had helped himself to the cash from the family firm in Aberdare, South Wales. She continued: 'I had a panic attack in the car – I couldn't take in what was happening. In the four years I had known him there was not the slightest clue anything was wrong. 'We lived together for two years and he was loving, caring and romantic, always spoiling me with presents and treats. 'My family thought the world of him – he was hard-working and committed to building a happy home and future for us.' The post-honeymoon drama was revealed at Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court when Jones, the son of a policeman, admitted 24 charges of fraud, forgery and theft but was spared jail. Picture perfect: Charlie's parents paid £20,000 for her wedding and contributed towards their two-week luxury honeymoon on the Caribbean island of Aruba Wedding joy: Charlie, right, had no idea that Huw Jones was defrauding her father's company during her four-year relationship - until the news was broken to her after her honeymoon His secret: Huw kept the deception from his new bride Charlie but has now admitted 24 charges of fraud, forgery and theft Mr Astrand and his wife Alison were in court to hear how £18,478 'fell through the gaps' of the company accounting system. Prosecutor Heath Edwards said: 'Jones had forged signatures, manipulated the accounts and sweetened deals. He forged documents and upped the amount of money in loan applications, unbeknown to customers. 'He did it to impress his fiancée and her family – and to up his sales figures for commission.' The court heard Jones cunningly hid his dodgy dealings during his two-year engagement to his boss's daughter, leading up to their marriage in July 2010. Mr Edwards said: 'Mr Astrand was waiting at the airport to confront his new son-in-law when he stepped off the plane.' Laurence Jones, defending, said: 'Jones had taken on responsibilities he could not cope with in an overwhelming desire to impress his future father-in-law.' He added that Jones had 'learned a very long, hard salutary lesson and is remorseful for his actions'. Judge Dan Williams gave Jones a nine-month suspended jail sentence, telling him: 'I have given you a chance even though I am not convinced you deserve it. Please don't blow it.' Joy that didn't last: Charlie, left, has now got a new boyfriend while Huw has remarried and become a father Family delight: Charlie, 25, with her parents Graham and Alison on her wedding day in 2010. Days later Graham discovered Charlie's husband, and his employee, had been carrying out a deception Con: When this picture was taken Huw Jones' deception was still a secret - but it unravelled days later Jones was also ordered to carry out 250 hours unpaid work and complete a 'thinking skills programme'. Afterwards Miss Astrand said: 'I was in tears again when I found out he was not going to jail. That would have been the right sentence for what he did to me and my family. 'I was terribly hurt and it's taken me two years to get over it.' Jones remarried last month after becoming a father six months ago. His ex-wife, who has started a new relationship with accountant Chris Henneman, said of her former husband: 'He has lived a happy life for the past two-and-a-half years – he's met someone new, got married and even has a child. He still hasn't paid a price for everything he did. Every day we have to deal with it. 'We really thought he would go to prison and that would be the end of it. But I feel like he's had no punishment for the pain and hurt he's caused me and my family.' She added: 'I have a very happy life with Chris, and it's because of him I am where I am today – he's been my rock.' Mr Astrand said of the sentence: 'I wanted justice for Charlie and for our customers but he was let off with a suspended sentence. That is a disgrace. He deserved to spend time behind bars for what he had done.' Wedding day joy: Charlie, 25, and Huw, 31, who subsequently divorced and both have new partners Mother's pride: Alison Astrand with her daughter Charlie on the wedding day in 2010 Beautiful bride: Charlie Astrand, 25, on her wedding day.

Kelly Ayotte's, R-N.H., approval rating dropped 15 points, following her vote against the Senate's measure to impose stricter gun background checks. From PPP : Ayotte now has a negative approval rating with 44% of voters giving her good marks and 46% disapproving. That's down a net 15 points from the last time we polled on her, in October, when she had a 48% approval with 35% disapproving. 75% of New Hampshire voters- including 95% of Democrats, 74% of independents, and 56% of Republicans- say they support background checks. And 50% of voters in the state say Ayotte's 'no' vote will make them less likely to support her in a future election, compared to just 23% who consider it to be a positive.

But acting on Supreme Court’s order, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation has served demolition on seven buildings in the compound, and asked its residents to vacate their flats within 48 hours. Around 140 families, who have been living there for more than 25 years, have filed a review petition in the apex court alleging that a nexus between the civic body and builders was behind their ordeal. In 1955, BMC leased the land to Pure Drinks Ltd. for establishing a factory. In 1980, it sought permission from the civic body to develop a large portion of the land for residential purposes, and signed an agreement with three builders to construct the seven buildings. Out of the seven, two are towers with 17 and 20 floors respectively, while three buildings have six floors each and two have seven floors. According to BMC, the builders were permitted to construct only five floors and all the floors above that are illegal. The apex court, in its order on February 2013, permitted the BMC to demolish the unauthorised floors. The decision could turn out to be a landmark one for a city battling unauthorised structures. It all started in 2005, when the residents of the society, demanding setting up of a water connection, realised the buildings’ plans were never officially passed and none of the residents given occupation certificates despite residing in the buildings for 25 years. This, despite the fact that BMC officials regularly collected property tax from the residents. The flats were purchased 25 years ago and the purchasers were allegedly fooled by the builders, who told them that the plans had been put up for approval. In reality, the BMC rejected all of them. “It was also not told to us that during the construction the BMC had issued stop work notices and collected penalties from the builders,” said Rohit Malhotra, a resident at the compound. Interestingly, the government accepted relevant stamp duty from buyers while officially registering all the flats. According to the residents, many of whom are senior citizens, the BMC’s demolition notice will destroy their lives even though they were not at fault. “We are ready to pay the fine for the FSI violation and there are such provisions in BMC. But since this property is at the prime spot in Mumbai, the civic body seems not interested in following their own circulars,” Mr. Malhotra said. If the buildings violated FSI norms then why were civic officials silent for so many years, he asked. A senior BMC official told The Hindu that the civic body was acting on the Supreme Court’s order. But Mr. Malhotra alleged that the residents were being targeted and said they wouldn’t vacate their flats. “They do not dare touch Adarsh CHS, but want to destroy our lives. We will fight till the end.” Published - April 27, 2013 04:28 am IST Read Comments Copy link Email Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit READ LATER Remove SEE ALL PRINT Related stories Illegal flats on Campa Cola compound face demolition Related Topics Mumbai Top News Today 0 / 0 Read in App The Hindu About Us Code of Editorial Values News Archive Sitemap Print Subscription Digital Subscription Subscribe to Newsletters Rss Feeds Readers Editor-Terms of Reference Authors & Contributors Frame Front page Contact us Contact Us Social Media Advertise With Us Group News Sites Business Line BL on Campus Sportstar Frontline இந்து தமிழ் திசை The Hindu Centre Young World Club The Hindu ePaper Business Line ePaper Crossword + Free Games Other Products RoofandFloor STEP Images Classifieds - Print Bookstore & Special Publications Popular Sections Elections Israeli–Palestinian conflict 2023 Latest News National News International News Videos Life & Style Food Podcast Showcase Opinion Editorial Columns Comment Cartoon Letters Interview Lead Business Agri-Business Industry Economy Markets Budget Sport Cricket Football Hockey Tennis Athletics Motorsport Races Other Sports Sci-Tech Science Technology Health Agriculture Environment Gadgets Internet States Andhra Pradesh Karnataka Kerala Tamil Nadu Telangana Cities Bengaluru Chennai Coimbatore Delhi Hyderabad Kochi Kolkata Kozhikode Madurai Mangaluru Mumbai Puducherry Thiruvananthapuram Tiruchirapalli Vijayawada Visakhapatnam Trending on The Hindu India News Ratan Tata passes away LIVE News J & K Election results LIVE Indian men’s team wins rapid fire pistol gold Himachal CM says no toilet tax in State Google says it will stop linking to New Zealand news if a law passes forcing it to pay for content West Bengal junior doctors continue sit-in Google tests verified check marks in search results Jugaad vs sustainable education Trending on Group sites Stock Market Live Updates Stocks to buy today IND vs BAN Mogun Bagan Paralympics 2024 Gold Rate Today Silver Rate Today Sexual Harassment in Telugu Film Industry Mango: The Michael Jackson of Fruits Frontline Current Issue Terms of Use Privacy Policy Copyright© 2024, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

The news emerged yesterday as Huhne offered to pay less than a quarter of the £108,000 that prosecutors want him to cough up towards the costs of bringing him to justice. They told a court the costs were so high because the multi-millionaire former Cabinet minister chose to run a dishonest defence. But Huhne, 58, claims he should not have to meet the full taxpayer-funded bill and his barrister said he is willing to pay only £25,000. He and 60-year-old Pryce were jailed on March 11 for perverting the course of justice after she took speeding points for him in 2003 so that he could avoid a driving ban. This was seven years before their marriage collapsed over his affair with Carina Trimingham. Sources close to the former Liberal Democrat MP expect him to be released on May 13, but they added that his freedom could be delayed because of an administrative backlog of prisoners waiting to be released.  Pryce is likely to be freed on the same day – after they have served only a quarter of their sentences. They will probably be forced to wear an electronic tag and obey a night-time curfew on their release under a scheme for non-violent prisoners. For sentences of less than a year, offenders are automatically released after serving half their sentence. In addition, offenders serving sentences of between three months and four years, with exceptions for violent and sexual offenders, may also be eligible for release on a home detention curfew. This allows offenders to be freed up to 135 days before their automatic release date. Huhne returned yesterday to Southwark Crown Court, where he was jailed, to fight an attempt by the Crown Prosecution Service to get him to pay £108,539 towards the cost of bringing him to justice. Wearing an unironed shirt and looking gaunt with unkempt hair, he  listened intently during the three-hour hearing. Huhne was watched closely by Miss Trimingham and his father, Peter. He was brought by van from Leyhill open prison in Gloucestershire. RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 2 Next We don't work hard enough, claims MP Margaret Hodge as...

Share this article Share Huhne sensationally pleaded guilty on the morning of what would have been their joint trial for perverting the course of justice. Pryce, an economics professor, was convicted after a retrial because the original jury could not reach a verdict. She is in East Sutton Park open prison in Kent. The costs bill is high because more than a dozen legal hearings were held before the trial as Huhne tried to get the case thrown out. It includes the £31,000 cost of a laborious and time-consuming police inquiry he instigated with false claims of corruption among investigators. Disgraced: Chris Huhne, pictured in February, before he was sent to jail, has been hit with a claim for more than £100,000 costs over his attempts to get his speeding points case thrown out of court Hell hath no fury... Huhne's ex-wife Vicky Pryce, left, faces a claim for nearly £50,000 over the case. The former cabinet minister's love Carina Trimingham, right, was in court to support him today Prosecutor Andrew Edis, QC, attacked Huhne for failing to pay and said the scale of the costs was entirely his fault. He said the ex-politician wanted to run a dishonest defence alleging that Pryce’s claim that he made her take his speeding points was a ‘lie’. Mr Edis said: ‘But it was not a lie, it was true and Mr Huhne always knew that. We do submit, as to costs, that that is serious misconduct.’ The court heard the last-minute inquiry by Kent Police was undertaken at Huhne’s ‘strident insistence’ amid claims he could not receive a fair trial otherwise. It included the fruitless trawl of every single phone call made out of a police station over several weeks. Mr Edis said: ‘All of this occurred because Mr Huhne decided to do everything he could to try and get away with what he had done. ‘He gave in only at the last minute when defeat was inevitable. That is why this bill has been incurred.’ Huhne’s barrister, John Kelsey-Fry, QC, who commands up to £20,000 a day, accused the authorities of ‘rewriting history’. He claimed his client’s actions had in fact helped police get to the bottom of the case. Mr Kelsey-Fry said Huhne is prepared to pay a ‘reasonable, indeed arguably generous figure’ of £25,000. Mr Justice Sweeney will publish his ruling on costs next week. Share or comment on this article:

"Western targets in Libya face growing Islamist threat, diplomats warn - UPI.com Top News U.S. News World News Featured Odd News Entertainment Movies Music TV Science Health Sports NFL MLB NBA Soccer Voices Photos News US News World News Entertainment Sports Archive Almanac Advertisement World News April 29, 2013 / 3:00 AM New anti-West Islamist threats in Libya, diplomats say TRIPOLI, Libya, April 29 (UPI) -- Diplomats warned of growing anti-Western Islamist violence in Libya as jihadis ejected from Mali in the French-supported conflict moved into Libya. The diplomats did not single out the United States as a potential target but told the British newspaper The Guardian Western targets in general would likely be marked for terrorist attacks. Advertisement The warning followed a car-bomb explosion Tuesday that destroyed about half of the French Embassy in Tripoli, Libya's capital. The attack, which French and Libyan officials labeled terrorism, was the most significant attack against a Western interest in Libya since the Sept., 11, 2012, attack on the U.S. diplomatic mission at Benghazi that killed U.S. Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and three other Americans, The New York Times said. The embassy explosion 7 a.m. Tuesday injured two French guards, one critically, but most employees had not yet arrived, Libyan and French officials said. In Paris, President Francois Hollande said in a statement the bombing was ""aimed, by way of France, at all the countries of the international community engaged in the struggle against terrorism."" French troops began military operations against Islamists in Mali, a former French colony, Jan. 11. Forces from African Union states were deployed shortly after. Advertisement Within a month, Islamist-held territory in northern Mali was retaken by the Malian military, with the French-led coalition's help. The Islamist insurgent groups driven from northern Mali didn't just go away -- they fled across the Sahara to Libya, either through Algeria or Niger, both of which border Mali and Libya, the Western diplomats and Malian military officials told The Guardian. This influx is fueling a growing Islamist insurgency in Libya, the diplomats said. ""There are established links between groups in both Mali and Libya -- we know there are established routes,"" a Western diplomat told the newspaper. ""There is an anxiety among the political class here that Mali is blowing back on them,"" the diplomat in Tripoli said. ""The armed groups we are fighting are fleeing to Libya,"" Malian Col. Keba Sangare, commander of Mali's army garrison in Timbuktu, told The Guardian. ""We have captured Libyans in this region, as well as Algerians, Nigerians, French and other European dual-nationals,"" Sangare said. ""If you squeeze a balloon in one part, it bulges out in another,"" Bill Lawrence , a regional director of the non-profit anti-conflict International Crisis Group political consultancy, told The Guardian. ""There's no question that the French actions in Mali had the effect of squeezing that balloon toward Algeria and Libya,"" he said.

"Prenda lawyer to court: Don’t judge me for not talking - Ars Technica Skip to content Ars Technica home Sections Forum Subscribe AI Biz & IT Cars Culture Gaming Health Policy Science Security Space Tech Feature Reviews Store AI Biz & IT Cars Culture Gaming Health Policy Science Security Space Tech Forum Subscribe Theme Light Dark System Sign In Policy Prenda lawyer to court: Don’t judge me for not talking Paul Hansmeier says he wasn't in charge of Prenda suits. Who was? Who knows. Joe Mullin – Apr 9, 2013 7:50 pm Credit: Lourdes Nightingale / flickr Credit: Lourdes Nightingale / flickr 87 Last week, all the lawyers involved in the Prenda Law debacle showed up to federal court in Los Angeles—and said nothing. Instead, they choose to plead the Fifth. The judge ended the hearing in less than 20 minutes, storming off and saying he would draw his own conclusions about the lawyers involved in the copyright-trolling operation. Prenda is a legal firm that has used questionable tactics in suing people they allege to have illegally downloaded porn titles, and it has found itself under scrutiny over the past few months for its potentially extortionate practices. That scrutiny has intensified since it was discovered that two of Prenda's clients, AF Holdings and Ingenuity 13, could not confirm the existence of one man that appeared to lead both companies: Alan Cooper. Key Prenda lawyer Paul Hansmeier, like his colleague John Steele, lawyered up and refused to talk at the April 2 hearing. Today Hansmeier filed his response on paper, attempting to explain why he shouldn't be sanctioned despite the fact that he's not willing to shed much light on the whole situation Prenda Law finds itself in. ""Hansmeier's invocation of the Fifth Amendment may not be use[d] to formulate presumptions against him,"" because the court has ""raised questions of fraud and potential incarceration,"" states Hansmeier's lawyer in the response. When US District Judge Otis Wright chose to focus his attention in the ""Ingenuity 13"" case on attorney misconduct rather than intellectual property rights, the matter became more similar to a criminal proceeding than a civil one, Hansmeier argues. The brief directly takes on Wright's assertion that he'll assume the worst based on the non-answers coming from Team Prenda. And there's no justification for sanctions, argues Hansmeier's lawyer, Philip Baker. What was Brett Gibbs up to? No idea. ""There is simply no tie between Hansmeier and the issues raised within the court's order to show cause,"" writes Baker. As for Gibbs, the lawyer who was on-record as representing Ingenuity 13, he ""was neither employed nor supervised by Hansmeier in connection with this matter."" That means that Wright shouldn't sanction Hansmeier, Baker says, either under Rule 11 (the section of the federal litigation rules related to attorney misconduct) or under his ""inherent powers"" as a federal judge. Sanctions would be ""inappropriate"" since Hansmeier wasn't supervising Gibbs in any way and never ""had any malicious intent or otherwise acted in bad faith"" regarding any of the activities in Judge Wright's order. Who's Alan Cooper? Who owns AF Holdings? No idea. One of the key points in Judge Wright's order is that he wants more information about the allegations of identity theft related to Alan Cooper. In another remarkable recent filing in the Ingenuity 13 case, Prenda lawyers have accused Cooper of being mentally ill. Hansmeier says he's had no contact with Alan Cooper and ""played no role in the acquisition of Cooper's signatures"" on the corporate documents. And ""there is no evidence that Hansmeier obtained or represented that the signatures on the assignments over the name Alan Cooper were those of John Steele's former caretaker, who bears that same name and provided testimony to the court."" But that doesn't answer one of Judge Wright's key questions, which is whether or not there is more than one Alan Cooper. Hansmeier also dodges the question of who has any financial interest in AF Holdings or Ingenuity 13. He cheekily states that ""the duty to disclose a financial interest is necessary for a single purpose, to allow the court to determine whether it is necessary to disqualify or recuse itself."" ""The only evidence given regarding the financial interests to AF Holdings is that it is a limited liability company formed by Aisha Sargeant in May 2011 and is wholly owned by a trust with no defined beneficiaries. There is no evidence that Hansmeier has an ownership interest in either AF Holdings or Ingenuity 13."" Of course, the reason there is no evidence about who owns AF Holdings is because Hansmeier himself won't cough up the information. In his deposition , he called it an ""undefined beneficiary trust"" and said he couldn't name a single owner of it—despite the fact that, according to AF Holdings, Paul Hansmeier is the most qualified person to discuss the business of AF Holdings. Hansmeier similarly dodges other key questions in the response he filed today. Why didn't he notify the court about related cases? There's ""no evidence [he] participated in the decision""—it was all Gibbs. Why didn't he show up to the March 11 hearing? He didn't get enough time. He was served on March 7, ""less than two business days before the hearing.""

Media requires JavaScript to play. 24 April 2013 Last updated at 14:11 Help MEPs have rejected a proposal from the European Commission for an EU-wide agreement on the use of air passenger data for counter-terrorism measures. Airlines currently collect data - known as Passenger Name Records (PNR) - from passengers during reservation and check-in procedures. The European Commission has proposed that EU countries should be given the data of passengers leaving or entering the EU for use in investigating crime and terrorism allegations. But the proposal was rejected by 30 votes to 25 on the Civil Liberties Committee, despite the parliament's lead negotiator - or rapporteur - British Conservative Timothy Kirkhope urging his colleagues on the committee to support the Commission's position. He criticised the result of the vote, saying that counter-terrorism efforts in the EU ""have now been put back by years"". A number of EU countries already have their own rules on PNR, and Mr Kirkhope said that ""each country doing their own thing in their own way does not protect anyone in Europe"". But Dutch Liberal MEP Sophie In 't Veld welcomed the rejection saying that it did not mean that the committee was opposed to fighting terrorism. She insisted that it was wrong for the Commission to bring in laws on PNR before they finalise a new EU-wide directive on data protection, which is currently being negotiated. Mr Kirkhope said he now wanted a speedy plenary vote, saying the PNR proposals may face ""a more objective approach"". But the committee chair, Juan Lopez Aguilar said he would put the matter to the conference of presidents - made up of the leaders of the political groups - to decide how to proceed.

T he Congress and P C Chacko, chairman of Joint Parliamentary Committee probing the 2G spectrum allocation scam, have done the impossible task: to unite the opposition against it as never before. So much so that archrivals like the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagham and the DMK, the Trinamool Congress and the Left, and the BJP -- all came together, met Lok Sabha Speaker Meira Kumar and demanded Chacko’s removal. The 15 opposition members of the JPC met the speaker and later were hosted for lunch by Biju Janata Dal member of the JPC, Arjun Charan Sethi, in a move which spells political trouble for the Congress party. Those who did not sign include the Congress, the Nationalist Congress Party, the Samajwadi Party and the Bahujan Samaj Party, with the remaining political parties going against the Congress and the manner in which a ‘clean chit’ was given to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Finance Minister P Chidambaram in the JPC draft report. What was even more interesting was AIADMK supremo J Jayalalithaa, who was critical against then Telecom Minister A Raja, also sided with the DMK in opposing the Congress party. The Congress later hit back with six of its members writing to Speaker Meira Kumar demanding that BJP’s Yashwant Sinha, Jaswant Singh and Ravi Shanker Prasad should be removed from the JPC citing conflict of interest as “they have been associated with telecom decisions in the past”. Analysts say that if the “conflict” was of a serious nature, the Congress should have raised the objection when they were first appointed to the JPC, and not at this stage when the committee is concluding its deliberations. The BJP’s main objection is to why former prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee has been dragged into the entire issue. He said it is not only the opposition parties’ responsibility to run the house and was non committal on whether the opposition would allow Parliament to function for some time, at least to pass the finance bill. Thursday’s scheduled meeting of the JPC to pass the draft report was cancelled as Lok Sabha member of Trinamool Congress, Ambica Banerjee, passed away earlier in the day and the House was adjourned. But with both sides at war, it was doubtful whether the meeting could have been held at all. The JPC has 30 members including the chairman, and with 15 members having expressed “no-confidence” in P C Chacko, the arithmetic has become a little dicey. The term of the JPC ends on May 10, which is also the last day of the Budget Session of the Parliament. So while an extension is ruled out, there appears to be no way of sorting out the mess which the JPC has landed itself in. While one side would claim the report has been accepted, the opposition would say it has been rejected since the numbers are evenly balanced out at the moment. Even if Congress legally wins the case in JPC, the credibility of its draft report will always be doubted. Soon after the House was adjourned, senior Congress leaders went into a huddle led by party president Sonia Gandhi, and Chacko, Kamal Nath and Sushilkumar Shinde, other members of the core committee, were called in the meeting. Senior Congress leaders admit that the party miscalculated as the idea was to push through the draft report, but the matter was badly handled and boomeranged against the party. In the process Congress ended up ensuring that warring political parties came together against them, sending out a message of opposition unity with BJP having the loudest voice.

That seems to be the case, except in regard to one site – the Temple Mount, from which Feiglin has been essentially banned. The reason for this, the Justice Ministry said Monday, was because Feiglin's “behavior ” was not in line with what was expected from a Knesset member. “We have decided to prevent MK Feiglin from ascending the Temple Mount based on his previous behavior . As a result we have informed MK Feiglin that we do not intend to coordinate a visit for him to the Temple Mount with police.” The decision, according to the Ministry, was taken by its highest echelons and was authorized by Attorney General Yehuda Weinstein, as well as top police officials. “The police, security, and judiciary all have a list of reasons to prevent MK Feiglin from ascending the Temple Mount. Allowing him to do so is likely to cause potential security damage to the state. As such, we have issued this directive,” the Ministry said. The statement came as Feiglin was preparing for his monthly visit to the Mount. Feiglin received the message late Sunday, hours before he planned to visit the Mount. The Temple Mount Organizations lobby group, which represents individuals and groups lobbying for free access to the Mount, accused Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu of being behind the Feiglin ban, and called for a criminal investigation against the Prime Minister.

On Sunday, a large number of militants were killed during intense clashes with Syrian soldiers as government forces sought to flush armed men out of villages surrounding al-Qusayr, which is situated about 35 kilometers (22 miles) south of the western city of Homs, Syria's official news agency SANA reported. The Syrian forces also thwarted an attack by a group of gunmen against the Daba'a military airbase near al-Qusayr. The gunmen attempted to enter the airbase but were forced to flee. On April 20, Syrian troops established total control on the villages of al-Radwanieh, al-Saadieh and al-Burhanieh, al-Mansourieh and al-Sukmanieh in the countryside of al-Qusayr. Meanwhile, Syrian soldiers killed dozens of militants on the outskirts of the capital, Damascus, on Sunday as the army continues mop-up operations in the area. Several international human rights organizations have stated that the foreign-backed militant groups are committing war crimes in Syria. UN Undersecretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator Valerie Amos and High Commissioner for Refugees Antonio Guterres told the Security Council on April 18 that a quarter of Syria's 22 million people are displaced within the country and 1.3 million have fled to other states in the Middle East and North Africa. ""Children are among the ones who suffer most. Children have been murdered, tortured and subjected to sexual violence. Many do not have enough food to eat. Millions have been traumatized by the horrors,"" Amos said.

April 22, 2013 Man Wearing Novelty T-Shirt Arrested For Refusing To Leave South Carolina Park Comments( ) Share Tweet A man wearing a novelty t-shirt with a sexually charged message was arrested Saturday after refusing a police order to leave a South Carolina park due to “the shirt with that phrase on it,” according to investigators. Michael Miller, 50, was spotted “with a shirt that read ‘I May Not Be Mr. Right But I’ll Fuck You ‘Til He Shows Up,’” according to a Spartanburg Department of Public Safety report . As seen above, a shirt with that message sells for $19.99 at the Spencer’s gift store chain. When cops approached Miller and told him that he was not allowed to wear the shirt in Spartanburg’s Barnet Park, he reportedly became irate and “said he would wear the shirt any fucking where he wanted to.” Miller was then issued a trespass warning “from Barnet Park during the Rock the Denim event,” a yearly concert that is devoted to raising awareness of sexual violence against women. After refusing to leave the park, Miller--who cursed at and gave the finger to cops--was busted for disorderly conduct. He was released from custody Saturday evening after posting a $262 bond. When posing for his booking photo, Miller (seen above) was wearing an orange jail smock, not his “Mr. Right” t-shirt.

The officials said the Americans were killed on Saturday, making it the deadliest day for the US-led war in eight months. The officials said that three US troops and two civilians were killed when a car bomber ambushed a convoy of US-led NATO forces in the south. One Afghan doctor was also killed in the attack. A US official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that at least one of the victims was a US State Department employee. The official also said that about nine other Americans and Afghans were injured during the attack. Another American national was also killed in a separate Taliban attack in eastern Afghanistan, the US military said in a statement. The American Embassy in Kabul confirmed that US nationals were killed in an attack in Qalat, the capital of Zabul province, but did not provide further details. 'There are American and Afghan casualties,' the embassy said in a statement. 'We are still investigating the incident and cannot confirm details at this time.' Taliban spokesman Qari Yousef Ahmadi claimed responsibility for the Zabul assault. On August 16, seven American troops were killed in two attacks in Kandahar province. Six lost their lives when Taliban militants shot down their helicopter and one soldier was killed in a roadside bombing. According to the website icasualties.org, a total of 30 foreign troops, including 24 US soldiers, have lost their lives in Afghanistan so far this year. Six foreign civilians also died in Afghanistan in 2013. A total of 3,279 foreign soldiers have been killed in Afghanistan since the US-led war began in 2001. The increasing number of military casualties in Afghanistan has caused widespread anger in the US and other NATO member states, undermining public support for the Afghan war. The US-led war in Afghanistan began in October 2001. The offensive removed the Taliban from power, but insecurity continues to rise across Afghanistan, despite the presence of about 100,000 US-led troops.

Now U.S. lawmakers are calling on President Obama to take stronger action . But what should he do? The most pressing problem seems to be the displacement of hundreds of thousands of Syrians . The generosity of Syria’s neighbors may be reaching its limit. What’s the best way to deal with the growing refugee crisis in the region?

Established in 1970, when the budding environmentalist movement met with high fuel prices and air pollution, the Earth Day has become a day to focus on better practices to preserve the health of the natural world and reduce human impact on it. Earth Day's official web page says the day was established in 1970 by U.S. Senator Gaylord Nelson after he witnessed the ravages of the 1969 oil spill in Santa Barbara, California. Protesters against the Vietnam War also used the day as a chance to promote their cause. Many Earth Day events are locally generated, and in many cases they involve community cleanup efforts at beaches, river watersheds, or other natural areas. In Washington, residents are taking part in an effort to clean up the litter around the Anacostia River, a chronically polluted area. On the U.S. National Mall, students have been competing in a contest for environmental improvement programs. In Veracruz, Mexico, volunteers are cleaning beaches and have organized a reforestation campaign. In Jalandhar, India, a local organization has distributed free tree saplings to students for planting. And in Seoul, South Korea - home to Gangnam Style pop sensation Psy - environmental advocates organized a dance event in which participants form a ""flash mob"" in response to a Gangnam Style song variation dubbed ""Eco-style.""

"Knox mulling return to Italy for murder retrial | South China Morning Post Advertisement World Knox mulling return to Italy for murder retrial Reading Time: 2 minutes Why you can trust SCMP AFP Published: 5:24pm, 30 Apr 2013 Amanda Knox has refused to rule out returning to Italy for her murder retrial in the grisly 2007 slaying of her British house-mate, USA Today reported on its website on Tuesday. Advertisement Knox, 25, was ordered to stand trial again by Italian authorities last month in the latest twist of the legal saga which had seen her acquitted on appeal in 2011 following her earlier conviction. The American student and her former Italian boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito had originally been sentenced to 26 years and 25 years in prison for the killing of Meredith Kercher six years ago. Although legal analysts expected Knox to be tried again in absentia following the decision in March to order a new trial, the former student told USA Today in an interview she was “considering” returning to Italy. Advertisement “My lawyers have said that I don’t have to and that I don’t need to. I’m still considering it, to be honest,” she was quoted as saying when asked if she planned to return to Italy. “It’s scary, the thought. But it’s also important for me to say, ‘This is not just happening far away from and doesn’t matter to me.’ Advertisement","Knox, 25, was ordered to stand trial again by Italian authorities last month in the latest twist of the legal saga.

The American student and her former Italian boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito had originally been convicted of murder. But a court overturned the verdict and ordered a new trial after the DNA evidence found on the knife used to kill Meredith Kercher was re-examined.
The Italian Supreme Court ordered a new trial for Knox, who was convicted of the 2007 murder of her British flatmate in 2009. A court in Perugia, Italy, found Knox and Sollecito guilty of the 2007 murder of 21-year-old Meredith Kercher, who was found stabbed to death in her bedroom. A third suspect, Rudy Guede, was convicted separately.
Now, Italy’s Supreme Court has ordered that the trial be held again to determine whether or not Knox was the person who killed the 21-year-old British student.

Kurtis Peterson, 36, was sentenced to between one and 15 years by judge Timothy Hicks, according to Michigan Live. Advertisement Hicks seemed to be worried the man from Muskegon was a risk to repeat the offense. “I fear for what he might do in the community,” Hicks said during the sentencing hearing.

No reporters from either country will attend the trial as it stands. Several key figures have called for that to change. https://p.dw.com/p/18EYN Image: picture-alliance/dpa Advertisement Turkish President Abdullah Gül lent his voice to an ongoing debate about journalist representation at one of Germany's highest-profile post-war court cases when Economy Minister Philipp Rösler visited Ankara on Thursday. Several German news outlets, citing participants in the closed-door talks, reported that Gül had called for Turkish media representation at the trial in Munich. The reports, which also said Gül expressed his confidence in the German legal system, only paraphrased the president. Rösler was reported as saying that the more open the trial, the better it would be for Germany. Four people are on trial for their roles in 10 murders committed by the far-right National Socialist Underground cell between 2000 and 2007. Eight of the victims were ethnic Turks, another hailed from Greece and the tenth was a German policewoman. The Munich court has so far stuck rigidly to protocol. Following its usual procedure, the court issued the 50 available journalists' accreditations on a ""first come, first served"" basis - in order to avoid violating anti-discrimination laws. No Turkish or Greek outlets were among the first 50 outlets to apply, the vast majority of which were German. One suggested solution was to pick a larger courtroom Image: Reuters Despite the trial being one of the most sensitive and high profile in post-war German history, a venue with only 100 seats for the public and press - split evenly between the two - has been selected. Similar concerns have been voiced by civilians with a vested interest in attending, who are also subject to the first come, first served system. The court has since said that this standardized process cannot be altered for any case, and that all accreditations are non-transferrable. German mass-circulation daily ""Bild"" had offered to give its spot at the trial to the comparable Turkish ""Hürriyet"" newspaper, which also publishes a European edition available on German news stands. Other media groups followed Bild with similar offers. Bundestag, journalists' union join fray Another pair of proposed solutions, either moving to a larger venue or offering a ""livestream"" of audio and video from the court in another location, has so far been rejected by the court. A group of 55 parliamentarians from Germany's lower house, the Bundestag, focused on the suitability of the courtroom in a joint appeal issued on Thursday. ""It is not the task of public and press interest in the unique case to adapt to the size of the room that has been allocated, but rather the reverse: The major interest must be granted the requisite space,"" the parliamentarians said in a statement. The federal government has already voiced its ""hopes"" for a ""sensitive"" solution to the situation, albeit simultaneously stressing that the decision must lie with the independent German judiciary. The Deutscher Journalisten-Verband (German Federation of Journalists) said Thursday that one solution might be to scrap the existing accreditation process altogether and start from scratch. The case is scheduled to open on Wednesday, April 17. One 38-year-old woman, Beate Zschäpe - the only alleged core member of the cell still alive - and four alleged accomplices are on trial. German authorities were already somewhat on the back foot with regard to the alleged NSU murders. The neo-Nazi group was uncovered by chance after a botched bank robbery led police to the cell at the end of 2011. Prior to this, investigators had mooted that the killings might be tied to organized crime among immigrant communities - not German far-right radicals. The backlash from the case led either directly or indirectly to leadership reshuffles at the federal and at some regional German domestic intelligence agencies, as news of missing files and investigative irregularities surfaced after the NSU's discovery. msh/ccp (AFP, dpa) Send us your feedback Your feedback Advertisement Skip next section Explore more Explore more Turkish media takes aim at German officials Turkish media takes aim at German officials Turkish politicians and media are criticizing German authorities on two fronts: for a neo-Nazi pre-court debacle and investigations into fires that injured Turks in Germany.

"Spanish police charge Dutchman Sven Olaf Kamphuis in cyberattack - UPI.com Top News U.S. News World News Featured Odd News Entertainment Movies Music TV Science Health Sports NFL MLB NBA Soccer Voices Photos News US News World News Entertainment Sports Archive Almanac Advertisement Technology April 29, 2013 / 10:24 AM Dutchman Kamphuis arrested in massive cyberattack on anti-spam site BARCELONA, Spain, April 29 (UPI) -- A Dutch citizen was arrested in Spain in what officials called the world's largest cyberattack. Sven Olaf Kamphuis is accused of launching a distributed denial-of-service attack on Spamhaus, a non-profit organization that detects spam email at its source and blocks it, ThinkSpain reported Sunday. Advertisement Kamphuis, 35, is reported to be the manager of Cyberbunker and organizer of the group Stophaus. Authorities said he traveled all over Spain in a van equipped with antennas that allowed him to stage the attacks without being tracked. Maria Buyo, a representative of the National Police in Barcelona, said authorities in the Netherlands had begun investigating the cyberattack after huge amounts of data were sent to the anti-spam site in an attempt to shut it down. Buyo said the cyberattack slowed the Internet around the world. Authorities alleged that Kamphuis staged the attack because Spamhaus had blocked a number of servers hosted by Cyberbunker. Kamphuis told the media that Spamhaus ""did not have the right"" to choose ""what should and should not"" be on the Web.

Some activists are trying to change that By Tracy Clark-Flory Published April 7, 2013 1:00AM (EDT) ( James Brey via iStock /Salon) -- Shares Facebook Twitter Reddit Email Imagine a woman does a Google search on her own name and up comes a page featuring a naked photo that she sent to an ex-boyfriend. There are links to her Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn account. In the comment thread, anonymous trolls critique every inch of her body. Perhaps her home phone number and address are also included. Say she contacts the local police in tears, only to be told that the post is perfectly legal -- or worse, that “boys will be boys.” This is becoming an increasingly common scenario, activists say, given the proliferation of “revenge porn"" and the legal system's failure to catch up with it. A new bill in Florida is aiming to remedy that: It would make it a felony to publish online nude photos or videos of a person without their permission and along with identifying information. At the same time, activists around the country are petitioning for both state and federal laws to criminalize what they call “non-consensual porn.” A recent class action lawsuit filed by more than 20 women in Texas against revenge porn site Texxxan.com along with its host GoDaddy has only turned the heat up on the issue. It isn’t that victims are currently without recourse. “There are lots of laws that we can use on the civil side, from invasion of privacy to emotional distress to harassment and stalking,” says Erica Johnstone, co-founder of the nonprofit Without My Consent. There are problems with that approach, though. The Communications Decency Act protects website operators from liability for content submitted by outside parties; and most revenge porn sites are driven by submissions from users. What's more, the content in question is usually posted anonymously, so a subpoena is required for the website to reveal the IP address of the person who posted it. In the interest of preventing the plaintiff’s identity from entering court record, the case is typically filed as a Doe v. Doe lawsuit. “Presenting that to a state court is a new strategy that many state courts have not seen before and don’t necessarily know where to look in terms of precedent and guidance,” says Johnstone. That isn’t to mention the cost: “It can cost tens of thousands before even proceeding to a judgment,” she says. Even in the case of a default judgment, she says, “These defendants are often judgment proof. They’re just basement-dwellers.” In other words, “they have nothing to lose, which is why they engage in this behavior in the first place,” she says. So, you might end up with a six-figure judgment that the plaintiff can never collect. There’s much more leverage with criminal prosecution. “Even if people aren’t afraid of being sued because they have nothing to lose, they are afraid of being convicted of a crime because that shows up on their record forever,” says Johnstone. “A lot of times it’s the police and district attorneys that really have the leverage to stop this kind of behavior.” But many don’t even realize it, says Danielle Citron, a law professor at the University of Maryland. “There are laws that we could enforce,” she says. “They could be pursued, but cops don't understand, they aren't trained. They just want women to turn off their computers.” It’s generally the victims who take their case all the way to the state legislature who see any progress in their case. On the surface, the Florida bill seems a major step in the right direction, but several anti-revenge-porn activists are unsatisfied with it. Mary Anne Franks, a law professor at the University of Miami, says that the bill does get one thing right: “It's very good that it recognizes what I call ‘contextual consent’ -- the fact that a person might consent to be photographed or filmed in one context but not in another.” In other words, when a woman consents to having her boyfriend take a naked photo of her for his own enjoyment, she isn’t consenting to having him publish the shot on the Internet with links to her Facebook and LinkedIn profiles. But she says the law is ultimately “both too broad and too narrow.” For example, the bill applies to ""any photograph or video of an individual which depicts nudity,” but doesn't define nudity. It’s “an extremely broad formulation that could potentially include a photograph of someone standing next to a picture of Botticelli's Venus,"" says Franks. At the same time, it’s “a narrow definition, in that it would presumably not apply to depictions of graphic sexual activity unless certain parts of the body are visible,” she says. Franks tells me of an actual case in which a man ejaculated on his sleeping girlfriend’s face and then uploaded pictures to the Internet -- that would not violate Florida’s law. The bill also makes exceptions for photos or video taken in public. “If a woman's skirt blows up in the wind and she is not wearing anything underneath, can an image of her be posted to an upskirt porn site?” asks Franks. “What about mothers breast-feeding in public? Is a public bathroom public? What about a changing room in a department store?” There’s a tricky balancing act to be done here to adequately addressing the revenge porn problem without violating the First Amendment. “There’s a very fine line between invasion of privacy and free speech,” Johnstone says. Frank and other activists point to New Jersey's criminal invasion of privacy statute, which was used successfully in the Tyler Clementi case , as a good blueprint. The law criminalizes the photographing or filming and distribution of “the image of another person whose intimate parts are exposed or who is engaged in an act of sexual penetration or sexual contact, without that person's consent and under circumstances in which a reasonable person would not expect to be observed.” Frank points out that both federal and state laws already take it very seriously that pornography should be restricted to adults. As she wrote on the law blog Concurring Opinion, “It is time they took consent requirements seriously as well.” By Tracy Clark-Flory MORE FROM Tracy Clark-Flory Related Topics ------------------------------------------ Editor's Picks Love And Sex Pornography Revenge Porn Sex Related Articles Advertisement: Home About Staff Contact Privacy Terms of Service Archive Go Ad Free Copyright © 2024 Salon.com, LLC.

Eliran Aharon, New York May 1, 2013, 5:01 AM (GMT+3) America Columbia University boycotts BDS Prof. Brinkley Messick Eliran Aharon Several dozen professors and lecturers at Columbia University in New York are calling to divest their pension funds from companies that do business with Israelis in Judea and Samaria (Shomron). Arutz Sheva’s Yoni Kempinski spoke to one of them and asked why. Professor of Anthropology Brinkley Messick explained what he sees as a “very limited, very targeted moral campaign” to divest from a group of five companies. When asked about the scope of the campaign of “boycott, divestment and sanctions” from Israel, he said, “The campaign is definitely growing. It’s growing very very strongly…. This is something that’s at many American colleges and universities, both the faculty and the students.” Messick noted a similar campaign on University of California system campuses. When asked why there do not appear to be similar campaigns against countries that violate human rights to the point of massive murder of civilians, such as Syria and North Korea, Messick said, “People oppose all sorts of oppressive regimes, in all sorts of contemporary colonial circumstances. This is one that has world implications.” Arutz Sheva also asked what the boycotters’ problem with Israel is, why they do not see Israel’s court system as the place to seek redress for alleged land theft, as Arabs do, and whether they hope to see boycotted companies collapse – a result that would impact the Palestinian Authority and the many Arabs who are employed by them, as well as Israel, if not more so.

The Vatican released a statement saying that Pope Francis is praying for the safety of the kidnapped prelates and praying also that ""the Syrian people may finally see tangible responses to the humanitarian drama and real hopes of peace and reconciliation rise on the horizon."" The statement noted that the abductions were ""a dramatic confirmation of the tragic situation in which the Syrian population and its Christian community is living.""

Thousands of candidates competed for the estimated 400 seats in last weekend's provincial council elections in Iraq. Violence rocked the country the week ahead of the vote, though Election Day was relatively peaceful. Advertisement The European Union said provincial council elections, the first since U.S. forces left the country, helped secure democratic principles in Iraq. It expressed concern, however, that the security situation prevented a vote in Anbar and Nineveh provinces. Political tensions in Iraq erupted shortly after U.S. forces left the country in December 2011. A protest movement has developed in Sunni-dominated Anbar against Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki , a Shiite. In a statement, the European Union ""calls on the government of Iraq and all Iraq's political forces to engage in an inclusive and genuine dialogue to address grievances and resolve political differences."" The New York Times reported Tuesday that Iraqi forces stormed a Sunni protest encampment in Kirkuk in northern Iraq. At least 33 civilians died in the attack. Tuesday's fighting in Kirkuk was the single deadliest incident in Sunni-led protests against Maliki. Advertisement Sunni groups in Anbar and Salahuddin provinces began mobilizing after Tuesday's violence, declaring war on the Maliki government, the Times reported.

Some critics called the new system a ""raffle"" - one that may be unconstitutional. https://p.dw.com/p/18PSz Image: picture-alliance/dpa Advertisement The deputy editor-in-chief of the Turkish newspaper, ""Sabah,"" Ismail Erel, is both happy and relieved. His paper can now report first-hand on the trial of the right-wing extremist terror group National Socialist Underground (NSU), which begins on May 6 at Bavaria's highest court in Munich. ""Of course we're happy about that - that we got one of the accredited media seats through the luck of the draw,"" Erel told the German Press Agency (dpa) after seats were distributed on Monday (29.03.13). The presence of ""Sabah"" at the NSU trial is a twist of fate that strikes many as being just. From the start, the newspaper had the courage to challenge the constitutionality of the Bavarian state court's controversial media accreditation process. Initially, the Munich court had awarded the 50 seats on a ""first-come, first-served"" basis. No Turkish media were quick enough to obtain one of the seats, and the same was true for nearly all foreign media. At Germany's Federal Constitutional Court in the city of Karlsruhe, judges ultimately ruled against the Munich court's accreditation process and in favor of the plaintiffs. A number of seats were allotted for foreign - and particularly Turkish - members of the press. Of the ten victims allegedly murdered by the NSU, eight had Turkish roots and another, Greek. Luck of the draw For its second round of the media accreditation process, then, the Munich court decided on a rather complicated lottery system. Seats were apportioned into categories including print media, radio, television and news agencies. To see just how lucky ""Sabah"" and the other selected media are, one only has to look at the numbers. For the sub-group ""Media published in Turkish,"" four seats were reserved. Thirty-six applications were received. No wonder, then, that even before the official drawing, which was performed by a notary official, the word ""raffle"" was making the rounds to describe the procedure. The headline, ""Turkish Press not wanted,"" was one of many expressing disappointment after the first accreditation Image: picture-alliance/dpa In spite of his own delight at having been chosen, ""Sabah"" journalist Erel sympathizes with those who now find themselves on the other side of the fence. ""I can understand the disappointment of the media that were chosen the first time round and now aren't in there,"" Erel told dpa. The German press agency itself was lucky twice over: first, in that it obtained a seat for German-language media, and second, in that it also obtained one for English media. The news agency publishes content in both languages. Among those who lost out in the second accreditation process - having previously obtained seats in the first - were many of Germany's household names. Well-known media like ""Zeit,"" ""Stern,"" ""Tagesspiegel"" and ""Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung"" will not be given seats at the trial. ""…and the Lord taketh"" One lost seat belonged to freelance journalist Martin Lejeune. Shortly after losing out in the second round, the Berlin native sent a letter via his lawyer, challenging the constitutionality of the ""lottery"" system. Over the course of approximately 20 pages, the journalist describes why he believes he has been unfairly deprived of a seat. The highest judge at the Munich court, Lejeune claims, has overlooked the fact that ""a seat that was previously and successfully awarded to a journalist cannot simply be taken away again."" Prior to the first accreditation process, the courtroom's media chamber had already been criticized as too small given the worldwide media attention being paid to the trial. The Munich court then rejected a proposal which would have seen a second room be made available, including a live video feed of the proceedings. Doing so, the court signaled, would violate constitutional law. As a result, a potential legal challenge that was considered by Editor-in-Chief Ines Pohl at the ""Tageszeitung"" newspaper, which in the first accreditation process received the first spot due to its quick application turnaround, had little chance of success. The second time around, ""Tageszeitung"" finds itself among the more than 300 media that applied for - but failed to receive - accreditation. First in, then out: Martin Lejeune is challenging the legality of the Munich court's lottery system Image: privat Lejeune's lawyer, who is following through with a challenge in court, bases his argument on Article 5 of Germany's constitution, the Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany. Article 5, he claims, guarantees ""a right to information"" to the press - a principle that could be violated by the small size of the Munich courtroom. In his legal petition, the lawyer writes that Munich's top judge cannot simply operate by the principle of ""The Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away."" Media swaps In an interview with DW, Lejeune also stressed what he views as a material disadvantage. A seat at the trial would have allowed the freelancer to report on the entire legal proceedings of the case, whose trial is expected to last well into 2014. After the successful first accreditation process, Lejeune had established contact with other media that lacked representation at the trial, including Deutsche Welle. Like many other news sources, Deutsche Welle did not receive accreditation but was instead placed on a long waiting list to obtain access to the courtroom. In the second-round lottery, Deutsche Welle, together with Germany's other publicly-funded news sources, submitted a joint application to increase the chance of obtaining a ""shared"" seat at the trial. Unlike the first accreditation process, this time media working in conjunction with one another was expressly allowed. Each accredited journalist could ""at any time, in agreement with a medium that received a seat, take over that reserved seat,"" according to the written statement by the Munich court. Cooperation - and appreciation For many media, that's an acceptable compromise. For freelancer Martin Lejeune, it isn't. ""This arrangement provides, in an irresponsible way, for the encouragement of unrestricted commercialization,"" he criticized in his constitutional challenge. In other words, while seats are not for sale, interested and financially powerful media that did not receive a seat at the NSU trial could see very good reasons to find a way to buy access into the trial with the help of a ""third-party"" middleman. Lejeune's fears are well grounded. In the first round of accreditation, it would have been impossible for a journalist to ""give"" his or her seat to another person. Many media representatives, out of solidarity for their Turkish colleagues, had wanted to do just that. The German ""Abendzeitung"" newspaper, for example, would have happily given its seat to ""Sabah."" But the Munich court, on legal grounds, was unmoved by that proposition. With the current arrangement, the system is turned around. ""Sabah"" got lucky, while the ""Abendzeitung"" did not. As a result, the Turkish gazette has decided to cooperate with the German newspaper throughout the NSU trial. ""We owe that to our colleagues,"" said Deputy Editor-in-Chief Ismail Erel.

AFP/Getty Images Story highlights Henrique Capriles Radonski accuses election authorities of lying He says his next step is to contest the presidential vote with judicial authorities A new election should occur, Capriles says Maduro stresses that he won a majority of votes in the election CNN — Venezuelan opposition leader Henrique Capriles Radonski said Thursday that he will formally contest the South American country’s presidential vote “in the coming days.” In an interview with CNN affiliate Globovision, Capriles accused election authorities of lying to Venezuelans last week when they announced plans to complete a 100% audit of the election. A week later, he said, no such audit has started. That means contesting the election before judicial authorities is the next step, Capriles said. Last week Venezuelan election officials said Nicolas Maduro had secured 50.8% of votes in Venezuela’s April 14 presidential election while Capriles won 49%. newton venezuela casserole war_00015514.jpg video Related video Venezuela's casserole street protest ctw intv venezuela's amb to uk moncada_00024517.jpg video Related video Venezuelan amb.: Opposition is sore loser Venezuelan presidential candidate Henrique Capriles speaks during a press conference in Caracas on April 15, 2013.

AFP PHOTO/RONALDO SCHEMIDT (Photo credit should read Ronaldo Schemidt/AFP/Getty Images) Ronaldo Schemidt/AFP/Getty Images video Related video Capriles to Maduro: 'You are the loser' The narrow margin has sparked mounting tensions in Venezuela after the closely watched vote to pick a successor to Hugo Chavez, who died on March 5 after a long battle with cancer. On April 18, Venezuela’s National Electoral Council said it would complete 100% audit of votes cast in the election “to preserve a climate of harmony between Venezuelans.” The next day, Maduro was sworn in as president . Since the election results were announced, Capriles has called for a recount, alleged thousands of election irregularities and decried Maduro’s government as illegitimate. “According to the law,” he told Globovision on Thursday, “what should happen would be a new election, without any of the irregularities that we have denounced.” Maduro has accused Capriles and his supporters of inciting violence. In numerous public appearances and national television broadcasts, he’s vowed to use an iron fist to crack down on any coup attempts. In nationally broadcast remarks Thursday, Maduro stressed that he had won a clear majority of votes in the election.

The Russian president said afterwards that he had enjoyed their display. https://p.dw.com/p/18ByT Image: picture-alliance/dpa Advertisement President Vladimir Putin was pragmatic on Monday after three female protesters disrupted his tour of the world's largest industrial trade fair with German Chancellor Angela Merkel. The protesters, displaying a greater command of English expletives than grammar with the messages emblazoned on their breasts, referred to the Russian leader as a ""dictator,"" also shouting similar slogans. Bodyguards restrained them and took them away. ""Regarding this performance, I liked it,"" Putin said in a joint news conference with Merkel, adding ""I did not see anything terrible in [the protest], though I think … it is better to be dressed if one wants to discuss political matters."" Putin also said that ""without such an action there would be less talk about the show than with such an action."" The protesters represented the women's rights group Femen, which has staged protests around Europe against the detention of the feminist ""Pussy Riot"" band that posed for scenes in an anti-Putin music video in a Russian cathedral. Tensions, but not affecting trade Russia is this year's partner country for the Hanover Trade Fair, which runs through April 12. At an opening ceremony on Sunday, Merkel was also critical of the key German trade partner. Several non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in key Russian cities like Moscow and St Petersburg were subject to police raids in recent weeks, including German political foundations like the Konrad Adenauer Foundation and the Friedrich Ebert Foundation. ""A vibrant civil society can only emerge when individuals can operate without fear or worry, of course within the confines of the law,"" Merkel said. Putin responded by saying that Russia was ""monitoring financial flows"" going into these organizations, but not closing or forbidding them. Merkel was also keen to stress that Russia remained an ""important strategic partner"" for Germany. Government statistics show that Russia was Germany's tenth-largest trading partner in 2012. Unusually, Germany also spent more on imports from Russia than it earned from exports last year. msh/ccp (AFP, dpa, Reuters) Send us your feedback Your feedback Advertisement Skip next section Explore more Explore more Trade fair can't mask German-Russian tensions Trade fair can't mask German-Russian tensions Russia is the partner country for the 2013 Hannover Messe - the trade fair for the industrial sector.

Friday's report on Oman state TV gave no further details. Oman has served as a mediator between Washington and Tehran before. The scientist, Mojtaba Atarodi, was in U.S. custody since December 2011 over allegations he bought advanced technological equipment in violation of U.S. sanctions on Iran. Iran's official IRNA news agency said this week that the U.S. released Atarodi, a microchip expert at Tehran's Sharif University. In September 2011, two Americans convicted of espionage by Iran were freed and traveled to Oman, which also briefly hosted a third member of the group after her release a year earlier. The three Americans said they were hiking in northern Iraq and strayed across the Iranian border. True Crime The hottest stories ripped from the headlines, from crime to courts, legal and scandal.

Mike Rogers, R-Mich., faces a political dilemma. Does he continue his work as chairman of the House Intelligence Committee as it deals with thorny issues such as North Korea and nuclear weapons? Or does Rogers put all that on the back burner to run for a vacant Senate seat in 2014? ""It's a tough decision,"" Rogers told CNN's Jake Tapper. Being chairman is ""a huge responsibility, and the work is important and impactful."" Democratic Sen. Carl Levin is retiring and Republicans believe they can field a winning campaign. But last year's attempt to defeat Democratic Sen. Debbie Stabenow did not result in a GOP victory. Spencer Abraham was the last Republican to be elected U.S. senator from Michigan, in 1994, but he was defeated for a second term by Stabenow in 2000. Rogers, a seven-term congressman, leads in public opinion polls on Senate GOP candidates in Michigan. He told CNN he'd make a decision soon. It used to be that running for an open Senate seat was an automatic thing for sitting House members or governors. But the gig apparently has lost some luster — or at least has caused potential candidates to take their time studying whether it's right for them. This year, veteran GOP Rep. Tom Latham and ex-Democratic governor Tom Vilsack (the Agriculture secretary) have both taken a pass on running for the Senate in Iowa. Former Michigan governor Jennifer Granholm, a Democrat, said ""no"" to the Michigan race, and GOP Gov. Dave Heineman is undecided about a bid in Nebraska.

I write about how companies make money (or should be making money). Apr 26, 2013, 03:53pm EDT Updated Apr 26, 2013, 03:53pm EDT This article is more than 10 years old. Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin A hostess holds a new smartphone 'Ascend LTE with 4G' by Huawei at the 2013 Mobile World Congress in ... [+] Barcelona on February 26, 2013. The 2013 Mobile World Congress, the world's biggest mobile fair, is held from February 25 to 28 in Barcelona. (Image credit: AFP/Getty Images via @daylife) Salesforce.com 's Marc Benioff spoke at an event this week and, according to the Register, held forth on, among other topics, connected devices and how data from these devices can ultimately help drive sales. ""This idea – that everything is on the network and everything is wireless and everything is on these high-speed LTE networks – is the third wave of computing,"" Benioff said. ""It's transformational."" By connecting fridges, cars, TVs and so on, Benioff reportedly said, companies get better data on how products are being used, and can use this information to sell more items and learn more about how their business works. ""If I'm on Facebook , why is my car not my friend?"" he also reportedly said. This day is not long in coming. Some industry estimates say that by the end of 2014, most of the bigger auto brands will offer some kind of connectivity. Facebook--as Benioff note-- figures prominently in these plans, as do such providers as Intel , which is sinking millions into connected car research. But all I can think of when I hear this--aside from the fact that in 2009 a driver slammed into my car because she was texting and not paying attention to the fact that the light was mine--is that report on CNN a few weeks back about a search engine called Shodan. Basically it searches for and indexes devices connected to the Internet ranging from webcams and printers to more exotic -- and frightening -- examples of security cameras and control systems for nuclear power plants. I am sure you can guess where this is going – or rather, where the CNN piece went. It described how these devices—almost all of which are unprotected—could conceivably be hacked and hijacked. To be sure, it is a far off scenario and many security experts will tell you that it is easier to just drive a truck into a nuclear power plant than try to gain control of it via some connected printer. Even more frightening, and more realistic, is how vulnerable mobile devices make us. Verizon Enterprise Solutions' Omar Khawaja, managing principal of its Global Security told me he recently met with the CSO of a defense contractor which had a flat network – meaning there is no segmentation to prevent access from one end of the enterprise to another. ""In this case, this was particularly concerning since the defense contractor had an IP-enabled manufacturing facility that built weapons  – which were accessible from anywhere within the enterprise,"" Khawaja says. As we know, it is fairly typical for enterprises to permit remote access to the corporate network via a mobile device, he continued. ""Things start to get pretty risky when you combine the two – flat network and remote access via mobile – this results in the enterprise being accessible from anywhere in the world."" More deep scary thoughts come from Roger Skidmore, CTO of AirDefense at Motorola Solutions, who notes that there is increasingly little difference between the capabilities of mobile and desktop / stationary devices, which means basically, that a mobile device can have the same attraction for hackers as traditional desktop/stationary devices, plus all of the extra risks that mobility brings.  It is even possible, says John Thielens, chief security officer at Axway, for mobile malware to make its way to a mainframe in a complicated scenario he paints that involves key loggers, network analyzers, or file transfer utilities. So I like, no I love, Benioff's visions of connected devices and how they can add to the knowledge base that companies are collecting about consumers – collecting with their permission and always opt-in (okay, one can dream). But the potential security risks are frightening.

Parents can buy a maximum of two 900g tins of Aptamil or Cow & Gate milk each time they shop at Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury’s  and Morrisons. The restrictions – requested by Danone which makes both brands – come after students and businessmen were found to be bulk-buying the tins and sending them to China. Limits: Parents can buy a maximum of two 900g tins of Aptamil or Cow & Gate milk each time they shop at Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury's and Morrisons Some Chinese families living here are filling suitcases with the tins and taking them to China when they visit relatives. Many Chinese families do not believe their locally-made powdered milk is safe following a scandal in 2008. Six babies died and 300,000 became ill after drinking formula milk found to have been laced with industrial chemicals to boost protein levels. Demand for foreign-made brands has since soared. RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 2 Next Kindergartener kicked out of New York school because she... Baby thriving five months after undergoing surgery while... Babies behind bars in Afghanistan: Inside the hellish jails... Share this article Share Chinese mistrust of local manufacturers was heightened when last month a firm was found to be selling milk that was five years out of date. Danone said the restrictions should not cause huge problems for British customers as they tend to buy one tin at a time. There is also nothing to stop parents going to a second supermarket for two more tins. Formula: Security guards have been hired at some stores to check customers do not return later that day for another batch of milk for babies (file picture) But security guards have been hired at some stores to check customers do not return later that day for another batch  of milk. Parenting groups accused the manufacturer of scaremongering and said the restrictions would cause unnecessary anxiety for mothers. 'Even talk of shortages will worry British mums. Not being able to feed your baby hits at the most primeval fears of every mother. And if there are shortages of specific brands, this will cause problems as children get used to the taste of a formula and can be fussy if it is switched for another' Siobhan Freegard, founder of Netmums Siobhan Freegard, founder of Netmums.com, said: ‘Even talk of shortages will worry British mums. Not being able to feed your baby hits at the most primeval fears of every mother. 'And if there are shortages of specific brands, this will cause problems as children get used to the taste of a formula and can be fussy if it is switched for another. ‘Baby milk firms get a lot of bad PR so this is an opportunity for them to be straight with consumers and let mums know what is going on. ‘Rising demand in China has been blamed for a whole range of shortages and price hikes from cotton clothing to petrol and diesel. 'While there is no doubt that huge demand could push up the price of milk powder, it is scaremongering to suggest the shelves of British supermarkets will be stripped bare of formula. Shipped to Shanghai: Many Chinese families do not believe their locally-made powdered milk is safe following a scandal in 2008 (file picture) ‘If demand in China is up as much as is being claimed, it’s an opportunity for formula firms to take on extra workers and create jobs in the UK and around the world to meet demand.’ In February it emerged that mothers were paying four times the price for Aptamil and Cow & Gate milk on eBay because shops had run out. At the time Danone blamed a ‘production delay’ and there was no mention of products being exported to China. 'We would like to apologise to parents for any inconvenience caused by this limit. We know that most parents only buy one pack at a time, so we hope that the impact of this limit on UK parents will be minimal' Danone spokesman There are presently no plans to limit other popular brands such as SMA and HiPP. Danone does not know how long its restrictions will last. Earlier this year Australia and Hong Kong introduced restrictions after Chinese customers and tourists were found to be sending large quantities of formula milk back home. A spokesman for Danone said: ‘We understand that the increased demand is being fuelled by unofficial exports to China to satisfy the needs of parents who want Western brands for their babies. 'We would like to apologise to parents for any inconvenience caused by this limit. 'We know that most parents only buy one pack at a time, so we hope that the impact of this limit on UK parents will be minimal. ‘If parents are unable to find their baby’s usual brand of milk, we recommend they try another local store or revisit the store on another occasion.’ Share or comment on this article:

Leonardo DiCaprio, Vittoria Ceretti Go For Romantic Bike Ride in New York City What's The Big Frigin' Difference?! Freight Train Robbed in Broad Daylight by Dozens of Scrambling Thieves Justin Bieber -- Pot Bust on Tour Bus in Sweden Justin Bieber Pot Bust on Tour Bus Exclusive Details 4/25/2013 9:15 AM PT TMZ has spoken with a rep for the Stockholm PD, who told us ... Around 7:10 PM on Wednesday night, an officer smelled weed coming from Justin's bus, which was parked in front of the Grand Hotel. Cops say ... when the bus left the hotel and headed toward the Globe Arena, the officer contacted a special narcotics unit, which issued a warrant to search Bieber's bus. We're told cops searched the bus in the parking garage of the Globe Arena -- no one was on the bus at the time. Cops say they found a small amount of narcotics (they won't say which drug, but local papers say it's weed) -- along with a taser. We're told cops have not identified a suspect yet ... and the bus has not been impounded. Bieber had been seen with his pal Lil Za in the hours before the weed incident ... and FYI, Za is the guy who was seen smoking pot with Bieber at an L.A. home earlier this year. Cops tell us NO ONE WILL BE CHARGED because they have no idea who was in possession of the drug since the bus was empty.

Mr Hollande's personal approval rating has plunged to just 25 per cent of the population amid soaring unemployment and ballooning public debt. He is even more unpopular that President Charles de Gaulle was in 1968 - when millions of French rioted to demand a complete overhaul of French society. French President Francois Hollande (centre) attends a breakfast meeting at the Elysee Palace in Paris today: He has faced a series of personal and professional crisis since coming to power Anger: Hollande's social reform agenda has provoked mass dissent with thousands hitting the streets on Sunday to oppose the legalisation of gay marriage The latest survey by pollsters Ifop found 38 per cent of the French were 'quite unhappy' with their socialist leader and 36 per cent were 'very unhappy' with him. Mr Hollande came to power in May 2012 amid a fanfare of promises to redistribute wealth and rebuild France's ailing public services. RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Thousands take to streets of Paris to protest against... French bus drivers to go on strike in protest over their new... Share this article Share He declared himslef as 'anti-rich', and was dubbed 'Mr Normal' by the French press in sharp contrast to outgoing president Nicolas Sarkozy's love of private jets, designer suits and a supermodel wife. Divisive: Hollande's partner Valerie Trierweiler has proved to be a controversial figure He also promised a 'transparent' government that would not tolerate the repeated political corruption scandals that tainted the Sarkozy regime. But after eight months in the job, he has been humiliated by a catalogue of political, economic and personal crises and found himself unable to control either the public finances or the wayward antics of First Lady Valerie Trierweiler. Millionaires have been fleeing France in fear of a proposed 75 per cent tax on all earnings over one million euros. The French equivalent of the UK's Confederation of British Industry, called MEDEF, has warned the president that France risked becoming 'the poor man of Europe' over his 'disastrous' economic policies. The latest economic data shows households' spending power has fallen for the first time since 1984, and that jobless figures rose for a 22nd straight month in March to 10.6 per cent - the highest level since 1997. His problems culminated this month with revelations his own budget minister Jerome Cahuzac had been hiding up to 20 million euros in a secret bank account to dodge taxes. Hollande reacted by demanding that all 37 members of his government publish details of the wealth - and faced more flak for exposing six millionaires in his 'Champagne' socialist administration. His girlfriend Valerie Trierweiler, 47, has also been the target of repeated media attacks since her boyfriend was elected president. In June, she was at the centre of accusations she tried to wreck the political career of Segolene Royal - the mother of Mr Hollande's four children - by tweeting her support for a candidate standing against her in the parliamentary elections. She is also demanding 70,000 pounds in damages over a book claiming she cheated on her husband with TWO lovers at once. And she faced humiliation in December when her boss at the French magazine where she works described her as an 'unpinned grenade' and said she would be sacked at the end of this year. A spokesman for pollsters Ifop said: 'He claimed to be the Robin Hood president who would help the poor and sweep away the corruption of the Sarkozy years. 'But he has been hit on all sides, by the economy, his policies, corruption and personal attacks. No president has ever been re-elected after falling as low as this.' But Mr Hollande does still have one fervent hotbed of support - three thousand miles away in Mali, where he is being hailed as hero after successfully sending in French troops to crush a takeover by extremist Islamist rebels. The Ifop poll published on Sunday was carried out by phone on 1,875 French voters aged over 18 between April 11 and 19. Approval rating: President Hollande is as popular as his predecessor Charles de Gaulle as riots rocked the country in 1968 Unrest: The Paris protests of 1968 were led by students who demanded fundamental changes to society Share or comment on this article:

Subscribe Sign In Subscribe South Korea Looming Clash Between Seoul and Washington Over Nuclear Technology By Audrey Yoo April 30, 2013 Share Read Later Send to Kindle YONHAP / EPA South Korean President Park Geun-hye receives U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry in Seoul on April 12, 2013 Email Print Share Facebook Twitter Tumblr LinkedIn StumbleUpon Reddit Digg Mixx Delicious Google+ Follow @TIMEWorld When South Korean President Park Geun-hye visits Washington on May 5 she will be reaffirming the 60-year alliance between the U.S. and her country with cordiality. Relations between Washington and Seoul are better than ever thanks to a free-trade agreement, greater policy coordination and solidarity against North Korea’s provocations. But there is an unresolved question in their relationship: How much nuclear technology should South Korea possess? Representatives from both countries have tried to answer that question since October 2010, when they started negotiating over the 1974 nuclear-cooperation agreement, which permits commercial nuclear trade between the two nations. Under the pact, South Korea is banned from reprocessing spent U.S. fuel and enriching uranium — technologies that could be used to make weapons. Now, nearly 40 years after the agreement was signed, South Korea wants Washington to lift that ban. The U.S. refuses to do so. Washington and Seoul were supposed to come up with a new deal this spring before the original agreement expires in March 2014. They haven’t done so, but to prevent a hiatus in nuclear trade the two decided to extend the current agreement for two years and hold additional negotiations every three months until the new expiry date. “Because our cooperation is increasingly broad and deep, there are several complex technical issues that will take some additional time and effort to resolve,” said the U.S. State Department in a statement. The stopgap extension helps avoid potential awkwardness between Park and Obama at their first summit, but it ultimately underscores the clash between Seoul’s goals to expand its nuclear-energy industry and Washington’s efforts to contain the spread of nuclear technologies that could be used to produce weapons. ( PHOTOS: North Korea Ratchets Up Tension on the Peninsula ) Washington’s argument is that if South Korea has enrichment and reprocessing rights, then other countries that are trying to sign nuclear-cooperation agreements with the U.S. will also ask for the same rights and undermine nonproliferation efforts. That line of thinking does not go down well in South Korea, which considers itself a special ally of Washington. “It’s an issue of mistrust,” says Hahm Chai-bong, the president of the Asan Institute for Policy Studies in Seoul. “To simply tell us right now that we don’t have the right to do reprocessing and enrichment because we might be like the North Koreans — that’s just unfair given our relationship and our standing within the global community.” South Korea’s latest push for securing enrichment and reprocessing technologies has coincided with North Korea’s open threats of war, but many say this is merely a coincidence and that South Korea has no real interest in an expensive nuclear arsenal. The more pressing motivation is commercial: nuclear energy is big business in South Korea, where 23 reactors supply about 40% of the country’s electricity. South Korea plans to generate almost 60% of its electricity from nuclear energy by 2030 and is also building reactors in the United Arab Emirates. As an emerging nuclear-energy leader, it has ambitions to export up to 80 reactors worth more than $400 billion in the next 20 years. To become a more competitive nuclear exporter like France and Russia, South Korea needs the ability to provide nuclear fuel to its customers abroad, goes the argument. And because the nation is running out of space to store nuclear waste, it needs permission to reprocess spent fuel, the South Korean government says. ( MORE: What a Park Presidency Means for South Korea’s Foreign Policy ) U.S. and South Korean negotiators are scheduled to meet again in June, but analysts expect no immediate breakthrough in the talks. “A fair agreement will be one that recognizes South Korea’s emerging role by allowing it access to the technologies that it needs, such as proliferation-resistant used-fuel-management technology, while maintaining tighter controls on technologies such as enrichment, which the U.S. correctly understands as carrying a higher proliferation risk,” wrote Jack Spencer, a senior research fellow in nuclear energy at the Washington, D.C.–based Heritage Foundation. Seoul says one possible solution for breaking the deadlock is pyroprocessing technology. Unlike conventional reprocessing, which produces plutonium (the primary ingredient for building bombs), some scientists believe pyroprocessing leaves separated plutonium mixed with other elements, making it less suitable for nuclear weapons. Experts, however, have yet to reach a consensus that pyroprocessing is more proliferation-resistant. The U.S. and South Korea signed a 10-year research-and-development agreement in 2011 to experiment with pyroprocessing technology. As more research comes out, both sides might have room for compromise. In the unlikely event that the deadlock remains permanent, Seoul might try to enrich uranium imported from other countries, which is not banned under the current agreement. But taking that path could seriously strain the alliance. For now, South Korea appears set on gaining Washington’s seal of approval. “We have a proven record of having been the best user of nuclear power for peaceful uses — that’s the way we should continue to use it,” explains Hahm. “We’ll see how convinced the Americans are.” It is a sentiment that South Korea’s President will certainly be gauging in Washington.

The state-owned company said Tuesday the contract is for 10 to 15 years and could generate up to $2.5 billion in sales. It says the wings will be made at an Israeli facility that already produces wings for Lockheed's F-16 warplane. The F-35 is the Pentagon's most expensive weapons program, with an estimated cost of nearly $400 billion. The program aims to replace a wide range of existing aircraft for the U.S. and several partner countries. The program has suffered repeated delays. The Pentagon briefly grounded its small fleet of F-35s in February after discovering a small crack in an engine turbine blade.

"'Hizbullah: Israel preparing something' - The Jerusalem Post Advertisement JP Newsletter Israel News Health & Wellness WORLD NEWS Middle East Business & Innovation Opinion JP Store Login Log Out Archaeology Israel Real Estate Judaism Kabbalah Environment Antisemitism JP Spanish Podcasts JP Shopping Conversation Corner Premium Jerusalem Post Middle East 'Hizbullah: Israel preparing something' Sources tell Arab paper the organization is on high alert. By JPOST.COM STAFF JULY 9, 2010 23:04 Sheikh Naim Kassem (photo credit: AP) Israel is “preparing something” for Lebanon and Hizbullah is on high alert to prevent it, unnamed sources in the group were quoted by London-based newspaper Al-Sharq Al-Awsat as saying Saturday. The IDF recently declassified and released high-quality intelligence of Hizbullah positions in southern Lebanon. Many interpreted the IDF's publicizing of the intelligence as an attempt both to deter Hizbullah attacks and to prepare the Israeli public for a future war should it be deemed necessary. The Hizbullah sources claimed the photos were fabrications, but said “we are avoiding any heated exchanges because we want the Lebanese’s summer to pass quietly and without incident.” Hizbullah's deputy Secretary-General Sheikh Naim Qassem on Friday said Israel would suffer tremendous casualties in the event of another war. In an interview with Syrian television cited by Press TV, Qassem said: ""If the result of the July [2006] war was a failure to the Israelis, then Israel would suffer a big loss in its next aggression."" RELATED: Sending Hizbullah a message: Israel is ready Editorial: The IDF fights back Qassem's remarks came on the fourth anniversary of the Second Lebanon War and were considered a response to the IDF's release of the photos. On Wednesday, top IDF officers revealed that the air force today has thousands of designated targets it can bomb if war were to break out. Some of them, like those that appear on the maps of the southern Lebanese village of el-Khiam that were declassified on Wednesday, are of arms caches, command-and-control centers and rocket launchers. Others are likely long-range rockets, like the highly accurate M600 or Scuds, which Syria is reported to have recently transferred to Lebanon. In the four years that have passed since the Second Lebanon War, both the IDF and Hizbullah have been busy studying their mistakes and implementing the necessary lessons. The IDF significantly increased training regimens, developed and procured active-protection systems for tanks and armored personnel carriers and is investing in building new urban warfare training centers due to an understanding that the next conflict would be fought in the narrow streets of southern Lebanese villages.

I'm extremely happy to be vindicated,"" he says New information has come to light, U.S. attorney says Source says investigators are looking at someone trying to frame him Curtis had been accused of mailing the poison to Obama, a U.S. senator and a judge CNN — Thrust into the headlines last week, accused of sending ricin-tainted letters to President Barack Obama and two other officials, Paul Kevin Curtis is a free man again. “It’s like a train has been lifted off my shoulders,” Curtis told CNN’s “Piers Morgan Live”  on Tuesday.  “I’m overwhelmed. I’m extremely happy to be vindicated and out and able to see my kids.” Charges were dropped and “new information” became available, U.S. Attorney Felicia Adams said. Authorities are investigating whether someone may have tried to falsely implicate the Elvis impersonator from Corinth, Mississippi, a law enforcement source said on condition of anonymity. Curtis was arrested April 17 and charged with sending a threat to the president last week after letters containing the poison triggered security scares around Washington.

I just kept asking, ‘what is ricin? What did I do?’” Curtis’ attorney, Christi McCoy, said her client has been framed by someone who used several phrases Curtis likes to use on social media. The letters read, in part: “To see a wrong and not expose it, is to become a silent partner to its continuance.” They were signed “I am KC and I approve this message,” a source told CNN. They each had a Memphis, Tennessee, postmark and no return address. McCoy said she was sure someone else was to blame. “I do believe that someone who was familiar and is familiar with Kevin just simply took his personal information and did this to him,” McCoy said. “It is absolutely horrific that someone would do this.” Curtis said it was an eye-opener for him. “I think now, how many people are thrown in jail because of circumstantial evidence and someone can frame you that easily,” he said. Curtis had been accused of sending letters containing “a suspicious granular substance” to Obama; Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Mississippi; and Sadie Holland, a Justice Court judge in Lee County, Mississippi. The FBI said the substance tested positive for ricin, a toxin derived from castor beans that has no known antidote. No illnesses had been found as a result of exposure to the toxin.

The rights organization said it welcomed the Thursday start of an Ivorian trial against soldiers implicated in crimes committed in the post-election crisis that followed late 2010 elections. Advertisement Former Ivorian President Laurent Gbagbo is on trial at The Hague for crimes committed during the crisis. Human rights groups suspect both sides committed atrocities. Human Rights Watch estimates that at least 3,000 people died as a result of fighting that raged from November 2010 to May 2011. Elections were meant to unite a country divided by conflict, but instead pushed it to the brink of civil war. Human Rights Watch said nobody from the national Republican Forces, created by Ouattara, has been arrested in relation to the post-election violence. West African researcher for Human Rights Watch Matt Wells said from Nairobi there's been real progress economically, but not much in terms of justice. With April marking the 2nd anniversary of Gbagbo's arrest, it's ""a reminder of how much time has passed without sufficient headway on crucial issues like security sector reform and justice for sensitive cases involving the Republican Forces,"" he said.

Matters YOU US TNS World Urgency mounts: Talks to end US shutdown takes shape By AFP January 26, 2019 US lawmakers and the White House faced intensifying pressure on Friday to resolve a five-week impasse and reopen government, as the political stalemate has begun to affect the nation’s busy airports. After two competing bills to end the partial shutdown failed in the Senate, its members were urgently scrambling for a fix -- even a temporary one -- that would get hundreds of thousands of federal employees back on the job. Negotiations that jump-started late on Thursday are focused on a bipartisan proposal for a three-week stopgap funding measure that would reopen lapsed agencies and allow time for haggling over what has become the main budget impasse: President Donald Trump’s insistence on a US-Mexico border wall. All eyes were on the talks between Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer, rivals seeking a way out of the deepening crisis. Normally paid every two weeks, 800,000 federal workers -- many of whom are being forced to work without pay -- missed a second straight paycheck on Friday, a situation that has reached a crisis point for thousands of American families. The urgency was made plain on Friday as flight delays rippled across parts of the eastern US due to staffing shortages in airports where employees, including air traffic controllers, have been ordered to work without pay. The Federal Aviation Administration said ground delays remained in effect at La Guardia, the New York region’s third-largest airport, while the airport in Atlanta, one of the world’s busiest, is at Code Red, with flight delays of one hour. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi warned that the shutdown ""has already pushed hundreds of thousands of Americans to the breaking point.""""Now it’s pushing our airspace to the breaking point too,"" she tweeted, calling on Trump to ""stop endangering the safety, security and well-being of our nation.""

Video Ad Feedback Racehorse trainer banned for 8 years 02:14 - Source: CNN Story highlights Leading horse racing trainer Mahmood Al Zarooni receives eight-year ban Al Zarooni had admitted to administering anabolic steroids to 15 top thoroughbreds Horses in question also suspended from running for six months Punishments handed down by British Horseracing Authority in London CNN — The trainer at the center of a doping scandal that stunned the world of horse racing was banned for eight years Thursday by the governing body of the sport of Britain. Mahmood Al Zarooni, who worked at the world famous Godolphin operation in Newmarket, was handed the punishment by a disciplinary panel of the British Horseracing Authority (BHA), sitting in London. The 37-year-old admitted a “catastrophic error” in administering prohibited anabolic steroids – ethylestranol and stanozolol – to 15 leading thoroughbreds. Eleven of the horses tested positive when a doping control team from the BHA visited Godolphin’s Moulton Paddocks Stables on April 9. Al Zarooni volunteered information about the other four. winning post dubai wrap_00020911 video Related video Dubai World Cup wrap winning post godolphin trainers_00014612 video Related video Godolphin trainers in Dubai All 15 horses, including the former 1,000 Guineas favorite Certify, were banned from racing for six months earlier Thursday by the BHA. Zero tolerance “We believe that the eight-year disqualification issued to Mahmood Al Zarooni, together with the six-month racing restriction placed on the horses in question by the BHA, will serve to reassure the public, and the sport’s participants, that use of performance-enhancing substances in British racing will not be tolerated,” said BHA chief executive Paul Bittar. Godolphin, one of the world’s most successful stables, is owned by Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, the ruler of Dubai. Read: Godolphin trainer charged over failed doping tests He issued a statement Wednesday admitting he was “appalled and angered” by the revelations of doping in his racing empire and had ordered the lockdown of his British operation. “I can assure the racing public that no horse will run from that yard this season until I have been absolutely assured by my team that the entire yard is completely clean,” he said. Prompt action Bittar acknowledged this prompt action: “The next objective for BHA is to take the necessary steps to ensure that overall confidence in the integrity of the sport is not at risk. lklv macfarlane godolphin doping _00001903.jpg video Related video Doping scandal rocks UK horse racing “We welcome the proactive response of Godolphin and Sheikh Mohammed in announcing their intention to review the procedures of this stable and the need to ensure that all horses formerly trained by Mahmood Al Zarooni are tested and cleared before they race again.” Al Zarooni, who has trained a string of big race winners since joining Godolphin in March 2010, was charged with rule breaches related to prohibited substances, duty to keep medication records, and conduct prejudicial to racing. After the hearing, he gave his reaction in a statement: “First and foremost, I would like to apologize to his Highness, Sheikh Mohammed, as well as all those involved in Godolphin and the public. Trainer apology “I accept it was my responsibility to be aware of the rules regarding prohibited substances in Britain. I can only apologize. I have made a catastrophic error.” Simon Crisford, Godolphin’s racing manager, who accompanied Al Zarooni to the hearing, expressed his thoughts to gathered reporters. “Mr Al Zarooni acted with awful recklessness and caused tremendous damage,  not only to Godolphin and British racing,” he said. “I think it will take a very long time for Godolphin to regain the trust of  the British public. We’re shocked and completely outraged by the actions he has taken.” Bittar said the case had highlighted “inconsistencies” about what substances are permitted to be used in the training of horses in different parts of the world. The use of anabolic horses is permitted for out-of-competition use in Australian racing, such as helping to overcome injuries. “While around the world, horseracing bodies quite rightly adopt a zero tolerance policy to the presence of anabolic steroids when carrying out post-race testing, the approach is not so consistent for horses in training. “In an age of increasing international travel and competition we will put the subject on the agenda for discussion with our international colleagues,” Bittar added.

The 87-year-old former prime minister suffered a stroke at 11.28am on Monday while reading in a top suite at the five-star Ritz Hotel in central London, where she had been staying since Christmas. Her body was removed from the hotel, where suites cost up to £3,660 a night, by private ambulance almost 13 hours later at 12.20am yesterday, and her funeral was scheduled for next Wednesday. Scroll down for video Leaving: Baroness Thatcher's body was removed from the Ritz Hotel in central London by private ambulance Her twins Mark and Carol were abroad at the time of her death. The body was driven away with three undertakers in the front and escorted by four diplomatic protection officers on motorbikes. A BMW 4x4 followed with two men in the front and blacked-out windows behind. Security was heightened with more than a dozen police officers surrounding the hotel as the vehicle pulled away.

When she came out she was very uncertain on her feet, and a return home was out of the question. So she moved quietly into a suite at the Ritz – one of her favourite places – and she was invited by its owners the Barclay brothers to stay there for the foreseeable future. She never left. Her two carers took it in turns to stay with her and the same group of friends who took it in turns to see her at her Belgravia home were put on a rota at the Ritz. Preparations for the ceremonial funeral - due to take place at St Paul’s Cathedral in central London with full military honours - were underway as MPs began planning tributes to her in Parliament. Scene: Lady Thatcher died in a suite at the five-star Ritz Hotel in central London, where she had been staying Meanwhile, the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh will also attend the service at St Paul's Cathedral - the first political funeral Britain's monarch has attended personally since Winston Churchill's in 1965. Iron Lady: Margaret Thatcher (pictured in 2010) died on Monday aged 87 at the Ritz in central London Lady Thatcher's family was expected to gather in London yesterday, with her son Mark due to fly in from Spain last night and his twin Carol also now believed to be in the country. MPs are being recalled from Easter recess today to let them pay tribute to her. The House of Lords has also been recalled and will sit at 2.30pm - the same time as the Commons. But as tributes poured in for our first and only woman prime minister, many on the Left condemned the social impacts of her policies encouraging the free market and stripping power from unions. On Monday night, hundreds of people held parties to ‘celebrate’ her death in Glasgow and Brixton, south London. But today the Government will put down a motion expected to pay tribute to her. Prime Minister David Cameron is expected to give a statement to the Commons, followed by Labour leader Ed Miliband. There will also be time for backbench MPs to make their own tributes to her. As Lady Thatcher’s health deteriorated, the issue of whether she should be granted a state funeral - as Churchill was - grew increasingly controversial. However, it has emerged that she rejected the idea herself, and also insisted she did not want her body to lie in state or money to be spent on a fly-past. Instead, the streets will be cleared for a procession from Westminster to St Paul’s, where there will be a televised service attended by dignitaries from around the world.

Society Economy Sport IT & Technology Overview News Articles Interviews Calendar Invalid query Shakespeare scholars seek to debunk myths about the Bard April 23, 2013 - 17:49 AMT PanARMENIAN.Net - Edward de Vere, Francis Bacon, Christopher Marlowe and more than 70 other people suggested as candidates for having written the works of William Shakespeare are subjected to new academic rigour by Stratford-upon-Avon in a book that seeks to debunk popular myths about the Bard, The Australian reported citing The Times. Paul Edmondson and Stanley Wells, of the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust, decided to publish Shakespeare Beyond Doubt to counter the dizzying number of theories that ignore evidence of Shakespeare's authorship in favour of conspiracies that claim he was a proxy for a hidden hand. Dr Edmondson and Professor Wells decided to put together the book, because of the increasingly high profile supporters of the conspiracy theories - including the actors Sir Derek Jacobi, Mark Rylance and Michael York. Dr Edmondson said that he wished to define those who doubt that William Shakespeare of Stratford-upon-Avon not as ""anti-Stratfordian"", but as ""anti-Shakespeare"" because ""you can't have one without the other"". ""You wouldn't have Charles Dickens without London. You wouldn't have Michelangelo without Florence or Rome, so you wouldn't have Shakespeare without Stratford and London. ""One of the reasons why we produced this book was that we began to be really dismayed by the fact that [authorship courses are] being offered by at least two universities - Brunel has a masters course in Shakespeare authorship studies, and Concordia University in Portland, Oregon, has an entire Shakespeare authorship research centre dedicated to disproving that Shakespeare wrote the plays. We felt that it was time to do what we could to shed some truth on the situation."" The book includes chapters by experts on de Vere, who was the Earl of Oxford, Bacon and Marlowe that explain why, if one places value on historical evidence, they could not have written Shakespeare's plays.

My Account Sign In Sign Out Home :: Military :: Library :: News :: 2013 :: April :: Military Menu Introduction Systems Facilities Agencies Industry Operations Countries Hot Documents News Reports Policy Budget Congress Links WMD Intelligence Homeland Security Space Military Two Sudans Agree to Open 10 Border Crossings by VOA News April 23, 2013 Sudan and South Sudan have agreed to open 10 border crossings in the latest sign of improving ties between the countries, which nearly went to war last year. Speaking Tuesday in Addis Ababa, Sudan's Minister of Water Paul Mayom said that after months of intensive talks, the countries have created joint mechanisms to resolve their problems. 'And now we are really opening a new page for two countries to live together and to create very soft borders, borders which will connect the two peoples in the two countries together,' he said. The African Union is brokering talks to settle tensions between the two Sudans, many stemming from the south's breakaway from the north in July 2011. Disputes over oil and territory sparked clashes on the border in April 2012. Three months earlier, South Sudan shut down all oil production rather than pay what it considered high fees to use northern pipelines. Juba resumed exporting oil through the north last month, and the countries have agreed to demilitarize the border. The sides have yet to agree on how to split up the oil-producing Abyei region, and both countries accuse the other of supporting rebel movements on their territories.

His comments follow a meeting with Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Yaalon Monday on the second day of a week-long trip to the region. Hagel said the Obama administration is ""committed to providing Israel whatever support is necessary for Israel to maintain military superiority over any state or coalition of states."" Israel is Hagel's first stop of a six-day trip to the Middle East that is expected to be dominated by concerns over Iran's controversial nuclear program, Syria's civil war and political fallout in the region from the ""Arab Spring."" Hagel said the U.S. government would allow Israel to buy advanced U.S. missiles designed to take out air defenses, radar for fighter jets, aerial refueling planes and tilt-rotor transport aircraft that can take-off and land vertically.

Chances of progress at Saturday's session are unclear, however, after a first round ended with the two sides unable to reduce substantial differences. The six insist Iran cut back on its highest grade uranium enrichment production and stockpile, fearing Tehran will divert it from making nuclear fuel to form the material used in the core of nuclear warhead. Iran insists it has a right to enrich but says it has no interest to use the technology to make weapons. It wants more sanctions relief than the six are offering for any concessions on its part.

Moe Doiron/The Globe and Mail Share Toronto will be waiting for spring a bit longer (until Friday at the earliest). But even with a recent spurt of poor weather, all systems in the city are up and running, with no outages or major disruptions. More freezing rain is expected overnight and Toronto Police are watching the roads for collisions and fallen trees or power lines. Freezing rain Thursday morning caused several accidents, with cars sliding into ditches and guard rails, resulting in minor injuries. Toronto police are asking drivers to adjust to the conditions and proceed slowly, give other cars lots of space, and extend braking periods. Drivers are also asked to avoid switching lanes excessively. Environment Canada says more freezing rain is expected for the evening with a 60 per cent chance of snow or ice pellets. There is also a risk of thunderstorms through to Friday morning. Civic authorities are advising the homeless to take shelter, and will be relaxing service restrictions. An extreme weather alert is in effect and beds will be made available in shelters. No one will be asked to leave a shelter if it is full. Please enable JavaScript to view this content.

Gennady Onishchenko, the chief of Russia's consumer protection agency, Rospotrebnadzor, said that Borjomi has been officially reregistered and is eligible to start exports to Russia. Borjomi is the third Georgian beverage reregistered in Russia since Rospotrebnadzor's inspectors gave initial approval last month to about 30 Georgian wineries and mineral water companies. Russia imposed a ban on wine and mineral water imports from Georgia in 2006, citing quality concerns. At the time, Moscow-Tbilisi ties were strained because of Georgia's increasingly closer ties with the West. Tbilisi broke all diplomatic relations with Moscow after their August 2008 military conflict over Georgia’s breakaway region of South Ossetia.

When all the living former Presidents are together, it’s also a special day for our democracy.  We’ve been called “the world’s most exclusive club” — and we do have a pretty nice clubhouse.  But the truth is, our club is more like a support group.  The last time we all got together was just before I took office.  And I needed that.  Because as each of these leaders will tell you, no matter how much you may think you’re ready to assume the office of the presidency, it’s impossible to truly understand the nature of the job until it’s yours, until you’re sitting at that desk. And that’s why every President gains a greater appreciation for all those who served before him; for the leaders from both parties who have taken on the momentous challenges and felt the enormous weight of a nation on their shoulders.  And for me, that appreciation very much extends to President Bush. The first thing I found in that desk the day I took office was a letter from George, and one that demonstrated his compassion and generosity.  For he knew that I would come to learn what he had learned — that being President, above all, is a humbling job.  There are moments where you make mistakes.  There are times where you wish you could turn back the clock.  And what I know is true about President Bush, and I hope my successor will say about me, is that we love this country and we do our best. Now, in the past, President Bush has said it’s impossible to pass judgment on his presidency while he’s still alive.  So maybe this is a little bit premature.  But even now, there are certain things that we know for certain. We know about the son who was raised by two strong, loving parents in Midland, famously inheriting, as he says, “my daddy’s eyes and my mother’s mouth.”  (Laughter.)  The young boy who once came home after a trip to a museum and proudly presented his horrified mother with a small dinosaur tailbone he had smuggled home in his pocket.  (Laughter.)  I’ll bet that went over great with Barbara. We know about the young man who met the love of his life at a dinner party, ditching his plans to go to bed early and instead talking with the brilliant and charming Laura Welch late into the night. We know about the father who raised two remarkable, caring, beautiful daughters, even after they tried to discourage him from running for President, saying, “Dad, you’re not as cool as you think you are.”  (Laughter.)  Mr. President, I can relate.  (Laughter.)  And now we see President Bush the grandfather, just beginning to spoil his brand-new granddaughter. So we know President Bush the man.  And what President Clinton said is absolutely true — to know the man is to like the man, because he’s comfortable in his own skin.  He knows who he is.  He doesn’t put on any pretenses.  He takes his job seriously, but he doesn’t take himself too seriously.  He is a good man. But we also know something about George Bush the leader.  As we walk through this library, obviously we’re reminded of the incredible strength and resolve that came through that bullhorn as he stood amid the rubble and the ruins of Ground Zero, promising to deliver justice to those who had sought to destroy our way of life. We remember the compassion that he showed by leading the global fight against HIV/AIDS and malaria, helping to save millions of lives and reminding people in some of the poorest corners of the globe that America cares and that we’re here to help. We remember his commitment to reaching across the aisle to unlikely allies like Ted Kennedy, because he believed that we had to reform our schools in ways that help every child learn, not just some; that we have to repair a broken immigration system; and that this progress is only possible when we do it together. Seven years ago, President Bush restarted an important conversation by speaking with the American people about our history as a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants.  And even though comprehensive immigration reform has taken a little longer than any of us expected, I am hopeful that this year, with the help of Speaker Boehner and some of the senators and members of Congress who are here today, that we bring it home — for our families, and our economy, and our security, and for this incredible country that we love.  And if we do that, it will be in large part thanks to the hard work of President George W. Bush.  (Applause.) And finally, a President bears no greater decision and no more solemn burden than serving as Commander-in-Chief of the greatest military that the world has ever known.  As President Bush himself has said, “America must and will keep its word to the men and women who have given us so much.”  So even as we Americans may at times disagree on matters of foreign policy, we share a profound respect and reverence for the men and women of our military and their families.  And we are united in our determination to comfort the families of the fallen and to care for those who wear the uniform of the United States.  (Applause.) On the flight back from Russia, after negotiating with Nikita Khrushchev at the height of the Cold War, President Kennedy’s secretary found a small slip of paper on which the President had written a favorite saying:  “I know there is a God.  And I see a storm coming.  If he has a place for me, I believe I am ready.” No one can be completely ready for this office.  But America needs leaders who are willing to face the storm head on, even as they pray for God’s strength and wisdom so that they can do what they believe is right.  And that’s what the leaders with whom I share this stage have all done.  That’s what President George W. Bush chose to do.  That’s why I’m honored to be part of today’s celebration. Mr. President, for your service, for your courage, for your sense of humor, and, most of all, for your love of country, thank you very much.  From all the citizens of the United States of America, God bless you.  And God bless these United States.  (Applause.)

Ban Ki-moon, the United Nations Secretary-General ,  welcomed efforts by Asian countries at a United Nations-backed regional forum this week in addressing the role of transportation in the effort to fight climate change and achieve sustainable development. In his message at the opening of the Seventh Regional Environmentally Sustainable Transport Forum in Asia and Global Consultation on Sustainable Transport in the post 2015 Development Agenda, the Secretary-General commended delegates for discussing next-generation transport systems for the 21st century. The design and construction of sustainable transport infrastructure on a global scale was highlighted as a major element in the struggle to minimize vulnerability to climate change and natural disasters. The Forum was urged to contribute to a transformative post-2015 development agenda. The two-day meeting, held in Bali, Indonesia, will explore a variety of issues related to transport in relation to the outcome of the 2012 UN Conference on Sustainable Development, known as Rio+20 under the theme Next Generation Transport System We Want for 21st Century~ Looking Beyond Rio+20. Topics include the promotion of public bicycle schemes, greenways initiatives for converting road space into leaner parks and high quality pedestrian areas, and the full integration of public transport modes. In addressing the importance of sustainable transport, Ban also noted that access to goods and services through efficient means was “essential” not only in preserving the environment but also in reducing poverty. The role of better land-use and transport system planning in facilitating access to jobs, goods and services has been highlighted as a major factor in sustainable development in the region. Echoing this point in a message delivered Tuesday to Brazil’s National Association of Mayors, the Secretary-General also urged Brazil’s local officials to renew their commitment to developing sustainable cities in order to ensure better lives for the growing numbers of people who inhabit the world’s urban environments.

U.N. spokesman in Myanmar Aye Win said humanitarian deliveries in areas controlled by the Kachin Independence Army are restricted. The Kachin movement hasn't given full permission to aid workers to travel in the area. Advertisement ""We now can only travel to the places where we are allowed to go,"" he told Thai newspaper The Irrawaddy. The Myanmar government agreed to facilitate aid delivery to Kachin state early this year. Aid workers and Kachin rebels said aid would increase once progress on peace is made in the area. Myanmar President Thein Sein was awarded by the International Crisis Group for political reforms that began with general elections in 2010. The European Union this week eased sanctions on Myanmar in response to those reforms. The president imposed martial law over parts of Myanmar last month following clashes between minority Muslims and Buddhists. Similar conflicts erupted last year in other parts of the country, including Kachin and Rakhine. Rights groups were critical of the ICG and the EU for lauding Myanmar. Easing sanctions removed the pressure that brought about political reforms, rights groups said.

The Prime Minister said he thought the majority of national feeling was to grieve for the loss of a great leader, but conceded that sections of British society did not agree. Since the Iron Lady's death on Monday hundreds have taken part in parties across the UK, where attendees have swigged champagne, burned pictures of her and danced with joy. Anarchists have also vowed to ‘re-enact’ the poll tax riots last night as they plotted to wreck Baroness Thatcher’s funeral. Die-hard fanatics hope a ‘protest’ in Trafalgar Square on Saturday night will ignite an explosion of violence that will culminate with disturbances on Wednesday. Asked if he was disappointed about animosity towards the former prime minister, Mr Cameron said: 'I think the overwhelming sense across the country, and you can see it yesterday in the House of Commons, is that we are mourning the loss of someone who gave a huge amount to this country, that was an extraordinary leader. 'I think that is how the overwhelming majority of people feel. 'Of course, some people won't agree with that but I think that some of the scenes we have seen are frankly pretty distasteful, but people should be responsible for themselves.' Labour confirmed that it had resumed political campaigning after a pause to show respect for Lady Thatcher. Already protesters, seen here in Brixton, have been ghoulishly celebrating the former prime minister's death Police and party goers clash after a Margaret Thatcher death street party got out of hand in Bristol Mr Cameron said Lady Thatcher's upbringing in Grantham, where her father was a grocer, contributed to her hard-work ethic when she rose to power. 'I think there was a really strong link between her upbringing, her values, and her action. 'I think you can sum up what she believed in - sound money, strong defence, don't spend what you haven't got - those strong values came from her upbringing and she applied them to the government of our country at a time when we really needed it. 'I think that was part of her success.' RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 2 3 Next 'They danced in the streets when Hitler died too': Drama... Entering the family business? Baroness Thatcher's American...

Part of the learning the apprentices undertake at the site is on a Trent 1000 engine, which powers the Boeing 787 Dreamliner. Visit: Mr Cameron met apprentices during a visit to Rolls Royce Learning and Career Development Centre today Mr Cameron defended the decision to recall Parliament, even though MPs were due to return to Westminster on Monday. 'I thought it brought the Parliament together, it brought out the best in Parliament and I think it was part of a fitting send-off to our first ever woman prime minister,' he told Sky News's Boulton & Co programme. Asked about reports that Speaker John Bercow had been taken aback by the request to bring back MPs, he said: 'The request was made and the Speaker granted it and that's why Parliament was recalled.' Mr Cameron also said he believed it was right that Lady Thatcher was being given a ceremonial funeral with full military honours. 'I think it is right to have a ceremonial funeral, with key elements of a state funeral, with the troops lining the route,' he said. 'I think people would find us a pretty extraordinary country if we didn't properly commemorate with dignity, with seriousness, but with also some fanfare ... the passing of this extraordinary woman. 'I think not only in Britain would people say 'you are not doing this properly', but I think the rest of the world think we were completely wrong.' Meanwhile a Labour councillor who runs a fire authority has been slammed for sick tweets about Margaret Thatcher's death - including macabre jibes about her burning. John Edwards sparked outrage when he posted: 'The passing of £thatcher Rejoice! Rejoice!' on his Twitter account on Wednesday. But he reserved his most tasteless comments for a person who tweeted: 'Probably the best way to deal with millions wanting to dance on your grave: Thatcher to be cremated'. Cllr Edwards, who is paid nearly £40,000-a-year by taxpayers, replied: 'Surely the Lady's not for burning?' On the day of the Iron Lady's death, the senior councillor tweeted: 'Don't expect people in towns and villiges (sic) who had the hearts ripped out of their coalfield communities to be weeping today.' In another tweet on the same day, he said: 'Can the people who've been urging respect for £thatcher (even though she showed no respect for us) let us know when we can let rip again?'

ISLAMABAD: Pakistani intelligence agencies have warned that the Taliban have made plans to kidnap former military ruler Pervez Musharraf , who is currently being held at his private residence here after being arrested in several criminal cases. The intelligence agencies have issued an advisory that the banned Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan might attempt to abduct Musharraf while he is being taken from his farmhouse to court, Geo News channel reported today. The channel quoted its sources as saying that the Taliban was working with other jihadi groups to kidnap Musharraf . The intelligence agencies directed security agencies to ensure strict surveillance and tight security to foil the plans of the militants, the report said. Shortly after Musharraf returned to Pakistan from self- exile last month, the Taliban announced that they had formed a special squad of suicide bombers and snipers to target him. A car rigged with a huge amount of explosives was recently found near Musharraf's farmhouse on the outskirts of Islamabad, which was declared a ""sub-jail"" after he was arrested last week when a court revoked his bail in a case over the detention of dozens of judges during the 2007 emergency. Yesterday, Musharraf was formally arrested by the Federal Investigation Agency in the 2007 assassination of former premier Benazir Bhutto. Musharraf has been accused of failing to provide adequate security to Bhutto, who was killed by a suicide bomber after addressing an election rally in Rawalpindi. Musharraf returned to Pakistan last month after nearly four years of self-exile, promising to ""save"" the country from economic ruin and militancy. However, he was barred from running in the May 11 general election, which will mark the first democratic transition of power in Pakistan's history. He is facing several serious criminal cases. Lawyers have petitioned the Supreme Court to put him on trial for treason for imposing emergency in 2007 and he faces charges over the death of Baloch leader Akbar Bugti in a 2006 military operation.

Initial reports had said authorities feared up to four people had been killed in the area frequented by tourists. About 15 people were reportedly in the building, which included an office of the International Air Transport Association and an art gallery. Some 35 people in the surrounding area sustained injuries, according to Zdenek Schwarz, the head of Prague's rescue service. Authorities had originally said 40 had been injured in the blast.

"Your Taxes: Effects of the 2013 budget proposals - The Jerusalem Post Advertisement JP Newsletter Israel News Health & Wellness WORLD NEWS Middle East Business & Innovation Opinion JP Store Login Log Out Archaeology Israel Real Estate Judaism Kabbalah Environment Antisemitism JP Spanish Podcasts JP Shopping Conversation Corner Premium Jerusalem Post Business Business Features Your Taxes: Effects of the 2013 budget proposals New economic and fiscal policy will affect olim, trusts, gas investors and others. By LEON HARRIS APRIL 30, 2013 21:47 An accountant calculator taxes 370 (photo credit: Ivan Alvarado / Reuters) The new Israeli government is changing its economic and fiscal policy. Below are a few of the proposed changes that have been circulated for debate in the Economic Arrangements Bill. Immigrants: New disclosure rules New residents and senior returning residents (who lived abroad 10 years) currently enjoy a 10-year exemption from Israeli tax on foreign-source income and gains (tax holiday). Under the proposals, they will have to start reporting exempt income and gains derived abroad and to report overseas assets on any capital declaration they file regarding the tax-holiday period. This follows pressure from the OECD’s Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes. Currently, if a settlor moves to Israel and became an Israeli resident, the trust enjoys a 10-year exemption from Israeli tax (tax holiday) as the settlor on foreignsource income and gains. It is now proposed to stop the tax holiday for the trust if all the settlors die during the 10-year period. New and senior returning resident investors in a controlled foreign corporation (CFC) can no longer be used to avoid a CFC tax liability or a foreign professional corporation (FPC) tax liability for other regular Israeli residents. Trust tax changes Restrictions are proposed regarding the Foreign Resident Settlor Trust (FRST). This currently refers to a trust where: (1) upon formation of the trust and in the tax year concerned, all the settlors (i.e., grantors) are foreign residents; or (2) in the tax concerned, all the settlors and beneficiaries are foreign residents. For example, parents who have always resided outside Israel set up an FRST for the benefit of family in Israel. This can avoid all Israeli tax and reporting if the FRST derives all its income and gains outside Israel and distributes only cash to the family in Israel, not other assets. Stay updated with the latest news! Subscribe to The Jerusalem Post Newsletter Subscribe Now Until now, it was thought that FRST trusts are good for the Israeli balance of payments, but the Israel Tax Authority (ITA) has other ideas. Many changes are now proposed. In particular, if there is an Israeli resident beneficiary, the trustee will need to choose between paying ongoing Israeli tax at a rate of 25 percent on any trust allocation to the beneficiary or at a rate of 30% upon any distribution to the beneficiary. The tax on distributions will not apply to the extent it is proven that trust capital deposited by the settlor is distributed. Once a settlor of an FRST dies it is proposed to attribute trust income and assets to the beneficiaries. If any beneficiary is an Israeli resident, the trust will become a resident and taxable Israeli Residents’ Trust (IRT) and hold assets at their value as on the date of change (step up). Nevertheless, assets may also be allocated to foreign-resident beneficiaries – the implication being they may escape Israeli tax on their share of foreign income. When all the settlors of an IRT die, the trust will be taxable in Israel unless all the beneficiaries are foreign residents, according to the proposals. Distributions to a beneficiary will be subject to capital-gains tax. It is also proposed to require disclosure from beneficiaries of all trust distributions, including FRST distributions. An FRST may also lose its tax privileged status if the settlor and beneficiary don’t have a close enough relationship. If a beneficiary is a “first degree” relative (parent, child or grandchild of the settlor), the FRST will be accepted as such if all other conditions are met. If a beneficiary is a “second degree” relative, there will be a rebuttable assumption that the trust is an FRST if all other conditions are met; this refers to spouse, brother, sister, parent, grandparent, issue, issue of spouse, spouse of the aforementioned, sibling’s issue, sibling of parent. If there is no relationship between the settlor and beneficiary, the trust will be deemed to be a taxable IRT. The relationship must be disclosed to the ITA within 30 days after the trust is formed or within 60 days after the proposed law becomes effective. Underlying companies owned by a trust It is proposed to require underlying companies to be owned 100% by the trustee and to register with the ITA within 30 days after incorporation. They will not be considered Israeli resident for tax-treaty purposes. They may nevertheless be exempt from Israeli tax on foreign-source income and gains in certain circumstances. Controlled foreign company Israeli residents are taxed on deemed dividends received from a controlled foreign company (CFC) if they hold 10% or more of the CFC. A foreign company (or any other body of persons) is considered to be a CFC if a series of conditions are met. In practice, a CFC will typically be an offshore passive holding company. It is now proposed to tighten many of these conditions. In particular, the maximum tax rate on the CFC’s passive income would decline from 20% to 15% under the proposals. The minimum passive proportion of income or profits would decrease from 50% to 33.3%. The deemed foreign tax credit on deemed CFC dividends would no longer be allowed, only actual foreign tax credits on actual dividends or capital gains. Foreign professional company A foreign professional company (FPC) is deemed to be controlled and managed in Israel and, accordingly, taxable in Israel. A company is considered to be an FPC if a company meets all of the following conditions: (1) it has five or fewer individual shareholders; (2) it is owned 75% or more by Israeli residents; (3) most of its 10%-ormore shareholders conduct a special profession for the company; and (4) most of its income or profits are derived from a special profession. The special professions include engineering, management, technical advice, financial advice, agency, law, medicine and many others. The FPC rules are generally counteracted by Israel’s tax treaties. Therefore, it is proposed to tax the shareholders on deemed dividends from the FPC instead of taxing the FPC itself. Foreign investors in gas companie s It is proposed to impose Israeli capital-gains tax on foreign investors who sell Israeli securities of companies mainly invested in Israeli real-estate rights and rights to variable or fixed payments as consideration for the working of, or the right to work, mineral deposits, sources and other natural resources. In other words, it seems the Israeli government wants to tax capital gains of foreign investors in Israeli gas companies now that large quantities of gas have been found in the Mediterranean Sea off Israel. Reorganizations Transactions involving moving assets into special-purpose vehicles so they can be securitized will now be allowed under Israel’s tax-free reorganization rules. Also, the reorganization rules will be applicable to partnerships, not only companies. Overseas property sales It is proposed to deny rollover relief when a depreciable property abroad is sold and the proceeds are reinvested in another property – known in the US as a 1031 exchange. For example, an Israeli investor who sells US real estate will need to pay US tax straight away to credit it against Israeli tax, which will no longer be capable of deferral by reinvesting the sale proceeds. This proposal, if adopted, will probably help foreign tax coffers more than the Israeli Treasury. Reliance on professional opinions It is proposed that taxpayers will be required to disclose opinions and professional advice they have used or relied on from a professional adviser, including the resulting impact. This includes verbal advice about future transactions, and it will apply to all taxes including VAT and land-appreciation tax. Failure to disclose may lead to a fine of three times the tax saving, or NIS 50,000, whichever is higher. Tax Authority guidance It is proposed that taxpayers should disclose in their tax return any position adopted that is contrary to published positions of the ITA. Failure to disclose may lead to a fine of 50%-100% of the tax saving. This could be difficult because the ITA is sometimes as creative as taxpayers. The ITA claims this is accepted practice in the world. Tax enforcement Various measures are proposed to broaden tax enforcement. For example, the bailiffs will be allowed to seize taxpayers’ cars parked in a public area. Anyone guaranteeing the tax debts of a taxpayer may face the same fate if the taxpayer doesn’t pay his taxes. Closing comments The above proposals are not yet law. It remains to be seen what the Knesset will enact. For some reason, the biggest likely revenue raiser was overlooked: transfer pricing on the internal transactions of multinational groups. The changes regarding trusts appear to have political undertones, but they do not relate to all trusts. If any of the above seems relevant to you, it is vital to obtain professional advice soon. As always, consult experienced tax advisers in each country at an early stage in specific cases. leon@hcat.co Leon Harris is a certified public accountant and tax specialist at Harris Consulting & Tax Ltd.

SALT LAKE CITY — Bill and Beverly Miller have long been outstanding local advocates for Alzheimer's disease and have pushed for more available resources and treatment options. Now, they're taking their fight to Washington, D.C. The Salt Lake couple are participating in the upcoming Alzheimer's Association Advocacy Forum later this month, where they will meet with members of Congress to encourage action on Alzheimer's disease. Their efforts, coupled with many others, have led to progress on the mind-killing condition in Utah, helping to create a statewide plan that aims to increase awareness of the disease and help individuals and businesses deal with the changes within a person's brain that it can produce over time. ""We're just two out of millions of people in the United States affected by Alzheimer's disease,"" Bill Miller said. ""This disease doesn't just affect the individual with the disease. Its ripple effects are felt throughout entire families and communities."" He said legislative action would help ""make life a little easier for everyone in this situation."" Beverly Miller, 66, has experienced symptoms of cognitive decline in her day-to-day life for years. Many of her executive functions are now gone, which is very different for someone who used to run classrooms and offices with ease. Her husband, also once an academic man, has become her caregiver, constant companion and champion. We are going to Capitol Hill to tell Congress to fully fund the research, education, outreach, and support the activities and priorities included in the National Alzheimer's Plan. –Bill Miller After dealing with the sadness of a diagnosis more than three years ago, the Millers decided to involve themselves in a variety of activities, including the local chapter of the Alzheimer's Association, where they made friends, received support and learned more about the disease that was slowly stealing Beverly's mind. In Utah, more than 32,000 residents age 65 and older have Alzheimer's disease. Approximately 137,000 friends and family members help to manage the significant emotional, physical and financial challenges of caregiving for their loved ones dealing with the disease and other dementias, according to the local chapter. While Utah has the fastest-growing Alzheimer's disease population, up to 16 million Americans are expected to be diagnosed with the progressive and fatal mental deterioration by 2050. The surge is expected to strain family financial situations, but also the entire health care system and state and federal budgets, specifically Medicare. On Tuesday, President Barack Obama announced a new initiative to map the human brain, a plan modeled after the Human Genome Project, and one that is designed to encourage the development of new tools and technologies that aim to answer questions about Alzheimer's disease and other memory disorders. Congress has set a national goal to stop Alzheimer's by 2025, but with it, advocates hope to help erase the social stigmas associated with brain diseases. It is the first of its kind to delve into the biomedical science of the brain and its function. Congress has set a national goal to stop Alzheimer's by 2025, but with it, advocates hope to help erase the social stigmas associated with brain diseases and also forge the way for more research that could target causes and treatments for dementia, which is often only considered to be age-related. The president's 2013 budget proposal includes $80 million tagged for research and $20 million for awareness, education and outreach efforts, as well as caregiver support. Funding has yet to be approved by Congress. Advocates like the Millers were critical to the May 2012 release of the first National Alzheimer's Plan , which paves the way for potential financial appropriations and other efforts that could help slow the scourge of Alzheimer's disease. ""We are going to Capitol Hill to tell Congress to fully fund the research, education, outreach, and support the activities and priorities included in the National Alzheimer's Plan,"" Bill Miller said. ""We are facing a crisis that grows day by day, but Congress has yet to act decisively to overcome it. Now is the time."" The forum , in its 25th year, features various keynote speakers and breakout workshops dealing with topics of advocacy and education. It will be held April 22-24 in Washington, D.C., with congressional scheduled for April 24. Interested Utah residents can also contact state representatives by phone, email or U.S. mail.

Britain's Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh (R) receives the Order of Military Merit from Governor General of Canada David Johnston, at the Fairmont Royal York Hotel in Toronto April 26, 2013. Reuters Share Prince Philip has been named the first ever extraordinary companion of the Order of Canada, a special honour that recognizes the 91-year-old Prince's deep connection to Canada. The award was presented Friday by Governor-General David Johnston during a special ceremony in Toronto. Prince Philip is visiting Toronto for what is being described as a ""private working visit."" The Duke of Edinburgh had not been admitted to the Order of Canada before because he is not a Canadian citizen. However, Canada has created a new category of the order so that it can include members of the Royal Family. Prince Philip is the first to receive the honour under the recently created category of extraordinary companion. ""It provides for appointments of the Royal Family as a special recognition of the ties between the Royal Family and Canada,"" said Annabelle Cloutier, a spokesperson for the Governor-General. Prince Philip is scheduled to attend Ontario's provincial legislature Saturday for a breakfast reception with Premier Kathleen Wynne and Lieutenant-Governor David Onley.

Photograph: Alexander Zemlianichenko Jr/AP Opinion Russia This article is more than 11 years old Vladimir Putin wants to see me in jail for challenging corruption in Russia This article is more than 11 years old Alexei Navalny Russia's elite has stolen billions, they know that millions of people share my outrage, so they are protecting themselves Thu 11 Apr 2013 10.01 EDT Share O n 17 April, in the city of Kirov, begins a trial where I figure as the organiser of a criminal group intent on stealing logs and sawdust from the company Kirovles, as well as 16m roubles. After the cases against Mikhail Khodorkovsky, Pussy Riot, the 16 arrested for the 6 May protest , tens of thousands arrested on falsified cases, non-guilty verdicts that amount to 0.4% of all cases – after all that, the phrase ""Kafkaesque trial"" seems frightfully banal. Yes, there's a chance they will jail me. People have been telling me for four years that they will jail me, and after the start of our ""vote for any party, except the party of crooks and thieves"" campaign, people started telling me that every 10 seconds. Do I think about it? I do. Do I want to go to jail? No one does. Do Vladimir Putin and Alexander Bastrykin , the head of the investigative committee, dream about sending me to the camps? Actually, what they want most of all is for me to run away. But I'm not going to run away. I'm not going to emigrate. I have a family, two kids – criminal cases have been brought against my mother, my father, my brother; the authorities have carried out searches of nearly all my relatives and many friends. Everything has its price in life. The investigators listened to my telephone calls and read my emails, where I advised my ""partner in crime"" Peter Ofitserov to open a Gmail account – that's how they came to the conclusion that I created a ""criminal group"" and then tried to hide some sort of financial fraud. There is zero proof. They say: ""You stole 16m roubles."" Where do they get this figure from? How did they count it? Neither accounting expertise, nor research of the market has been done to prove that figure – none at all. Of course we will object to all this, will demand new expert studies, will bring our witnesses, but I have no illusions. There are two options: a suspended sentence or jail. If it's the first, then that means that they've chosen the ""Belarusian scenario"" in fighting with the opposition: in Belarus, even people who have been found guilty of administrative offences can never run for office. In Russia , an amendment to the electoral law was adopted saying those found guilty of grave crimes cannot be elected. And that's why they thought up this number of 16m roubles – theft of a rather large amount. That's how they solve their pragmatic problem: not to allow Navalny to take part in elections for the Moscow Duma or for Moscow mayor. Plus a ban on travel outside Moscow, so I can't travel around the country. And then, any other administrative penalty – being detained at a protest and given a 15-day sentence – automatically turns a suspended sentence into a real one. In other words: live at home, don't get involved in anything, a police baton is constantly hanging over your head. The second option is a real jail term, which, with what I'm charged under, can reach up to 10 years. I hope it will be a minimum security camp, not a maximum security one. I am ready for this. I've prepared myself for it appropriately – I've written out my power of attorney, have spoken about it many times with my wife. If they jail me, they jail me. Some will defend me. But, of course, this possibility doesn't call up any positive emotions. Why does Putin want to jail me? (I have no doubts that he personally has ordered my case). It seems to me the logic is obvious: he and his circle must guard their power. And to stay in power they have no other mechanism than jailing people – which is what they are doing. I'm not the first and, unfortunately, will not be the last: we must be ready for the fact that they will jail many more people. They've stolen billions, they know people are outraged by this, that millions of people share my attitude towards them and they are protecting themselves. Look what's happening in Belarus, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan: everywhere the method is the same. Putin takes his example from Lukashenko , Nazarbayev , Karimov . And that's how it will be in Russia as long as they are allowed to jail people, as long as a million people don't go out into the streets. The first protest on Bolotnaya Square scared them – they announced political reforms, then turned on the fear and PR techniques, people started getting scared to go to protests and then the reforms were first stopped, then subverted. As long as they are not really scared, they will continue to jail people. What will I take to prison? Slippers, tracksuit bottoms, pants and socks, trainers with Velcro, family photos that I'll tape to the wall. But let's not over-dramatise: millions of people have gone through this. More than 800,000 people are in jail here right now, if I have to go through it, I will. At the same time, I understand it's impossible to be totally prepared and maintain absolute calm. What will I do behind bars? Well, there is no lack of advice: some suggest to translate the Bible from German and learn German that way, or learn Chinese, or read 100,000 books. It's a cruel world there, no one would let you read 100,000 books. So why plan? Of course, I'd rather have an experience as I did in simple detention: you can climb on the shelf closer to the lamp, surrounded by books, sit and read and go for walks once a day. Yes there are cockroaches and dirt, and it's awfully smokey, and they feed you rubbish, but there's nothing awful in special detention. Camp on the other hand can be a lot worse: cold, nasty, where you are forced to do things, you give up your rights, they jail you in some concrete crap where there's nowhere even to sit. These days I often think about Mikhail Khodorkovsky : I'm going to move to a jail cell from a 75 square metre flat in Marino, in the outskirts of Moscow. What was it like for him to go to a camp from a mansion, five-star hotels, a private jet and all the rest that a person with many billions gets used to? Will I change my rhetoric? Of course not. People support me precisely because I call things by their names. I value what I've done and will not change my position because jail is on the horizon. I chose this path, I took on certain responsibilities before people who trusted me, and I knew what I was in for. This is an abridged version of an article originally published in The New Times .

Director of EU programs at Human Rights Watch Lotte Leicht said lifting sanctions removes the pressure that encouraged reforms in the first place. ""EU member states are ditching measures that have motivated the current progress and gambling on the good will of Burma's government and military to keep their word to keep reforms on track,"" she said in a statement from Brussels.

But even with wide voting margins in the legislature and popular support among the public, opposition to the measure that would grant equal marriage and adoption rights to same-sex couples has intensified in recent weeks. Protests in Paris have turned violent, and gay couples have been the victims of vicious assaults. As The New York Times reports : At the margins, the demonstrations have also become more violent and homophobic, with a series of nightly demonstrations last week around Parliament that resulted in clashes with riot police officers and a number of arrests. Even opposition leaders have bemoaned the way harder-right groups have infiltrated the demonstrations, and there has been a small surge in violence against gay men and lesbians, with some beatings and angry, offensive words on social media. Two weeks ago, a Dutch-born man walking with his partner in Paris was beaten up. The man, Wilfred de Bruijn, posted a photograph of his bloodied face on his Facebook page, calling it “the face of Homophobia.” It has been shared thousands of times. Last week, two gay bars, in Bordeaux and Lille, were attacked, and a same-sex couple was attacked Saturday in Nice outside a gay nightclub. As a result of the violent surge against the measure, French President François Hollande and the legislature have pushed to approve the bill quickly, hoping to pass it and ""put the matter behind them,"" according to presidential aides. But even with an accelerated process and a vote scheduled for Tuesday, controversy and violent rhetoric persist: On Monday, Manuel Valls, the interior minister, accused protesters and political opponents on the right of “unleashing homophobic speech.” Speaking to Europe 1 radio, Mr. Valls conceded that opponents of the bill were “numerous,” but said they represented “a minority compared to the millions” who voted for Mr. Hollande as president a year ago, when he promised to pass a same-sex marriage bill in his first year in office. Also on Monday, the president of the National Assembly received a letter threatening “war” and attacks on Socialist lawmakers if the lower house approved the legislation, the French news media reported. The letter was said to have contained gunpowder. Despite the heated rhetoric, equal rights supporters remain confident that the measure will pass, and that popular support will eventually overcome the small, but vocal, minority of conservative and religious groups who oppose it. As the Times notes, more than half of the countries in the European Union have civil union or marriage equality laws on the books, and, it seems, momentum is on the side of equality, as Pierre Bréchon, a political scientist at the Grenoble Institute of Political Studies told the Times: “The movement is clear. It is gradual, but it is clear.” By Katie McDonough Katie McDonough is Salon's politics writer, focusing on gender, sexuality and reproductive justice.

"Experimental lakes reopening should shore up left-leaning support for Wynne - The Globe and Mail Skip to main content Search Newsletters Watchlist Home Watchlist For You Canada World Business Investing Personal Finance Opinion Politics Sports Life Arts Drive Real Estate Latest in Subscribe Digital access Digital + home delivery Experimental lakes reopening should shore up left-leaning support for Wynne analysis Experimental lakes reopening should shore up left-leaning support for Wynne Adam Radwanski Climate policy columnist and feature writer Published April 26, 2013 This article was published more than 11 years ago. Some information may no longer be current. Ontario Premier Kathleen Wynne announced this week that her government would reopen the northern Ontario research station controversially shuttered by Ottawa. Fred Lum/The Globe and Mail Share The bouquet of flowers arrived at the Ontario Premier's office on Thursday, along with a note. ""Thank you for your courageous work on the Experimental Lakes Area with the IISD,"" Elizabeth May had written to Kathleen Wynne. ""Canada is so grateful!"" Although it is debatable how much the federal Green Party Leader speaks for Canada, the gesture was indicative of the goodwill Ms. Wynne managed to get at a very low price. To call less than $2-million per year a rounding error, for a government that spends well over $100-billion annually, would be an insult to rounding errors. Yet that expenditure, to which Ms. Wynne implicitly committed at a press conference this week, should be enough to reopen the northern Ontario research station controversially shuttered by Ottawa. Provincial officials insist Ontario is serving as a facilitator, having reached out to both the federal and Manitoba governments to get the ball rolling to transfer the ELA to the Winnipeg-based International Institute for Sustainable Development. But Ms. Wynne seemed unable to resist a veiled shot at Stephen Harper's Conservatives when she made her announcement, describing hers as a government that ""believes in science, believes in evidence."" It's unlikely most Ontarians noticed, but for those who lament that Ottawa is at war with science – and hold up the abrupt closing of a facility world-renowned for its work examining the effects of freshwater contaminants – it undoubtedly resonated. Although hardly addressing her biggest challenges in trying to hold onto power in the next election, the contrast struck by Ms. Wynne plays well to the environmentalist chunk of her Liberals' governing coalition, helping prevent a percentage or two of the popular vote from bleeding to the provincial Greens. Beyond that, with the Liberals' best hope of seat gains in NDP-held ridings in downtown Toronto, it could also help lure a certain type of left-of-centre urbanite. That may not be entirely fair, given that New Democrat MPP Sarah Campbell, whose riding includes the ELA, called for Ms. Wynne to intervene. But with NDP Leader Andrea Horwath generally favouring a sort of pocketbook populism that plays better outside the city, Ms. Wynne's environmentalism is a little more noticeable. Not that saving experimental lakes attracted as much notice as, say, a debate about raising billions of dollars in new revenues to finance public transit. But at $2-million, with little risk, it offered pretty good political value for money. Please enable JavaScript to view this content.

""The strike caused unnecessary harm to Israeli travelers and tourists."" ""I always believed that competition is the key to improving the efficiency of the economy, to improving the service to the public and, first and foremost, to lowering prices,” he added. Netanyahu said, “This is what guided us in the reform we led in the cellular phones, which led to a dramatic decrease in prices, this is what we are doing now in opening the flight market for competition, and we will continue to make additional reforms to break up monopolies and increase competition.” ""I'm sure that this is the right way to ensure that Israel will be a vibrant and dynamic economy that will benefit all its citizens,"" Netanyahu concluded. Earlier, Israeli airlines agreed to end the strike that began Sunday morning after reaching an agreement with the Finance Ministry. Under the agreement reached Monday, the government will cover 98% of Israeli airlines’ security costs. Finance Minister Yair Lapid previously declared that the strike would not change the government’s decision to approve the deal with the EU. “’Open Skies’ are a done deal,” he said.

A corner meeting of Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) , held in the wake of coming May 11 polls, came under attack when at least three people, including a woman, were killed and around 20 others were injured in Karachi’s Lyari neighbourhood. The PPP candidate for PS-111, Adnan Baloch was among the injured. Earlier, at least two people were killed and more than 25 were injured in two separate blasts near the Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) election office in the city’s Orangi Town area. According to police, the bombings were carried out through planted devices in Qasba Colony locality. Speaking to Dawn.com, DIG district West Zafar Abbas Bukhar said the first bomb was exploded outside the MQM election office while the second one followed it outside a nearby Shia Imambargah in the area. Bukhari also confirmed the number of casualties. The twin explosions were so loud that they were heard from far away and damaged the nearby buildings and vehicles. A complete power blackout was reported in the area after the explosions and injured were shifted to Abbasi Shaheed Hospital and Qatar Hospital Saturday’s blast made a tally of five terrorist attacks in as many days in the metropolis, which is the financial hub of the country. At least 26 people have died in these attacks. Although no group has so far claimed responsibility of both the blasts but the outlawed Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) vowed to target secular political forces of the country – PPP, ANP and MQM. The banned outfit had claimed responsibilities of the Thursday and Friday attacks, targeting MQM and ANP respectively. The MQM announced to observe a day of mourning throughout the Sindh province on Sunday. The party appealed to the masses to keep all businesses and transport shut today. A high level security meeting was also called at the Karachi’s Rangers headquarters to review the overall law and order and formulate a fresh counter-terrorism strategy. Around 11 people were killed and over 50 others injured when a bomb blast hit the election meeting of ANP candidate Bashir Jan in Karachi on Friday. Whereas, at least five people died and more than ten others injured when a blast ripped through an election office of the MQM in Karachi’s Nusart Bhutto Colony on Thursday night . On Tuesday, the blast near People’s Chowrangi in North Nazimabad had left at least five people dead and 15 others injured. The spike in violence targeting the said political parties has raised concerns for law and order as the May 11 general elections draw closer.

Hanabusa to challenge Sen. Schatz in Hawaii Catalina Camia, USA TODAY Daniel Inouye's dying wish was that Rep. Colleen Hanabusa replace him in the U.S. Senate. But the congresswoman was passed over by Hawaii Gov. Neil Abercrombie for the appointment when the iconic Inouye died last year. Now, Hanabusa appears ready to challenge appointed Sen. Brian Schatz in a Democratic primary in 2014. Hanabusa's candidacy is being reported by the Honolulu Star-Advertiser . A former state Senate president, Hanabusa won her seat in the U.S. House in 2010. Schatz, who was Abercrombie's lieutenant governor, raised $1.1 million in the first three months of the year for next year's race. The Hawaii Senate seat is one of 21 that Democrats have to defend next year, but it is likely to stay in the party's hands because of the state's Democratic tilt.

DARRYL DYCK/The Canadian Press Share When the Queen of the North hit Gil Island, the officer in charge of 
navigating the large passenger vessel thought the doomed ship was half a 
kilometre off-shore. ""All I wanted was not to be there,"" Karl Lilgert told a hushed courtroom, as 
he recounted his reaction to suddenly seeing trees out of the corner of his eye, 
while fiddling with the radar on the boat's bridge. ""I was so shocked. I was so 
certain I was three cables [0.5 km] off the coast. The trees were a reality I 
was not going to accept. But when I looked back, there they were."" Mr. Lilgert's admission Tuesday that he had no idea the Queen of the North 
was on course for the large, rocky island capped a dramatic day of testimony by 
the 59-year-old fourth officer, who broke down in tears several times, as he 
relived the early morning sinking of the Queen of the North seven years ago. Facing two charges of criminal negligence causing death arising from the 
deaths of two passengers, Mr. Lilgert is providing his version of events for the 
first time. As the Queen of the North headed south from Prince Rupert through the narrow 
Inland Passage, Mr. Lilgert said he asked for a course alteration to be made in 
the direction of Gil Island, to ensure the ship avoided a small fishing boat on 
the port side. Although a squall was moving through at the same time, Mr. Lilgert told Crown 
prosecutor Michel Huot he was not concerned by his decision to change course. ""I 
didn't think the squall was going to interfere with the speed and direction I 
was going. I believed my position was fine."" When Mr. Huot expressed skepticism about the wisdom of Mr. Lilgert's 
decision, noting that the island was obscured on the radar screen by ""clutter"" 
from the squall, the accused replied: ""I didn't believe for a moment that we 
were going to be anywhere near Gil Island. I was travelling towards it, not at 
it. Even if everything went wrong, we would still be three cables away. … I had 
no idea those trees were going to show up."" Normally, the southward ferry route requires a course alteration near the 
Sainty Point Light northeast of Gil Island to avoid coming close to the 
island. But Mr. Lilgert said he delayed the change for three extra 
minutes because of concerns over a tow boat in the area. This took place before 
the second alteration that occurred just ahead of Gil Island. Asked by Mr. Huot why he chose three minutes for the delay, Mr. 
Lilgert said: ""It's a nice number, a random number. It would be no danger to Gil 
Island."" Mr. Huot also asked numerous questions about Mr. Lilgert's 
relationship with quartermaster Karen Briker, who was under his command on the 
bridge when the ship hit the island and sank. It was the first time the two had 
been alone since an intense extramarital affair between them had 
ended. Mr. Lilgert denied that either had any strong emotions over their 
past relationship, saying he couldn't remember deliberately not talking to Ms. 
Briker when the two were in the crew canteen before heading up to the bridge on 
the fateful night. ""She was just another deckhand, a good friend,"" he told the 
B.C. Supreme Court trial. Earlier, Mr. Lilgert described how, after he saw the trees, he 
frantically ordered Ms. Briker to switch off autopilot so he could manually 
steer the vessel away from Gil Island at the last moment. ""She said, 'I don't 
know how,' and my heart just sank."" Finally, the switch was made, and Mr. Lilgert, with steering 
wheel in hand, tried to avoid the island. ""I remember watching the rudder and 
watching the trees go by."" He broke down on the witness stand, weeping 
uncontrollably, prompting his lawyer Glen Orris to walk over and console 
him. Mr. Lilgert wiped more tears away as he told of sitting in the 
lifeboat, hearing numerous head counts being made of passengers and crew. They 
seemed to indicate all had been accounted for. ""I was quite relieved we had 
everyone,"" he said in a low voice, then wept. He cried for a third time, after admitting that, in hindsight, he 
could have used one of the ship's steering mechanisms without auto-pilot being 
turned off. ""There was so much more I could have done."" Mr. Lilgert also told of the devastating personal toll he has 
suffered since the Queen of the North went down. He's had to move from Prince 
Rupert, he's been fired by BC Ferries, his marriage has ended, and he's been 
shunned by many former friends and crewmates. The trial continues on Wednesday. Please enable JavaScript to view this content.

The incident took place at a Sunni camp where demonstrations have been held since January. https://p.dw.com/p/18L9K Image: Reuters Advertisement Military sources said the exchange of gunfire broke out when Iraqi security forces raided an anti-government demonstration camp in Hawijah, outside the northern city of Kirkuk at around 5 a.m. local time (0200 UTC). According to news agency Reuters, ensuing clashes left six troops and twenty protesters dead. A further 70 people were reportedly injured. Army officials said the operation had been aimed at Sunni militants from a group known as the Naqshbandiya Army, and that security forces only opened fire after they were fired upon. Protesters offered a different account, however, insisting that they were unarmed when the army instigated clashes. ""[Security forces] invaded our sit-in today, burned the tents and opened fire indiscriminately and killed and wounded dozens of protesters,"" Abdulmalik al-Juburi, a leader of the Hawijah sit-in told news agency AFP.

Rabbi Levinger and his wife Miriam were among the founders of the Israeli city of Kiryat Arba and of the renewed Jewish community of Hevron. Miriam Levinger spoke to Arutz Sheva about her memories of those years. “We were always working on things related to the land of Israel,” she said. “In the beginning with Rabbi Tzvi Yehuda Kook’s guidance, of course.” “My husband always strove to do things honestly and with self-sacrifice,” she added. At first, Rabbi Levinger was considered a curiosity, she said. “Today, thank G-d we have the young generation, we see that Zionism brought forth generation after generation.” “In 1956 we were a tiny, disliked minority, today we see the entire, wonderful young generation. We have great-grandchildren in settlements, and that shows the righteousness of our path,” she said. The Levingers remain active to this day. “My husband Moshe meets every week with a young people from the Nahala movement who are planning to create ten new outposts soon,” she said. “We look to the past with satisfaction, and to the future with joy, and we see that it was all worth it. Despite the troubles that were, when you see today’s young generation you understand what a success it was,” she added. Regarding international criticism of Israeli settlement, she said, “My husband always told the young people that the fact that the nations of the world go wild over every hut that is built shows how important it is.” Found a mistake?

The yeshiva, Netivot Yosef, was vandalized by Arabs who broke into the town several weeks ago. The vandals destroyed books and several objects, smashed doors and furniture – and defaced a Torah scroll in the synagogue. The synagogue was located in a compound that housed, among other institutions, the local yeshiva. During his visit to the town, Danon was briefed on the incident by the Rosh Yeshiva, Rabbi Shabtai Sabato, deputy Binyamin Regional Council head Roni Snir, and Binyamin Regional Council Education Director Rabbi Yaakov Libby. Danon said that lessons on improving security needed to be learned from the incident. Danon added that the public needed to speak out on this incident of vandalism, and make their protests heard. “What would have happened if they had broken into a Muslim or Christian institution,” Danon asked rhetorically. Avi Ro'eh, head of the Yesha Council and director of the Mateh Binyamin Regional Council, sad that the incident was a “very serious one, because it involved not only vandalism and destruction of a place of worship, but an invasion of a school.

Song Xue, the deputy chief of staff of China's navy, told state media the country's next aircraft carrier needs to be larger and carry more fighter jets. China already has one carrier, the Liaoning , a refitted Soviet-built vessel that went into commission in September, in what was a symbolic step for China's growing military prowess. Song, whose comments appeared Wednesday in the official Xinhua news agency, did not say if the new carriers would be purchased or domestically built. China's growing naval strength has raised concern among its neighbors, many of whom are involved in worsening disputes with Beijing over maritime territory. Beijing has stressed that the expansion of its naval forces is no threat to its neighbors. It says the Liaoning will be used mainly for scientific research and training missions. Although China has already conducted successful test landings of fighter jets on the Liaoning, the carrier is not expected to be fully operational for several years.

All rights reserved. Hyundai Pulls Attempted Suicide Ad By Susanna Kim April 26, 2013 Hyundai apologized and pulled an ad that portrayed a man trying to commit suicide by running his automobile in a closed garage. The one-minute video was made by a German ad agency, and brought to the attention of CNET by a woman whose father had committed suicide by that method. In a statement, Hyundai Motor Europe said, ""Hyundai Motor deeply and sincerely apologizes for the offensive viral film. The film runs counter to our values as a company and as members of the community. We are very sorry for any offense or distress the video caused."" In Photos: Controversial, Racy Celebrity Ads The video advertises the new hydrogen-powered Hyundai ix35 cars, which have 100 percent water emissions. In the ad, a middle-aged man breathes in what appears to be car exhaust fumes in his car that is parked in a garage. But hours later and without any words, he emerges from the garage. The words displayed at the end of the ad are: ""The New ix35 With 100% Water Emissions."" At least one commentator on YouTube pointed out the effectiveness of the advertisement's message. ""I know how controversial this advert is becoming and whether you agree with it or not it's worked,"" the comment read. ""You cannot deny that. The job is done and everyone now knows about the new Hyundai with 100 percent water emissions. Advertising at its best.""

The Canadian Press Published April 29, 2013 This article was published more than 11 years ago. Some information may no longer be current. William Orders, the pilot involved in a tragic hang-gliding accident near Agassiz, B.C. Share The man accused of criminal negligence causing death and obstruction of justice in connection with the hang-gliding death of a B.C. woman has pleaded not guilty. Pilot William Orders made the plea Monday at an arraignment hearing in Provincial Court in Chilliwack. ""It's a complicated case, a serious case,"" Jeff Campbell, the lawyer for Mr. Orders, told reporters outside the court. Mr. Campbell said his client now will be preparing for his six-day trial set for Oct. 22. Mr. Orders, 50, was charged earlier this year with criminal negligence causing the death of 27-year-old Lenami Godinez-Avila, who fell about 300 metres moments after taking off from a mountain top during a tandem flight piloted by Mr. Orders. She fell to her death on April 28 last year. It took searchers about eight hours to find her body on a mountainside in the Fraser Valley. Mr. Orders was charged with obstruction for allegedly swallowing the memory card from his camera after the woman fell. He was held in custody until police recovered the memory card. Mr. Orders earlier apologized to the Mexican student's family, saying he would not return to hang gliding. He said he was sincerely and deeply sorry, adding he wished the day would have turned out differently. Please enable JavaScript to view this content.

Yesterday, the Constitutional Court became the third court to shoot down an application from Walker seeking to challenge the powers of the OCG. Walker had filed an application challenging the authority of the OCG to probe the Customs Department and to make a recommendation to the director of public prosecutions to bring charges against him. The OCG had launched an investigation into allegations that the Customs Department had allowed the export of scrap metal despite a ban on the industry at the time. Walker was charged in January 2011 with failure to comply in the prescribed time with a request from the OCG and obstructing an investigation of the office. Headlines Delivered to Your Inbox Sign up for The Gleaner’s morning and evening newsletters. The former customs boss, who was represented by Dr Lloyd Barnett and Keith Bishop, challenged the move in the Supreme Court and the Court of Appeal but those applications were dismissed. He then took the matter to the Constitutional Court which heard the application and reserved its judgment. Yesterday, the Constitutional Court comprising Justices Lennox Campbell, Bryan Sykes and Jennifer Straw dismissed Walker's motion. View the discussion thread.

Yoni Kempinski Apr 24, 2013, 6:15 AM (GMT+3) US Embassy High Tech Haredim Academia Dr. Ayanna Howrd Georiga Institute Of Technology Machon Lustig Students at Machon Lustig Yoni Kempinski This week, a delegation on behalf of the U.S. embassy in Israel visited Machon Lustig, a center of academic studies for hareidi-religious women which is located in Ramat Gan and is one of the campuses of the Jerusalem College of Technology. The purpose of the visit was to get to know the students and understand the impact they have had on technological developments in the defense industry and in major high-tech companies, both in Israel and around the world. The students at Machon Lustig recently developed a unique microchip for the aerospace defense industry, and have developed studies in many fields in high-tech. One of the visitors was Dr. Ayanna Howard from the Georgia Institute of Technology who told Arutz Sheva , “Women and men each make up about 50% of the population, but when you look at the sciences that’s not equal, and in order to have a diverse culture you need to have representation that’s equal to the population.” One of the things that made visiting Machon Lustig significant, she said, is the fact that the hareidi community “has some of the same issues in terms of encouraging women that have very strong family values but still look outside in terms of improving technology. And those two are not conflicting goals,” stressed Howard. According to Stuart Hershkowitz, Senior Advisor to the President of the Jerusalem College of Technology, the visit proved that hareidi women “are fully capable of studying high-tech. We want to show them the potential, what can be done and what has been accomplished so far.” Found a mistake?

MOSCOW, April 27 (RIA Novosti) – A playground ordered for a village in Russia’s Far East by President Vladimir Putin during a conversation with a young girl as part of Thursday’s televised Q&A session with “the people” is already in place, a regional official said on Saturday. Putin was asked on Thursday by a young pigtailed girl from a large family, many of whom are adoptees, to help provide a playground for her village in the Far East Primorsky region. The president promise to do so, and word came back during his over 4-hour Q&A session that the order had already been received by the local administration. Work began the same day. On Saturday, administration officials told RIA Novosti the playground was already up and ready for use. Putin has made a habit of granting petitions during his live Q&A shows. In late 2008, as prime minister, he invited a young girl from Siberia to come and visit the Kremlin after she asked him for a new dress.

The allegations of torture brought a statement of concern from British Prime Minister David Cameron, but Dubai authorities have denied any wrongdoing. The trio, identified as Suneet Jeerh, Grant Cameron and Karl Williams, were arrested last July with what police said was the synthetic drug known as Spice. The men deny the charges. They claimed they faced abuse by police, including electric shocks and beatings. Monday's conviction and sentence can be appealed within 15 days. The court also ordered the men deported after they complete their sentences.

The Chennai Corporation, on Friday, passed a resolution to this effect. The contractors are mainly those who have not begun work on the mega city development projects in the Tondiarpet zone. On December 28, 2012, the Corporation council had approved a Rs. 9.7-crore package for 24 projects. Most of these were for integrated road development. However, the contractors given these jobs did not begin work even 73 days after the issuance of work orders, Corporation officials said. The mega city development mission includes improving civic infrastructure with a grid system of roads, more streetlights, street furniture, footpaths and improved stormwater drains. Under the first phase, a grid system was planned for all eight zones comprising the expanded areas of the Corporation. A total of Rs. 333.27 crore was approved by the Corporation for implementation of the grid system covering 360 roads. Over 427 roads were covered in the second phase of the mega city development mission in all 15 zones of the city.

Rebels have held several suburbs ringing the southern and eastern parts Damascus for months, but they have been struggling to maintain their positions against a ground offensive backed by fierce army shelling and air strikes in recent weeks. ""The disaster has struck, the army entered Otaiba. The regime has managed to turn off the weapons tap,"" a fighter from the town told Reuters via Skype. ""The price of a bullet will go from 50 Syrian pounds to 1,000 Syrian pounds now, but we must pay and retake it. It's the main if not the only route."" Rebels said they pulled out of Otaiba, a gateway to the eastern rural suburbs of Damascus known as al-Ghouta, in the early hours after more than 37 days of fighting in which they accused the government of using chemical weapons against them twice. The government has denied using chemical weapons and accused rebels in turn of firing them in Aleppo. Rebels used Otaiba for eight months as their main supply route to Damascus for weapons brought in from the Jordanian border, where Saudi Arabia and other private donors are believed to be sending in arms. Government forces pushed in with tanks and soldiers. ""Now all the villages will start falling one after another, the battle in Eastern Ghouta will be a war of attrition,"" another fighter in the area said, speaking by Skype. More than two years into their struggle to end four decades of Assad family rule, the rebels remain divided by struggles over ideology and fighting for power Rebels fighting in Otaiba said they sent a distress call to brigades in other parts of Ghouta but it went unanswered by other units with whom they compete for influence and weapons. ""To all mujahedeen (holy warriors): If Otaiba falls, the whole of Eastern Ghouta will fall ... come and help ,"" part of the message sent to fighters said. The army appears to have been advancing on fronts across Syria in recent weeks, even in northern provinces where rebels seized large swathes of territory. MINARET COLLAPSES Most critically, it has made gains around Damascus and the Lebanese-Syrian border - critical to linking the capital to coastal provinces that are Assad's stronghold. The coast is an enclave of Assad's minority Alawite sect, an offshoot of Shi'ite Islam. Alawites have dominated Syria's power structures during four decades of Assad family rule. Rebels, mostly from the Sunni Muslim majority, have seized territory in northern and southern Syria, and hold about half of Aleppo, the country's biggest city. But Assad's forces have kept control of the capital Damascus and most major cities. Elsewhere in Damascus, two mortar bombs hit the government-held suburb of Jaramana, killing seven and wounding more than 25, activists and state media said. State news agency SANA blamed the attack on ""terrorists"", the term it commonly uses to describe Assad's armed opponents. Some rebel units condemned the attack on Jaramana. ""Our brigade loudly condemns these criminal acts, which have nothing to do with Islam in any way,"" the Saad bin Abada al-Khudraji brigade said. Islamist rebel units said on Wednesday they had launched an offensive on the coastal province of Latakia, a move which could further stoke sectarian tensions in a war that has increasingly divided the country along religious and ethnic lines. Islamist fighters said they had fired two rockets that hit the town of Qurdaha, the birthplace and burial site of Assad's father, Hafez al-Assad, who ruled Syria for 30 years. Residents in Latakia province who spoke to Reuters by Skype said the rockets hit outside Qurdaha, in a rural area called Slunfeh. It is impossible to verify the account due to government restrictions on media access in Syria. Moscow was flying more Russians home after delivering humanitarian aid to Latakia, the Emergencies Ministry said. It was one of several government flights laid on in the past months by Russia, a long-standing arms supplier to Damascus. The conflict has cost more than 70,000 lives and has also damaged or destroyed many archaeological and architectural treasures, some of them U.N. world heritage sites, such as Aleppo's Old City where the mosque is located. The 1,000-year-old minaret of Aleppo's Umayyad Mosque has collapsed due to clashes between Syrian rebels and Assad's forces, activists and state media said on Wednesday. The opposing parties blamed the other for the toppling of the minaret, which predated the medieval-era mosque it stood in. Fighting has ravaged the Old City's stone-vaulted alleyways for months and had already reduced much of the mosque to rubble. SANA accused the Nusra Front, an al Qaeda-linked rebel group, of bringing down the minaret. Opposition groups said army tank fire was to blame. © Thomson Reuters 2013 Show full article Comments Track Latest News Live on NDTV.com and get news updates from India and around the world Follow us: Syria Civil War Related News In Sudan, 150 Families Risk Lives To Feed Each Other From Syria, A Haunting Photo Of Children Trying To Save Baby Sister 39 Including Children Killed In Arms Depot Blast In Syria's Idlib Trending News Maharashtra Ex Minister Baba Siddique Shot Dead Near Son's Office In Mumbai Siraj Takes Charge As DSP In Telangana.

PM hails Thatcher in speech outside Number 10 as Parliament is recalled David Cameron: 'We have lost a great leader, great PM and great Briton' Tony Blair: 'She was kind and was always immensely supportive to me' Ed Miliband: 'A unique figure who reshaped the politics of a generation' Boris Johnson: 'She ended defeatism and pessimism of post-war period' Lord Tebbit: 'Her life must have been increasingly empty in recent years' Lord Saatchi: 'She is immortal because her values are timeless, eternal' By James Chapman for the Daily Mail Published: 20:01 EDT, 8 April 2013 | Updated: 11:48 EDT, 9 April 2013 e-mail 54 View comments David Cameron hailed Margaret Thatcher as ‘the patriot Prime Minister’ with a ‘lionhearted love for this country’ last night as he led tributes to the woman hailed as Britain’s greatest peacetime leader. Mr Cameron, speaking on the steps of 10 Downing Street said the country had lost a ‘great leader, a great Prime Minister and a great Briton’. Old colleagues and former foes alike united to acknowledge her position as the most towering political figure since Sir Winston Churchill, a pioneer as the first women prime minister and an international champion of free market economics. Full of praise: Prime Minister David Cameron makes a statement outside 10 Downing Street in central London yesterday, after Baroness Thatcher died at the age of 87 following a stroke Mr Cameron cut short a trip to Europe to return to London following the news and said Parliament would be recalled from recess tomorrow so politicians could pay tribute. He said: ‘Margaret Thatcher didn’t just lead our country – she saved our country. And we should never forget that the odds were stacked against her. She was the shopkeeper’s daughter from Grantham who made it to the highest office in the land. ‘There were people who said she couldn’t make it; who stood in her way; who said a woman couldn’t lead. She defied them all. ‘She will be remembered for the big political battles she fought. Taking on the union barons. Privatising industry. Unleashing enterprise. Rescuing the economy. Letting people buy their council homes. RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 2 Next A funeral fit for an Iron Lady: Route of Baroness Thatcher's... The woman who saved Britain...

Strengthening our defences. Helping to win the Cold War. Margaret Thatcher took a country that was on its knees and made Britain stand tall again.’ Mr Cameron said it could not be denied that Lady Thatcher ‘divided opinion’. ‘But if there is one thing that cuts through all of this – one thing that runs through everything she did – it was her lionhearted love for this country. She was the patriot Prime Minister and she fought for Britain’s interests every single step of the way. ‘Margaret Thatcher loved this country and served it with all she had. The big beasts of Lady Thatcher’s Cabinets joined in paying tribute yesterday. Lord Tebbit , former Tory Party chairman said: ‘It is a sadness that such an immense figure of the late 20th century should have gone – but perhaps a merciful release for her, from a life which must have been increasingly empty in recent years. Closing act: Lady Thatcher and husband Denis leave Number 10 on November 28, 1990 ‘She did indeed change Britain for the better – would that there was somebody like her to lead us again now! I am grateful to her for allowing me to serve her country in that way.’ Sir John Major , Lady Thatcher’s successor, said: ‘In government, the UK was turned around under – and in large measure because of – her leadership. Her reforms of the economy, trades union law, and her recovery of the Falkland Islands elevated her above normal politics, and may not have been achieved under any other leader. ‘Her outstanding characteristics will always be remembered by those who worked closely with her: courage and determination in politics, and humanity and generosity of spirit in private.’ Lord Heseltine , Cabinet minister and rival, said: ‘I am sorry to learn of Lady Thatcher’s death. The illness of her last years has been cruel and very difficult.’ Lord Lawson , her former Chancellor said: ‘Britain seemed doomed to continual economic decline. She changed all that and her tax reforms were emulated around the world. She did not surround herself with Yes-men but people who shared her ideas to rescue the economy. ‘I don’t want to be drawn on the difficulties at the end. I want to focus on the enormous achievement of her first ten years.’ Tories: Prime Minister David Cameron talks to Baroness Thatcher at 10 Downing Street in June 2010 Lord Howe , former Foreign Secretary, whose resignation speech led to Lady Thatcher’s downfall, commented: ‘Britain, when we came to office, was in the last chance saloon. People realised that we really had to do some rather difficult things.’  Asked about his personal relationship with her, he replied: ‘It was all a long time ago.’ Lord Saatchi , chairman of Centre for Policy Studies, set up by Lady Thatcher in 1974, declared: ‘Everyone wants to be immortal. Few are. Mrs Thatcher is. Why? Because her values are timeless, eternal. ‘She developed all the winning arguments of our time – free markets, low tax, a small state, independence, individuality, self-determination. The result was a revolution in economic policy and three election victories in a row.’ Lord Lamont , another former chancellor, said: ‘The name Margaret Thatcher will always be synonymous with the word “courage”. The word impossible barely existed for her. We shall not see her like again.’ Kenneth Clarke , now Minister without portfolio and one of Lady Thatcher’s Cabinet, said: ‘It was conviction politics. She had a strong idea of what she wanted to do and it was based on what she thought was the right thing to do.’ Lord Patten , former cabinet minister, now chairman of the BBC Trust, said: ‘She made Britain governable again. We should all recognise her huge contribution to the history and well-being of this country.’ Respect: Tony Blair (pictured yesterday in Pennsylvania), who Lady Thatcher once described as her 'greatest achievement', was by far the warmest of senior Labour figures, hailing her as a 'towering political figure' Lord Archer , former Tory deputy chairman, said: ‘The thing that always stands out is her extreme loyalty. She never forgot her friends, ever. She loved this country so dearly and was steely in her determination to see it great again. And that is what she did.’ Justin Welby , the Archbishop of Canterbury, noted Lady Thatcher’s religious faith. ‘It is right that today we give thanks for a life devoted to public service, acknowledging also the faith that inspired and sustained her,’ he said. Tony Blair , who Lady Thatcher once described as her ‘greatest achievement’, was by far the warmest of senior Labour figures, hailing her as a ‘towering political figure’. ‘Very few leaders get to change not only the political landscape of their country but of the world. Margaret was such a leader. Her global impact was vast. 'And some of the changes she made in Britain were, in certain respects at least, retained by the 1997 Labour government, and came to be implemented by governments around the world,’ he said. ‘As a person she was kind and generous spirited and was always immensely supportive to me as Prime Minister although we came from opposite sides of politics.’ Thoughts: Ed Miliband (pictured yesterday in Ipswich, Suffolk) said she would 'remain a controversial figure' Ed Miliband , Labour leader, said she would ‘always remain a controversial figure’. But he added: ‘She will be remembered as a unique figure. She reshaped the politics of a whole generation. She was Britain’s first woman Prime Minister. She moved the centre ground of British politics and was a huge figure on the world stage.’ Gordon Brown , who angered some Labour MPs when he invited Lady Thatcher for tea in Number Ten, hailed her ‘many decades of service’. ‘She will be remembered not only for being Britain’s first female Prime Minister and holding the office for 11 years, but also for the determination and resilience with which she carried out all her duties throughout her public life.’ Boris Johnson , London Mayor, said Lady Thatcher had ‘ended the defeatism and pessimism of the post-war period and unleashed a spirit of enterprise’. ‘She fought against the clubby, cosy, male-dominated consensus of both main parties – and she won.’ MAILONLINE & DAILY MAIL CAMPAIGN: HOW TO MAKE YOUR VOICE HEARD If you believe Lady Thatcher deserves a state funeral, and want the Government to know, sign this online petition and submit it to us.

www.tinyurl.com/josettebl PETION-VILLE, Haiti - The French-speaking Caribbean island of Guadeloupe confirmed its commitment to working more closely with its neighbor countries and territories in the affairs of the region. Josette Borel-Lincertin, president of the Regional Council of Guadeloupe, affirmed the French department's commitment to collaboration while participating in the 5th Summit of the Heads of State and Government of the Association of Caribbean States (ACS), currently underway in Haiti at the Karibe Hotel and Convention Center - April 23-25, 2013. Since its establishment, the Association of Caribbean States (ACS) organized four Summits of Heads of State and Government, which took place in Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago, in August 1995; Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, in April 1999; Margarita Island, Venezuela, in December 2001; and Panama City, Republic of Panama, in July 2005. The theme of this year's summit, held for the first time in the Republic of Haiti, is ""Revitalizing the Vision of the Association of Caribbean States for a Stronger and More United Greater Caribbean"". The summit has focused on issues such as sustainable tourism, air and maritime transport, trade, and disaster risk reduction. The summit outcomes are expected to propel sustainable development efforts in Haiti and the wider Caribbean. By participating for the first time as an associate member of the ACS, Guadeloupe's commitment to regional development represents part of the international commitments of France in the Caribbean. Borel-Lincertin asserted ""this is an important step towards the diplomatic representation of Guadeloupe within the region, thereby strengthening our capacity to take part in the dialogue with other Caribbean states and to forge a collective voice for regional development."" Borel-Lincertin is taking part in the summit alongside the French Minister of French Overseas Affairs, Victorin Lurel, and the French Ambassador of regional cooperation for the Caribbean and Guyanas, Fred Constant. The Guadeloupe delegation is taking advantage of its participation at the summit to meet with Haitian partners on key projects to foster regional cooperation - in particular the construction of a French high school under an agreement between the French Overseas Department of Guadeloupe, the Government of Haiti and the Association of French Regions. © Copyright 2013 by thebahamasweekly.com Top of Page News Feed Receive our Top Stories Preview | Powered by CommandBlast Caribbean News Latest Headlines Jamaicaâs agro-processing sector being enhanced by joint CDB, EU, JBDC project Africa in My Skin by Dominican Republic poet Rafael Nino FÃ©liz, published as trilingual edition Pandemic is pushing Latin America and the Caribbean more off track in ending child labour CDEMA and CDB partner to enhance Emergency Data Collection Capacity in the Caribbean CROSQ Supporting the Sustainable Development Goals through Accreditation",thebahamasweekly.com - Guadeloupe Committed to Caribbean Cooperation.

Apr 24, 2013, 08:30am EDT Updated Jul 8, 2013, 12:12pm EDT This article is more than 10 years old. Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin As a consumer with seemingly endless options, what compels you to choose one brand over another? You probably think your decisions are driven by the products and services offered by a particular company--but what’s really leading you to purchase from, recommend, and stay loyal that brand is its reputation. According to Reputation Institute , a global private consulting firm based in New York, reputation is the emotional bond that companies have with stakeholders. ""It’s defined by the level of trust, admiration, respect and good feeling stakeholders have towards a company,"" says Anthony Johndrow, a managing partner at the firm. Johndrow says he is seeing the enterprise play a growing role in driving consumers’ decisions and behaviors. “Greater access to and demand for information about the companies behind products is changing the way consumers relate to companies,” he says. “Similarly, there is increasing focus on aspects beyond products and services. Consumers are more and more interested in issues such as transparency, corporate governance and social responsibility.” Reputation Institute found that 55% of consumers would definitely buy products from companies with strong reputations; and 59% would be willing to say something positive to others about it. Meanwhile, for companies with weak reputations, only 7% are willing to recommend them. “We live in a time when word of mouth is the number one driver of sales and competitive advantage,” he says. “Investing in reputation will pay off on the bottom line.” Johndrow says many corporate leaders are beginning to understand why reputation is emerging as the No. 1 driver of value, and how crucial is it to their businesses. “They understand that people care about more than just the products they make. To deal with this new marketplace reality, companies need to build the capability to tell a broader story – more about who they are than what they sell.” To find out which U.S. corporations are doing this particularly well, Reputation Institute conducted an online study among 4,719 consumers to measure their perceptions of the 150 largest companies that they were “somewhat” or “very” familiar with. Each company earned a “RepTrak Pulse” score of 0 to 100, representing an average measure of people’s feelings–or reputation–for a company. The scores were statistically derived from four emotional indicators: trust, esteem, admiration, and good feeling. Reputation Institute then analyzed what it calls the seven dimensions of corporate reputation. That’s where it found that perceptions of the enterprise (workplace, governance, citizenship, financial performance and leadership) trumped product perceptions (products and services plus innovation) in driving behaviors. In Pictures: America’s 25 Most Reputable Companies As it turned out, The Walt Disney Company blew everyone else out of the water this year. The information and mass media giant’s score totaled 80.75, which was 5.07 points higher than last year. Disney—which is back on the top 10 list after falling off in 2012—earned its No. 1 rank by performing strongly in all of the dimensions that influence reputation. It led the pack in every category except “products,” in which it earned the second highest score. In 2012 the 90-year-old Burbank, Calif.-based company held the No. 17 spot. “Disney rebounded to an ‘excellent’ Pulse score in 2013, after dropping to ‘average’ last year,” Johndrow explains. “Consumers’ rational connection with Disney has been largely stable, and perceptions of the company’s performance on governance improved significantly in 2013. Compared with peers such as Time Warner and Google, Walt Disney outperformed across all dimensions of reputation with the biggest leads being in governance and citizenship, two key drivers of reputation.” A spokesperson for the company says:  “As one of the world’s best known companies, we continually strive to earn the respect of our consumers, our employees and our shareholders not only for what we achieve, but for how we do it. A great reputation is a reflection of the quality and integrity of a company's people and products and we are extremely proud of both."" No. 2 Intel also returned to the top 10 list this year. The tech firm earned a score of 80.05—jumping 6.82 points and 28 spots from 2012. It ranked among the top 5 in four of the seven dimensions. “Consumers’ rational connection with the company has been largely stable,” Johndrow says. “Compared with peers, Intel does very well in products, governance and performance – two of three key drivers of reputation,” he adds. “Intel also outperforms in innovation, citizenship and leadership.” Paul Bergevin, vice president of global communications at Intel, says a company’s reputation is a corporate asset, and protecting and enhancing that asset is a critical business need.  “Over many decades, Intel has earned a strong reputation because our technology has created the backbone for new industries and changed and enhanced the quality of people’s lives,” he says. “But just as important to our reputation is our active and transparent commitment to corporate responsibility.  As a global technology and business leader, we are committed to doing the right things, the right way. For Intel, that includes adhering to our long-held company values that emphasize integrity and building a great place to work, among others, and to our external work in education, the environment, and community engagement through volunteerism.” In Pictures: America’s 25 Most Reputable Companies Continue reading on page 2 . Amazon took the No. 3 spot this year. The Seattle-based e-commerce behemoth earned a pulse score of 79.95—up 1.31 points from 2012, when it ranked 5 th . “Consumers seem to be rewarding Amazon for their exceptional customer focus,” Johndrow says. “The emotional connection [consumer have with the company] has remained high after making a leap in 2011 when it was the No. 1 most reputable company in the U.S.” Amazon ranked among the top 5 in two of the seven dimensions. “Unsurprisingly, compared with peers, Amazon performs exceptionally well in innovation (No.2) and products (No. 1),” he says. The company also scores high, compared with the industry average, in governance, leadership and performance. “This well-rounded strength in dimensions of reputation is necessary to sustain strong connections over time,” Johndrow adds. “A reputation built on service alone would not be enough.” Deere & Co. and Dean Foods also joined the ranks of the top 10 this year, after building progressive gains since 2011. The four to fall off: No. 13 Procter & Gamble, No. 14 Kellogg’s, No. 24 Apple, and No. 35 PepsiCo. “Most of these are consumer packaged goods companies that traditionally do well,” Johndrow notes. Overall, the transport and logistics, consumer products, industrial products, food manufacturing, and computer industries scored highest. At the other end of the spectrum, energy, telecommunications, banking firms and diversified financial companies earned the weakest scores. ""Not surprisingly, the majority of the bottom ranking companies are financial services firms--the likes of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Bank of America, AIG and Goldman Sachs,” Johndrow says. Of the 30 companies that fall into this category, 19 rank in the bottom 50; 10 rank between 50 and 100; and only one, Berkshire Hathaway, ranks in the top 50. The least reputable company on the list this year: Halliburton. In dead last, the oilfield services firm earned a pulse score of 32.01, which is 5.61 points less than last year. The mortgage financiers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac did only slightly better with 35.65 points and 37.35 points, respectively. However—the companies saw significant reputation gains this year. Fannie Mae’s score increased by 6.14 points, while Freddie Mac was up a whopping 11.35 points. Others in the sector to see increases this year: Goldman Sachs and CitiGroup. In 2012 AIG was the biggest gainer, when its score grew by about 16 points thanks to tangible progress on shifting perceptions of its ethics and transparency. But things went downhill again this year. As the fourth least reputable company in 2013, AIG’s score dropped 10.75 points to 39.17. “Building a strong reputation takes time,” Johndrow says. “To earn trust and respect you need to consistently show that you will live up to your promises. To build a strong reputation companies need to deliver on these expectations through everyday work. But this is proving to be more and more difficult.” Reputation management is a discipline that must be built into the way a company operates. “A great way to start is to bring consumers and other stakeholders ‘into the room’ with you when you make business decisions,"" he concludes.

"South Korean minister praises Canadian resolve in face of war threats | CTV News Home FOLLOW ON Advertisement CANADA South Korean minister praises Canadian resolve in face of war threats Murray Brewster The Canadian Press Published Wednesday, April 24, 2013 6:16AM EDT Last Updated Wednesday, April 24, 2013 10:00AM EDT North Korean soldiers stand on steps overlooking the border village of Panmunjom, North Korea, which has separates the two Koreas since the Korean War, Wednesday, April 24, 2013. (AP / David Guttenfelder) Share: Reddit Share Text: GAPYEONG-GUN, South Korea -- Michael Ricketts has paid absolutely no attention to the sometimes earth-shaking events on the Korean peninsula since he chipped the mud of the place from his boots over six decades ago. The world may gawk at the vitriol coming out of Pyongyang, but the trim, soft-spoken, 85-year-old former lance corporal couldn't care less. ""When they're talking back and forth about what (Kim Jong Un) is going to do, I never even turn the news on to listen. I know it's there and that's all,"" said Ricketts, who spent the better part of his life after the Korean war as a cook at a hospital in a pastoral nook in Nova Scotia's Annapolis Valley. When his enlistment in the special force of Canadian volunteers raised for the Korean War ran out in 1952, he went home and closed the door on the unfinished war. ""I got out and forgot about it,"" said Ricketts. Although one of the first in line to join the 2nd Battalion, Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry in the summer of 1950, Ricketts did not embark with the unit when it first sailed for Korea. He missed the landmark battle of Kapyong April 24-26, 1951, by one week, arriving as a replacement for one of the casualties. At Kapyong, the Patricias defended the thundering hills around a hardscrabble farming town northeast of Seoul, despite being outnumbered eight to one. The outfit was awarded a U.S. presidential citation for turning back a communist Chinese offensive that threatened the South Korean capital. The battle was commemorated Wednesday by Canadian, British, Australian and New Zealand veterans, as well as Korean officials who said they drew inspiration today from the example of yesterday. ""Not to make the sacrifice and dedication of the UN Korean war veterans in vain, the Republic of Korea commits itself to hold a firm line on the North and (to) maintain a strong security posture,"" Park Sung Choon, South Korea's minister of patriots and veterans affairs, told the veterans during one of several services. The minister said he was impressed that Canadians chose to ignore recent North Korean threats of nuclear war and carried on with their pilgrimage, something that demonstrated ""their deep love for Korea."" Yet, Ricketts said he had to be talked into coming back. He was, however, circumspect about his experience and apologetic about not being more forthcoming. ""When the time came, I wanted to get out of here and that was it,"" he said. ""I didn't want nothing as a memory. I hope I'm not disappointing you."" Ricketts and his unit spent most of their time clinging to tangled, scrub brush hillsides under constant night attacks and shelling. When he went home, he not only left Korea behind, but also the men he served with, choosing not to keep in touch. Over the years, Ricketts has wondered what became of each member of his section and has spent most of his time during the last few days chatting with other veterans in hopes of getting a lead on each of them. In his pocket, he carries a dog-eared, brown, army service book. Inside, in addition to his personal details, are the names of the men he served with as a member of B Company, 2nd PPCLI in a little corner of hell called Kapyong. It was part of his job to keep track of their names and rifle serial numbers. Time is fleeting, he said. ""The only thing left would be, I would like to see some of the guys and find out if they're still alive or not. I never really thought about it before, because I kept busy. There was always something to do."" His experience in Korea left him with a lot of thoughts ""about life"" and that there had to be another way to live other than war and killing. ""I think that's what I accepted when I left here and I never thought about coming back to look at it, until these last three months,"" he said. ""The kids said, 'Dad you'd better go, you'll never be able to do it again.' ""I think that's the only reason I've (come) here, because if the kids hadn't said something, I would have never came."" So far, though, he hasn't found any of his old comrades.

"AIT subcontractors plan protests - Taipei Times Front Page Taiwan News Business Editorial & Opinion Sports World News Features Bilingual Pages Search Search All Front Page Taiwan News Business Editorial & Opinion Sports World News Features Bilingual Pages GO Home Taiwan News Sun, Apr 28, 2013 page3 AIT subcontractors plan protests By Shih Hsiu-chuan  /  Staff reporter Taiwanese subcontractors for the US-based Weston Solutions, Inc for the American Institute in Taiwan’s (AIT) new office compound in Taipei’s Neihu District (內湖) will proceed with their scheduled protest tomorrow because they have received no guarantee of payment of outstanding debts after months of negotiations with the general contractor. The planned protest will take place outside the AIT’s Taipei office on Xinyi Road, asking the AIT to take seriously the “severity of the hardship” endured by the Taiwan firms and requesting the US government to provide “equitable financial relief.” In their latest letter to AIT Director Christopher Marut, copies of which will be sent to Taiwanese officials, including President Ma Ying-jeou (馬英九), Minister of Foreign Affairs David Lin (林永樂) and Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin (郝龍斌), the Taiwanese firms urged Marut to “provide immediate notice to Washington of this matter.” The US Department of State’s Bureau of Overseas Buildings Operations (OBO) in 2009 directly contracted Weston Solutions for the first phase of the construction and the company was allocated US$54.5 million for the project, the AIT said. The three Taiwanese firms, Wei Chuan Arch Contracting Company, Cherng-Her Construction Co and Area Energy, said Weston Solutions owed them more than NT$470 million (US$15.89 million) dating to September 2011. “For more than a year, we’ve either taken out loans or contributed our own money to pay our workers and collective businesses, but we cannot afford it any more and we are facing problems with calls from debt collectors,” Wei Chuan Arch representative Tu Chung-jen (涂崇仁) said. Due to the payment problems, about 160 workers hired by the firms quit, were laid off or have been put on unpaid leave, while some collective companies pulled machinery and equipment out of the site, leading to a complete work stoppage, Tu said. Suspension of work since late last month has forced Weston Solutions to send a high-profile representative from the US to meet with the local firms on Thursday and the meeting made them believe that the US company “is already insolvent,” Tu said. The representative of Weston Solutions did not say when payments could be delivered, Tu said. “Instead, we were told to borrow money to handle emergencies and they said they would cover the interest,” he said. The local firms have hoped for intervention from the AIT, but the latter has maintained a hands-off attitude in the dispute, which it said was “an issue between Weston Solutions and its subcontractors.” In response to several previous letters by the local firms to Marut, the AIT on Wednesday replied for the first time in a letter by AIT Chief Management Officer Robert Bare. The AIT said it has forwarded their demands to Bureau of Overseas Buildings Operations and Weston Solutions and that the bureau has reiterated to Weston Solutions the importance of treating subcontractors fairly and making payments in accordance with contracts and laws. In the letter, the AIT said it understood their concerns, but reiterated that the contract dispute was  between Weston Solutions and subcontractors.

China in May launched “punishment” drills around Taiwan shortly after Lai’s inauguration, in what Beijing said was a response to “separatist acts,” sending heavily armed warplanes and staging mock attacks as state media denounced newly inaugurated Lai.
The May drills were dubbed “Joint Sword — 2024A” and drew concerns from capitals, including Washington.

In a letter of resignation made public Tuesday, Mohammed Foud Gadallah said he was quitting in protest at what he called an attempt to undermine the independence of Egypt's judiciary. The presidential adviser also complained there was ""no clear vision"" in running state affairs. He accused the Muslim Brotherhood of monopolizing decision-making and encroaching on the president and governing. Egypt's secular and liberal opposition has condemned Islamist-proposed legislation that would impose mandatory retirement on judges at age 60 instead of 70. The measure would force out many senior judges who have angered the Islamists by annulling election laws and acquitting officials who served under ousted president Hosni Mubarak. The Muslim Brotherhood recently staged a mass demonstration in Cairo to demand a ""purification"" of the judiciary. But now it also has referred the draft bill to a parliamentary committee for further study.

Sam Brownback signs sweeping anti-choice bill into law Among other anti-choice provisions, the bill states that ""life"" begins at fertilization under Kansas law By Katie McDonough Published April 22, 2013 4:19PM (EDT) (AP) -- Shares Facebook Twitter Reddit Email Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback has signed a sweeping antiabortion omnibus bill into law, reaffirming the state's current ban on abortion at 20 weeks (without exceptions for rape or serious fetal anomalies), blocking tax breaks for abortion providers, expanding ""conscience protections"" for anti-choice groups and writing into state law that life begins ""at fertilization."" It is, in effect, an antiabortion greatest-hits law. At the bill's signing ceremony, the arch-conservative governor applauded the Legislature for passing the measure with sweeping margins and announced :  ""All human life is sacred. It's beautiful. With this, we continue to build this culture of life in our state."" Sadly, states like Arkansas and North Dakota have moved the bar for judging antiabortion legislation so far to the right that Kansas' 20-week ban seems ""modest"" when compared to North Dakota's six-weeks and Arkansas' 12 weeks. But make no mistake: The Kansas law is equally dangerous for women, and still violates the accepted definition of fetal viability as defined by Roe v. Wade. Particularly worrisome for reproductive health advocates is the new law's language defining life ""at fertilization."" Critics like National Organization for Women lobbyist Elise Higgins argue that anti-choice groups could use the language to legally threaten and intimidate abortion care providers. ""We're disappointed but not surprised at the governor signing this overreaching legislation,"" Higgins told the Associated Press. Anti-choice advocates defended the language, saying that the new law might state that life begins ""at fertilization,"" but the language remains ""limited by decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court protecting access to abortion."" In addition to the medically inaccurate language defining life ""at fertilization,"" the new law also requires doctors to provide women with pseudoscience about ""risks"" associated with abortion. As the Associated Press reports: ""The bill also would require physicians to give women information that addresses breast cancer as a potential risk of abortion"" despite the fact that ""doctors convened by the National Cancer Institute a decade ago concluded that abortion does not raise the risk for developing the disease.""

CNN’s Pauline Surovell, author of “The Right to Choose: An American Story,” says the new bill is “very similar” to the one passed in Georgia last year. “It will require women to undergo an ultrasound and have the information about the fetus explained to them. It also bans abortions after 22 weeks, which is when most fetuses can survive outside the womb,” she says. “And if you’re an abortion provider, you will be subject to a $500 fine if you don’t report the abortions to the state. It’s a very similar bill to Georgia’s, which was ruled unconstitutional because of the reporting requirement.”
The bill, which takes effect in January, is one of several anti-choice laws passed in recent years that have been challenged in court.

Motorola was seeking royalties from Microsoft’s Xbox gaming system, which utilizes the company’s technology concerning video decoding wireless connectivity. Instead of the $4 billion per year Google had valued Motorola’s patents, the judge decided that the appropriate annual payment was closer to $1.8 million. [More from BGR: Samsung CEO defends decision to use two different CPUs for Galaxy S4 ] “This decision is good for consumers because it ensures patented technology committed to standards remains affordable for everyone,” David Howard, deputy general counsel for Microsoft, said in a statement to Bloomberg . [More from BGR: Next-gen Xbox will reportedly run on ‘core’ Windows 8, start at $299 ] Robart’s ruling comes as a significant blow to Google, which bought Motorola for $12.5 billion in 2011 . The company claimed it was interested in Motorola’s vast portfolio of patents , however the lower valuation now gives Google a weaker bargaining chip when negotiating licensing deals with other companies. Some analysts have argued that Google overpaid for the troubled vendor and today’s decision supports that notion. Motorola and Microsoft will return to the court room in August to argue whether or not Motorola failed to license Microsoft its standard-essential patent at fair terms.

"Fighting international crime is key to sustainable development, UN official says Subscribe Now ! My Account Sign In Sign Out Home :: Security :: Library :: News :: 2013 :: April :: Military WMD Intelligence Security Menu Systems Industry Operations Hot Documents News Reports Policy Budget Congress Links Space Homeland Security Fighting international crime is key to sustainable development, UN official says 22 April 2013 – International crime undermines sustainable development, hinders access to education and discourages investment opportunities, the head of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) said today, adding that disrupting the flow of illegal profits had become a crucial for successful crime fighting. Speaking at the opening of the 22nd session of the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice in Vienna, Austria, UNODC Executive Director Yury Fedotov warned that uninterrupted criminal activities could ultimately affect the achievement of the 2015 anti-poverty targets known as the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), in those countries which needed improvement the most. ""We know that weak and fragile states, especially those damaged by conflict, are more vulnerable to drugs and crime,"" Mr. Fedotov said. ""And we know that crime undermines sustainable development, hinders access to education and employment, and drives away foreign and domestic investors."" He noted that an international consensus was steadily emerging for the rule of law to be integrated into the post-2015 MDG agenda in what would be a crucial move for promoting development. ""We must take advantage of this to ensure that our work in the area of rule of law and justice is properly aligned to sustainable social and economic development."" Returning to the issue of international crime, the UN crime chief stated that UNODC was continuing to confront new and emerging crimes as well as existing ones that were taking on new, lucrative forms throughout the world. In particular, Mr. Fedotov pointed to the growth of fraudulent medicines, terrorism, human trafficking and the illegal trade in wildlife, small arms and cultural artefacts. ""Interrupting the flow of crime proceeds is a necessity,"" he continued. ""We cannot allow the criminals and their networks to prosper from their crimes or to fund other illicit activities."" Mr. Fedotov underscored the UNODC's ongoing efforts in combating global criminal networks through its seven regional programmes, announcing the creation of three new programmes to be launched in the Caribbean, South Asia and Southern Africa. ""Regional programmes offer a delivery system for crime prevention and criminal justice activities to be mainstreamed into areas such as development, security, and governance,"" he said.

X Share this article Share to X BEIJING , April 8, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- As Asia grows aware of it's soft power, the virtue of honesty and integrity are caught in a crisis. Master Hsing Yun , the founder of the Buddha's Light International Association was invited, with Mr. Liu Changle , Chairman of Phoenix TV, to discuss the strength of honesty and integrity at the 2013 Boao Forum for Asia (BFA) on April 6 . They tried to answer questions such as why we have broken off so desperately with the ideals and idealism we once firmly adhered to, what has been going wrong and where the way out is. Continue Reading During the 2013 Boao Forum for Asia, Master Hsing Yun was invited to discuss the strength of honesty and integrity on April 6. (PRNewsFoto/Secretariat of the Boao Forum) (PRNewsFoto/SECRETARIAT OF THE BOAO FORUM) (Photo: http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20130408/CN90025 ) Master Hsing Yun believes that the loss of honesty and integrity will harm the whole society. ""The Chinese character for honesty ( cheng ) is composed of words and success. It indicates that if you want success then you should keep and fulfill your promises. In other words, make your words credible"", he said.  Most ancient Chinese philosophers, including Confucius, Mencius and Laozi, believe in the virtue of honesty and integrity, so do Buddhists. Master Hsing Yun thinks everyone should try to be an upright person first before he or she asks others to. He emphasized that one's honesty and integrity measure the worth of a person. A recent survey shows that people now find it hard to trust others. In recent years, tension and conflicts between police and citizens, doctors and patients, enterprises and customers are not rare. The rise of a country is based on more than economic growth. Its cultural charm, i.e., soft power, sometimes speaks louder. The loss of honesty and integrity was categorized by Mr. Liu into three groups: relationship between government and citizens, enterprises and customers, and people in society. For example, public trust for civil servants, teachers, or doctors, who have been highly respected in the past, is declining. Corruption damages public trust. Liu also discussed the problematic integrity of mass media itself and emphasized the urgency of the problem. As a non-government, non-profit international organization, BFA brings the voice of Asia to the world, attracting thousands of leaders in government, business and academia in Asia and other continents to share visions on the most pressing issues in this dynamic region and the world at large.

Switzerland says there is growing unease about a rising number of foreigners. The EU has criticized the decision. https://p.dw.com/p/18Mx1 Image: Fotolia Advertisement The Swiss government announced on Wednesday that immigration limits to all European Union countries would be extended beyond existing restriction to newly joined members. Switzerland, which is not a member of the EU but which is a member of the ""borderless"" visa-free Schengen zone, said the measures would apply starting from next month. The government announced that for a one-year period from May, a maximum of 2,180 long-term residence permits would be issued to migrants from recently-joined EU member states, with 53,700 issued to members from established EU members. However, EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton said the move ran counter to an agreement between Brussels and Bern. ""These measures disregard the great benefits that the free movement of persons brings to the citizens of both Switzerland and the EU,"" Ashton said. However, Swiss Justice Minister Simonetta Sommaruga said the country was merely extending a ""safeguard clause"" that it already applied to long-term permits for the citizens of eight eastern European countries. ""The government does not view the invocation of the safeguard clause as an unfriendly act towards the EU,"" Sommaruga told reporters. ""It's a fact that there is unease among the population, and it's necessary to take this unease seriously,"" she added. More entering than leaving A Swiss government statement cited figures showing that the number of foreigners arriving in the country to work had been up to 80,000 more than the number leaving. The step comes after initiatives were launched by the far-right Swiss People's Party and right-wing ecological group Ecopop calling for referenda on the subject of immigration. The news came on the same day that Switzerland was reported to have welcomed a new celebrity citizen, albeit from outside the EU. A municipal official was reported by the DPA news agency to have confirmed reports in the Swiss tabloid Blick that US rock star Tina Turner had received a Swiss passport, having lived in the country for most of the past two decades. rc/kms (AP, dpa, AFP) Send us your feedback Your feedback Advertisement Skip next section Explore more Explore more Swiss limit eastern, central European immigration Swiss limit eastern, central European immigration A Swiss decision to re-impose quotas on workers from eastern European EU states angered politicians in Brussels who called the move discriminatory.

"USA TODAY Skip to main content Home U.S. Sports Entertainment Life Money Tech Travel Opinion For Subscribers Weather Investigations Crosswords Humankind Newsletters Media For You Contributor Content 18 months after release: Amanda Knox's to-do list Susan Page | USA TODAY On her last night in an Italian prison, Amanda Knox wrote a wish list in her journal of what she'd like to do if the appeals court considering her case set her free. The next day, the judges reversed her conviction, and within 24 hours she was on a flight home to Seattle from Rome. Now, a year and a half later, she describes in an interview with USA TODAY what she's done on that to-do list: Move into an apartment with Madison. ""Check, yes,"" Knox says. She and her best friend, Madison Paxton, shared an apartment in downtown Seattle for 10 months. Now Madison has moved to an apartment one floor down. Graduate from U.W. ""I still have a year to go,"" she says. ""I was in classes this past winter. I'm taking the spring off because of book-ness"" — that is, the publication of her memoir — ""but then I'm going back in the summer. At the end of next spring, about a year from now, I'm hoping to check that one off."" She is majoring in creative writing at the University of Washington. Visit Laura in Ecuador. Laura, an American woman serving time on drug smuggling charges, became Knox's roommate, confidante and friend in prison. ""I'm hoping to do that very soon, once everything with the book is done."" Knox's mother, Edda Mellas, hasn't been enthusiastic about the idea of her daughter taking another trip abroad. ""My mom is like, 'You're not leaving!' "" Write. Her book, Waiting to be Heard , is being published by HarperCollins today. Become fluent in German so I can talk to Oma. ""I'm not fluent, but I'm working on it."" She practiced her German in prison by writing letters to her grandmother, Elizabeth Huff, an Austrian émigré who lives in Seattle. ""I have a whole huge collection of German grammar books."" Go camping and hiking with my family. ""We actually went rafting, which was incredible because I'm afraid of water. But, you know, so, get over that! ... It feels good to touch water and to touch grass and to see goats climbing on the rocks. And those were things that I really missed and were something that I always shared with my family. So being able to go back to that meant a lot."" Pay my family back for everything they've spent on getting me out of here. ""I've been able to help them a little bit with paying back some loans and that has felt really good,"" Knox says. HarperCollins paid a reported $4 million for her book. ""The last bit that I was able to give, the last chunk, relieved a lot of their worries."" One day get married and start a family of my own. ""I want to do that,"" she says. ""I haven't done it yet.

""My son, he goes to a Christian university, and we just found out last night...he's struggling with homosexuality. Can you help him?"" That's a verbatim quote from a worried mother who contacted my counseling practice last fall. I get a handful of calls like this every year. I recall them vividly because, among other reasons, the parents are usually so sincere. It's something that always sticks with me as one who gave his own parents much grief. Advertisement I didn't end up seeing this woman's son. We talked a bit more, and I could hear in her voice she wanted something I couldn't provide. ""But your practice is Christian, right?"" I told her what I tell everyone. ""I am a Christian,"" I said, and rattled off some orthodoxy, ""but if your son comes in and tells me he is gay, I wouldn't have any reason to disbelieve him. It wouldn't be my approach to try to change that."" She went on to investigate whether I think homosexuality is a sin and whether I'd be incorporating Scripture into my approach with her son. I answered her questions faithfully, and then made a referral to a practice across town more suited to her desires. I felt sad when I hung up, because I'm certain I'd have liked her son from the way she described him. So far as I can tell, there's only one reason many Christians think counseling sessions with homosexuals must include efforts to reorient. It really has precious little to do with one's conception of homosexuality. In principle, it's because they have a flawed understanding of the precise nature of counseling, and certainly, counseling undertaken by and from Christians. To many, counseling involves meeting with a soothsayer who looks into his psychological and spiritual crystal ball, then tells you what you're doing wrong and what you're supposed to do to fix it. It's a remarkably non-Christian idea, actually. Advertisement The word most commonly translated counsel in the Old Testament is the Hebrew term Ya`ats, usually denoting consulting, devising, or guiding, generally by those appointed to advise kings on strategic war and political undertakings. My favorite use of Ya`ats is in the Psalms, when David says he will ""bless the Lord, who has given [him] counsel."" An unknown Psalmist even wrote that the words of God are themselves counselors. Christians understand Isaiah to have been prophetically referring to Jesus Christ as ""Wonderful Counselor,"" and he later distinguishes God as such when he infers through a series of rhetorical questions that God himself needs no counselors. In the New Testament, the Greek word 'parakletos' was used most significantly by John the disciple, and is defined similarly to its Old Testament counterpart -- assistance or support. Christ is referred to in this sense when He speaks to God the Father in our defense, and the Holy Spirit is referred to as ""another paraclete."" The point of all this? Counselors work with and within the sentience of human beings, not against or in spite of it. Counseling is not about telling people what to do, even when you think you know, even when you think God told you so -- and apparently, even when you are God. Neither is it about being valueless or opinionless, as if such a counselor could exist. This kind of counselor is pure fiction, a fantasy Hollywood creation with swanky leather furniture who says things like, ""I don't know what I think. The real question is, what do you think?""...as if mentally ill people get well by simply being asked to introspect. Fundamentalists of all religious, political, and cultural sorts help propagate this false idea. In their world, the only position a counselor could possibly hold is their own, or none at all. And since no one holds their positions as perfectly as they, the only safe route is a valueless counselor with clipped wings, who watches silently while clients suffer rather than hazarding feedback at the risk of offense. Advertisement No, counselors have opinions. But they aren't license to shove people around, to callously disregard other points of view, or to tell clients what to do. This is not the Scriptural model, which promotes supporting and guiding where you've been invited, not demeaning and demanding where you've not. And since my context differs from Scripture, even the support and guidance I provide is done with caution and tentativeness. Truth be told, I don't know what people ought to do, so it makes much more sense if I act as though that's the case. I can't tell you how many times I've been sitting across from clients and thought, ""Hmm...You should really seek the help of a professional!"" But there's the rub. Many Christians, and perhaps most people, don't know your name, your age, your story, or anything else about you, but genuinely believe they know what you ought do. They have made themselves soothsayers at best, and gods at worst. ""They have exchanged the truth about God for a lie, and worshiped and served created things rather than the Creator."" And as inevitably happens when we become gods, we completely ignore how God actually functions. The counselor who embraces vulnerability and mutuality is able to enter with clients into a fellowship of brokenness from which healing is borne. The counselor who embraces power and knowing enjoys no fellowship at all.

Late Dutch-Catholic priest and Harvard Professor, Henri Nouwen, believed the way of Jesus is ""...to enter into solidarity with those who suffer. Those who can sit in silence with their fellowman, not knowing what to say but knowing that they should be there, can bring new life in a dying heart. Those who are not afraid to hold a hand in gratitude, to shed tears in grief and to let a sigh of distress arise straight from the heart can break through paralyzing boundaries..."" This is what counseling homosexuals, and indeed, all people, must look like if I am to follow Jesus. I embrace my weakness, my unknowing, my lack of clarity, my poor insight into their experience, my insensitivity to their plight, my sinfulness, and ultimately, them. I refuse to put on the cloak of presumption and certainty, and reject the position of authority that is God's alone, which is not something to be grasped or used for the advancement of some ideology. You are right if you believe this view of counseling requires a certifiably weak view of God, because I am portraying God the Counselor as suffering participant and guide, rather than dictator. Advertisement In Western Christian culture, we are made to believe that God's love is scarce and fragile, and you must be strong and hostile to receive and hold onto it. In my counseling office, both for client and counselor, God's love is abundant and resilient, but you must be weak and foolish enough to embrace it.

My Account Sign In Sign Out Home :: Military :: Library :: News :: 2013 :: April :: Military Menu Introduction Systems Facilities Agencies Industry Operations Countries Hot Documents News Reports Policy Budget Congress Links WMD Intelligence Homeland Security Space Military Israel's 5th Dolphin submarine launched in north Germany Iran Press TV Tue Apr 30, 2013 2:43AM GMT Israel has launched its fifth Dolphin-class submarine, which was constructed to undertake long-range classified missions and carry missiles armed with nuclear warheads, at a shipyard in northern Germany. The director general of Israel’s Ministry of Military Affairs, Major General Udi Shani, the commander of the Israeli navy, Rear Admiral Ram Rothberg, and a number of other Israeli and German officials attended the inauguration of the submarine at the Howaldtswerke-Deutsche Werft (HDW) shipyard in Kiel Port on Monday. The submarine, named the INS Rahav, will cost $500 million and will arrive in Israel in one year upon the completion and installation of its relevant systems. It is considered one of the most advanced submarines in the world and will be Israel’s most expensive piece of military equipment. Israel’s first three Dolphin-class submarines are believed to be some of the most sophisticated diesel-electric submarines in the world. The fourth submarine, the INS Tanin, the first of the new generation Dolphin II submarines, was delivered in May 2012. Germany donated the first two submarines after the first Persian Gulf War and agreed to cover a third of the cost of the third one. In March 2012, Israel signed a contract for a sixth Dolphin-class submarine, to be delivered in a few years. Israeli officials consider the submarines to be a critical aspect of the Israeli nuclear deterrent. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the submarines “a strong and strategic tool” for the Israeli navy.

Matters YOU US TNS Newspost Do no harm February 04, 2019 In Pakistan, despite government efforts, people who identify as transgender face a discriminatory behavior. A recent post on social media highlights the cruelty that was practiced in a healthcare institution. In Kohat, a transgender person died after being denied medical treatment. This outraged the people who were with the patient. But even their protest couldn’t make the hospital management provide treatment to the injured patient who later died. While the government has taken various steps to protect the rights of the transgender community, such incidents show that the community is still not being treated respectfully. The recent case of the death of the transgender person after not being given proper attention is yet another example of such marginalisation.

She wondered why the SEBI and the RBI had not initiated action against the erring companies. “Anything related to chit funds and money laundering comes within the purview of the Centre; had our government not been in power one might not have known of such activities in our State. Thanks that the matter has come to light.” Censuring the Left Front governments, Ms. Banerjee said, “Had there been effective legislation after the Sanchayita scam [more than three decades ago] so many people would not have been duped.” Now, the government would pass a Bill in the Assembly with provisions to confiscate the company’s properties and those of others engaged in illegal collective investment schemes. Accompanied by some of her Ministers, Ms. Banerjee presented the draft of the new Bill to Governor M.K. Narayanan at Raj Bhavan, 45 minutes after the previous West Bengal Protection of Interest of Depositors in Financial Establishment Bill, 2009, was returned. The new Bill was verbally “approved” by Mr. Narayanan and was expected to receive his formal assent on May 5 on his return to the city. On receiving his consent, the Bill would be forwarded to the Centre immediately so that action against errant companies could be taken without further delay, Ms. Banerjee said. It is to be placed in the Assembly during a two-day special session beginning April 29. Speaker Biman Bandopadhyay told journalists earlier in the day, after an all-party meeting, that the law was expected to have retrospective effect so that those responsible for fraudulent activities in the past would not be spared. However, the CPI(M) asked why the 2009 Bill was not being accepted. “We intend to raise this issue during discussions,” said senior MLA Anisur Rahaman.

Speed 1.00 0.25 0.50 0.75 1.00 1.25 1.50 1.75 2.00 New WellPoint CEO Joe Swedish threw cold-water Wednesday on widespread speculation that he will lead the company through a new wave of hospital and doctor acquisitions. Swedish, who took the helm of the Indianapolis-based health insurer a month ago, also talked about leading WellPoint for the next decade, a period in which he expects the entire health care industry to shift to serve customers more like retailers. Swedish, 61, had spent his entire career managing hospitals, including the past eight years as CEO of Michigan-based Trinity Health Corp., a Catholic hospital system. But in spite of many questions about the prospect, he’s not looking to get back in that business. “To be clear, I do not currently see vertical integration as a likely path for WellPoint,” Swedish said during an investor conference call Wednesday morning. “The models are so divergent that it just does not seem to be the best use of capital.” Analysts, investors, local health care providers and even WellPoint’s own employees have been asking about the possibility of WellPoint acquiring hospitals and doctors since Swedish was named to replace former WellPoint CEO Angela Braly in mid-February. When Swedish’s appointment was announced, Wedbush Securities analyst Sarah James said his background as a hospital CEO fit right in with the industry trend of health insurers acquiring more health care providers. “We view vertical integration as one of the key themes for the industry over the next 5-10 years,” James wrote in a Feb. 13 note to investors. “There is a range of savings numbers emerging from insurers that used integrated care models,” and, she added, “we see vertical integration as a way to reduce medical expense.” WellPoint already spent $800 million in 2011 to acquire California-based CareMore, which operates clinics and a health plan for seniors in the federal Medicare program. WellPoint has replicated CareMore to operate more than 25 clinics. Swedish emphasized that WellPoint is moving to work more closely with health care providers than the confrontational stand that it and most health insurers have taken in the past. But he spoke about new kinds of contracts, rather than acquisitions. “[We] will certainly engage with leading providers that are similarly addressing cost efficiency challenges and are willing to align with our products and networks,” Swedish said on Wednesday. Swedish has enjoyed a favorable start to his tenure, as WellPoint reported better-than-expected financial results for the quarter ended March 31. The Indianapolis-based health insurer earned $885.2 million in the first three months of the year, or $2.89 per share. Profit was 3.4 percent higher than in the same quarter a year ago. Excluding investment losses and other extraordinary charges, the company would have earned $2.94 per share, a nearly 26-percent increase over the same quarter last year. On that basis, analysts were expecting profit of $2.38 per share, according to a survey by Thomson Reuters. The higher earnings prompted WellPoint to raise its full-year profit forecast to $7.75 per share, up from its previous prediction of $7.60 per share. Wall Street analysts have been forecasting $7.78 per share, even before WellPoint’s better-than-expected first-quarter results. WellPoint’s revenue in the quarter was $17.7 billion, below analysts’ predictions of $18 billion, but up 15 percent from a year ago. The company lost 321,000 insurance plan members during the quarter, with the losses concentrated in its senior plans, local group employers, individuals and Medicaid plans. Its total enrollment in health plans stands at 35.8 million. Investors cheered the financial results, bidding up WellPoint's stock price as much as 7 percent in morning trading, to a recent $73.09. Swedish said he’s spending his first 90 to 120 days on the job working to understand WellPoint’s business, including the issues that were preventing it from achieving its full potential under Braly, who resigned amid investor anger in August. “I recognize that performance over the last five years was inconsistent,” Swedish said in a reference to Braly’s five years leading the company. “I know the issues that created the volatility, but I want to better understand some of the dynamics that contributed to the deviation and expected performance.” Swedish also said he’s working to understand whether WellPoint is positioned well for 2014, when new health insurance exchanges created by President Obama’s 2010 health reform law start up. That could disrupt the part of WellPoint’s business from which it derives a large portion of its profits . In the long term, Swedish said, the exchanges, where customers will buy insurance largely on their own, as well as continued efforts to expose consumers to price and quality information about health care providers, will push health care toward a retail environment. Right now, the financing of health care operates in a largely wholesale environment, where health insurers, governments and employers do most of the buying of health care, using a language of codes and billing practices that are nearly indecipherable to average consumers. That transition, Swedish said, will put enormous pressure on health care costs. “As the industry evolves to more of a retail model that is consumer-centric, affordability and access will be critical to the value proposition and every market,” Swedish said. “Key to that will be an intense focus on [overhead] efficiency in direct care costs, including provider reimbursement models. Both are critical to support product design advances toward the goal of improved affordability and access for broader population.” Please enable JavaScript to view this content.

Residents in the northern Lebanese town of Arsal, near the Syrian border, said last week Syrian missiles were fired on targets on the Lebanese side of the border. Advertisement Lebanon's national security has come under threat from the civil war in Syria. March marked the seventh anniversary of the Cedar Revolution in Lebanon, which broke Syria's grip on Lebanese affairs. Suleiman said a report on the incident indicated there were no military targets hit by Syrian forces. ""It was established that the shelling did not target military goals,"" he was quoted by The Daily Star newspaper in Lebanon as saying. ""Moreover, there are no reasons or justifications for (the bombardment)."" A Lebanese report on the incident said a Syrian attack helicopter fired two missiles on suspected smuggling routes. The Syrian government had warned Lebanon it would take defensive action if anti-regime activity was carried out in the border regions. A report published Friday by Human Rights Watch accused Syrian forces of conducting airstrikes against civilians, violating the laws of war and committing war crimes. At least 70,000 people have died as a result of civil war, now in its third way.

"Chinese Fishing Ship Sinks After Catching Fire In Antarctic Ocean  | Nature World News Home Animals Biology Environment Health & Medicine Tech Travel Space Natureworldnews.com Let's Connect Trending Hurricane Milton farmers climate change storm surge tropical storm Chinese Fishing Ship Sinks After Catching Fire In Antarctic Ocean By James A. Foley Apr 23, 2013 05:53 PM EDT Facebook Twitter Linkedin Comment Mail A Chinese factory fishing ship that caught fire and had to be evacuated last week has now sank into the Antarctic Ocean, according to news reports. Officials say there is no risk of fuel spilling into the ocean. According to The Australian news agency, the Chilean navy said an official representing the ship's owner confirmed that the vessel went down on Sunday afternoon near Bransfield Strait at the Antarctic peninsula. After the ship was evacuated last week, environmental groups expressed concern that the ship, and the fuel in its hull, was a potential ecological hazard in the pristine Antarctic waters. The Chilean government promised to monitor the ship and stood by to contain any spilt fuel. According to Captain Juan Villegas, maritime governor for Chile's portion of Antarctica, the fire onboard the ship appears to have burned up any fuel at risk of spilling. ""An environmental disaster is ruled out because of the fire on board,"" Villegas told The Associated Press. ""Experts say that if there was any fuel on board it has burned out by now."" The 97 crew members working on the vessel Kai Xin abandoned ship last week after the fire was reported and a Norwegian ship came to assist with the rescue. The 104-meter Chinese ship was built in 1990, according to the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources. © 2024 NatureWorldNews.com All rights reserved.

Rescue officials say emergency personnel continue to dig through the rubble at the Rana Plaza shopping center in the Dhaka suburb of Savar, to find people who remain trapped in the debris. One firefighter told Reuters there were some 2,000 people on the upper floors of the building when it fell Wednesday. Buildings in and around Dhaka often do not comply with construction regulations. Dozens of people died when a garment factory collapsed in the same area, eight years ago. In November, a fire at a garment factory killed more than 100 workers, raising an outcry about safety in the nation's garment industry. Bangladesh has the second-largest garment industry in the world, providing cheap clothes for major Western brands and retailers which benefit from the South Asian nation's abundant low-cost labor.

Rosaviatsia said that the crew of an A320 plane belonging to [Russian charter airline] NordWind Airlines “spotted signs of combat activities which, they believed, could pose a threat to the safety of the plane.” The plane with 159 passengers onboard was flying early on Monday from Egypt's resort city of Sharm el-Sheikh to the city of Kazan, in Russia's republic of Tatarstan, where it landed safely later in the day. “Taking into account recommendations by the International Civil Aviation Organization [ICAO]…Rosaviatsia deems it necessary to recommend that the Russian airlines suspend the flights of passenger planes, including those in transit flights, over the territory of countries where combat actions are taking place,” the agency said in a statement. The Russian Foreign Ministry has vowed to take urgent steps to investigate and clarify the report, while the Syrian authorities have denied so far any knowledge of “suspicious” activities that might indicate a targeted attack on a Russian plane.

The ""FairSearch"" initiative of 17 companies - which includes Microsoft, Nokia, and Oracle -claims Google is acting unfairly by giving away its Android operating system to mobile device companies on the condition that the U.S. online giant's own software applications like YouTube and Google Maps are installed and prominently displayed. ""Google is using its Android mobile operating system as a Trojan horse to deceive partners, monopolize the mobile marketplace, and control consumer data,"" said Thomas Vinje, the group's Brussels-based lawyer. Android operating systems have the largest share of the smartphone market worldwide, followed by Apple's iOS platform with systems from Blackberry, Microsoft and others far behind. ""Google's predatory distribution of Android at below-cost makes it difficult for other providers of operating systems to recoup investments in competing with Google's dominant mobile platform,"" FairSearch said in a statement. The European Commission, the 27-nation bloc's executive arm and antitrust authority, is not obliged to take any action other than reply to the group's complaint. Google Inc. did not address the complaint's charges in detail. ""We continue to work cooperatively with the European Commission,"" said Google spokesman Al Verney. The U.S. company is already under investigation by Brussels for practices related to its dominance of online search and advertising markets. That complaint, launched in 2010, alleges Google unfairly favors its own services in its Internet search results, which enjoy a near-monopoly in Europe. Google has proposed a list of remedies to address the Commission's concerns to achieve a settlement. The Commission is currently examining the proposed changes. In China, Google has already come under official scrutiny because of Android's dominance of the mobile smartphone market there. Several European data privacy regulators have also launched an investigation into Google's practices, alleging the company is creating a data goldmine at the expense of unwitting users. Last year, the company merged 60 separate privacy policies from around the world into one universal procedure. The European authorities complain that the new policy doesn't allow users to figure out which information is kept, how it is combined by Google services or how long the company retains it. The policy allows Google to combine data collected from one person as they use Google's services, from Gmail to YouTube, giving it a powerful tool for targeting users with advertising based on their interests and search history. Advertising is the main way the company makes its money.

Monks Lobsang Dawa, 20, and Konchog Woeser, 23, set fire to themselves early Wednesday evening at the Tagtsang Lhamo Kirti monastery in Ruo’ergai county, or Dzoege in Tibetan, in Sichuan province, London-based Free Tibet and US-based Radio Free Asia said. The monks’ bodies were taken inside the monastery, where other monks held prayer ceremonies for them, the broadcaster quoted Indian-based exiled Tibetan monks with contacts in Sichuan as saying. In a separate protest on Tuesday afternoon, a young Tibetan woman died after self-immolating in Sichuan’s Rangtang, or Dzamthang, county, the broadcaster said. Tsering Woeser, a well-known Tibetan writer based in Beijing, reported on Twitter that the woman was a 23-year-old herder. “All the Tibetans who resort to self-immolation do so because they feel they have no other way to make China and the world listen to their country’s call for freedom,” Free Tibet director Eleanor Byrne-Rosengren said of the latest protests.

On Sunday, about 200 armed men surrounded the Foreign Ministry (pictured). https://p.dw.com/p/18PUz Image: Getty Images Advertisement A standoff is under way after militiamen sealed off the roads to the Justice Ministry with their trucks on Tuesday. Armed men had stormed the Interior Ministry on Monday, as well as a state-owned television station, while a major Sunday protest focused on the Foreign Ministry. ""Several armed men in vehicles equipped with anti-aircraft guns surrounded the Ministry of Justice,"" spokesman Walid Ben Rabha told the news agency AFP. ""They asked the minister and staff present to leave their offices and close the ministry."" According to representatives, the militias are rising up against former regime officials holding government posts. However, many in Libya believe they are trying to pressure the government of Prime Minister Ali Zidan out of trying to disband militias. Nearly two years after Moammar Gadhafi's overthrow, Libya is struggling to build a unified army and police force. ""We call on all those exercising their right to freedom of assembly and expression in Libya to do so peacefully,"" said Patrick Ventrell, a spokesman for the US State Department. He added that Libyans who have grievances ""should peacefully utilize the democratic process to do so and not attempt to intimidate political officials. Libyans fought their revolution to establish a democratic system in which the voices of the Libyan people could be heard through peaceful means. Violence only threatens to undermine the legacy of the revolution."" Libyan rebels won the 2011 civil war against Gadhafi's military with air support from NATO. mkg/msh (AFP, dpa, AP) Send us your feedback Your feedback Advertisement Skip next section Related topics Related topics Law and Justice Hindu nationalism About DW Who we are Press DW Global Media Forum DW offers Learn German DW Akademie Service Newsletters Reception FAQ Contact Topics from A to Z Headlines B2B Sales & Distribution Travel Advertising German News Service Follow us on © 2024 Deutsche Welle Privacy Policy Legal notice Digital accessibility Data privacy settings",About 200 armed men surrounded the Foreign Ministry on Sunday.

RPA urges political forces running to the Elders' Council of Yerevan to conduct a civilized campaign. To recap, activists of the Armenian National Congress (ANC) Party were attacked in the Yerevan Administrative District of Ajapnyak, Monday.  The activists were campaigning in favor of the ANC at the upcoming elections to the Elders' Council of Yerevan when some twenty men attacked and beat them, an ANC representative Gevorg Gevorgyan says.  The attackers declared it was the 'territory of the Republicans,' he says. As a result, a 27-year-old Alik Sargsyan was hospitalized with injures. Fortunately, his life is not in danger. Gevorg Gevrogyan says that the ANC activists informed the police of the incident, but the attackers have not been exposed yet. In this light, the ANC Party has disseminated a statement saying that the authorities create obstacles to the election campaign of the opposition party. ""The authorities fell in panic after the latest congress of the ANC and the wide response to it.  The confusion of the authorities shows that the elections to the Elder's Council may catalyze serious political changes in the country if the opposition gains victory,"" the ANC states.

The third airstrike reportedly hit close to the border town of Rafah [AFP] Published On 28 Apr 2013 28 Apr 2013 Israel’s air force has carried out three strikes in the Gaza Strip, witnesses have said. Two airstrikes hit the southern town of Khan Yunis, early on Sunday. The third was near the southern town of Rafah, near the Egyptian border, Palestinian witnesses said. There were conflicting reports concerning the targets and no reported casualties. An Israeli army spokesperson confirmed the air force had carried out strikes in the Gaza Strip but told the AFP news agency she could not give further details. The Israeli authorities also closed on Sunday until further notice the Kerem Shalom goods crossing following a rocket attack, the defence ministry said. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told Sunday’s weekly cabinet meeting that Israel would retaliate with great force against any rocket or missile fire. “I want to make it clear that we will respond in a very offensive way against any rockets or missiles. We will take all necessary measures to ensure the security of Israelis… on all fronts,” his office quoted him as saying. Israel had not carried out Gaza airstrikes since early April, when it launched the first strikes since an Egyptian-brokered truce in November ended a deadly eight-day conflict between Tel Aviv and fighters belonging to Hamas, which governs the territory. On April 19, two rockets fired from the Gaza Strip hit southern Israel without causing any casualties or damage.

Mr. Morsi's Islamist allies have introduced legislation that would lower the retirement age for judges from 70 to 60, affecting more than 3,000 judges and prosecution officials. The Islamists say the legislation is needed because the courts are filled with loyalists of the deposed regime of Hosni Mubarak. But the opposition accuses Mr. Morsi's backers of trying to fill the judiciary with their own supporters. In an attempt to resolve the crisis, Mr. Morsi met Sunday with five top judges. After their meeting, a statement from the president's office said Mr. Morsi hold a conference this week to work out a compromise on laws that affect the judiciary. Mr. Morsi has repeatedly clashed with the courts since his election last June.

2013, 11:50 ET Share this article Share to X Share this article Share to X WASHINGTON , April 25, 2013 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- In celebration of National Park Week, the National Park Foundation – the official charity of America's national parks – today received a $500,000 grant from the Disney Worldwide Conservation Fund to help connect kids to nature through America's national parks. Disney's investment will go specifically to the National Park Foundation's "" Ticket to Ride "" program, which helps students explore the outdoors by providing transportation to national parks around the country. (Logo: http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20090630/DC40408LOGO ) ""Providing the means for America's youth to experience all that our national park system has to offer is imperative,"" said Neil Mulholland , president and CEO of the National Park Foundation. ""Disney's support has helped make it possible for us to engage thousands of young people in life changing park experiences, and ultimately inspiring the next generation of park enthusiasts."" Now in its second year and with continued support from the Disney Worldwide Conservation Fund and Disney Friends for Change, ""Ticket to Ride"" provides financial resources for transportation, in-park educational programming, and meals that make national park field trips possible for schools across the country.  The grant from Disney will help more than 60,000 students to experience location-based learning in their local national parks this year. For many students, the Ticket to Ride field trip will be their first visit to a national park.  Recognizing that once in the parks a world of experiential learning opens up, the National Park Foundation and the National Park Service are dedicated to providing this critical access to the parks. Through these field trips, young people discover their natural, cultural and historical heritage, participate in volunteer and service-learning activities, enjoy recreational opportunities and most importantly, begin a lifelong relationship with their national parks In addition to the grant, Disney's Friends for Change – a program that inspires kids and families to make a positive impact on their world by helping people and the planet – developed a public service announcement (PSA) that will air on Disney Channel and Disney Online.  The spot encourages kids and families to explore the outdoors, whether at a local, state, or national park.  Disney Friends for Change also created an online action kit (disney.com/friends) that helps families plan a park visit in four easy steps and provides ideas on park activities ranging from hikes to wildlife exploration. ""The more kids are exposed to the great outdoors, the more they appreciate and understand the beauty and value of our natural resources, from our national parks to our own backyards,"" said Leslie Goodman , senior vice president of Disney Corporate Citizenship. ""Disney is proud to work in collaboration with National Park Foundation to make a park experience possible for tens of thousands of young people. We hope that these outdoor adventures inspire lifelong conservation values.""

Read Today's Paper Torrent Pharma: Trading at a significant discount; a good bet SECTIONS Torrent Pharma: Trading at a significant discount; a good bet By Narendra Nathan , ET Bureau Last Updated: Apr 22, 2013, 10:00:00 AM IST Rate Story Follow us Share Font Size Abc Small Abc Medium Abc Large Save Print Comment Synopsis The pharma major is trading at a significant discount to its peers and presents a good entry point. ET Bureau The Torrent Pharma stock has come under pressure in the recent past due to the ongoing dispute between insulin manufacturers like Torrent Pharma and the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA). The NPPA recently reduced the price of insulin produced by Torrent Pharma by 17% because it feels that the medicine is for mass consumption. Though Torrent Pharma has challenged this decision and the NPPA is in the process of revision, the company is being forced to sell the product at a lower price and this is likely to continue till the final decision. While MNCs have been allowed to charge a higher price for insulin, they are also facing the NPPA heat, and this is affecting the contract manufacturing division of Torrent Pharma. The company’s revenue from contract manufacturing declined 4% in the third quarter mostly because of the lower offtake of insulin by Novo Nordisk. However, the performance of this division is expected to improve due to incremental sales from the couple of new deals it has signed recently. After a weak performance in the past few quarters, the company’s domestic formulation business grew 13% in the third quarter, close to the industry growth. To improve the domestic business further, Torrent Pharma is focusing on the productivity of its field force. Introduction of new drugs (about 12 drugs per quarter) should also help in improving the sales force productivity and result in better margins. Another problem being faced by Torrent Pharma is the less than expected growth from Brazil. This division is struggling due to the slower pace of approval and also because of the government’s decision to include two of its products (Losartan and Metformin, which contribute around 10% of its Brazil revenue) in the reimbursement programme. However, the low base and new product launches should fuel growth in the US, which has shown a 35% year-on-year growth on constant currency in the third quarter. A reasonable valuation makes the company attractive and the recent correction has only made it ripe for picking. As is evident from the accompanying table, Torrent Pharma is trading at a significant discount to its peers. Though the problems from Brazil will continue to weigh on the counter, the valuation gap is expected to come down in the future due to higher growth from the US and India. This should also result in steady margin expansion in the coming years. Selection methodology: We pick the stock that has shown the maximum increase in consensus analyst rating during the past month. Consensus rating is arrived at by averaging all analyst recommendations after attributing weightages to each of them (5 for strong buy, 4 for buy, 3 for hold, 2 for sell and 1 for strong sell) and any improvement in the rating indicates that the analysts are becoming more bullish on the stock. To ensure that we pick only companies with a decent analyst coverage, this search is restricted to stocks that have been covered by at least 10 analysts.

Matters YOU US TNS National Punjab introduces austerity measures August 02, 2018 ISLAMABAD: The Punjab interim government has taken another drastic step to lessen government expenses to end extravaganza now in vogue in government departments and offices after it curtailed the special allowances of the governor’s and chief minister’s houses staff. The measure aimed at reducing non development expenditures that are costing the kitty highly, and the government is faced with seeking huge grants in supplementary to the budgetary provisions. In a circular, the Punjab Finance Department asked all the administrative secretaries and all other heads of departments, divisional officers and high court, said “the provincial government has decided to observe utmost austerity in usage of public money through prudent financial management, observance of financial discipline, judicious reduction of the expenditures without compromising the essential and core organisational functions/activities. Expenditures shall be required to be realigned with the organisational goals to make them target-based and cost-efficient. Wastage of resource and leakage of funds needs to be curbed strictly. The measures include complete ban on re-appropriation/supplementary grant, depositing of government funds in any commercial bank instead of spending within the year. Travelling abroad for medical treatment on government expenses will not be allowed to any government functionary. All discretionary funds furnishing of houses and purchase of vehicles except ambulances or vehicles used for educational purposes.

It has condemned the Central Government’s decision to allot only 925 MW power to the State, despite several appeals. “We have received a letter from C.D.Chacko, under secretary, Power, stating that the entire power generated from Kudankulam plant cannot be allotted to our State. To sort out the power crisis (in the state), the Centre has to give preference and to Tamil Nadu in the first two years,” V.S.Manimaran, president, MADITSSIA, said in a press release in Madurai. He said the association members had staged an agitation in this regard near Parliament House in New Delhi on December 11 last year. “We went to the Prime Minister’s Office too and handed over a representation.” In an official communication to the association on April 16, the Department of Atomic Energy had conveyed through Mr.Chacko that the power to be generated from the Kudankulam plant had been allocated by the Ministry of Power among beneficiary States back in 2004 itself. “As per the existing guidelines for allocation of power from Central Sector Generating Stations, the 2,000 MW (2X1,000 MW) power to be generated has been allocated,” he had said in the letter. While Tamil Nadu will get 925 MW of power, Karnataka has been allotted 442 MW, Kerala 266 MW and Puducherry will be given 67 MW. The remaining 300 MW of power is in unallocated category. “After discussions between the Union Power Minister and the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, the ministry agreed to consider providing additional 100 MW to Tamil Nadu from the Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant,” Mr.Chacko said in his communication to MADITSSIA.

"USA TODAY Skip to main content Home U.S. Sports Entertainment Life Money Tech Travel Opinion For Subscribers Weather Investigations Crosswords Humankind Newsletters Media For You Contributor Content Court says states can restrict access to public records Richard Wolf, USA TODAY |  USATODAY WASHINGTON -- States may have little reason to restrict public records access to their own residents, but the practice is not unconstitutional, the Supreme Court ruled Monday. The unanimous decision, allowing Virginia to favor its residents under its Freedom of Information Act, goes against media organizations and professional data miners that had sided with the law's out-of-state challengers. During oral arguments in February, several justices had questioned whether the state's law served any purpose, since non-residents can hire residents to get information. In his ruling, Justice Samuel Alito noted much of the data is available on the Internet. Still, Alito said, the state law ""did not abridge any constitutionally protected privilege or immunity"" because access to public records is not a ""fundamental"" privilege, such as employment. While the Constitution's privileges and immunities clause ""forbids a state from intentionally giving its own citizens a competitive advantage in business or employment, the clause does not require that a state tailor its every action to avoid any incidental effect on out-of-state tradesmen,"" Alito said. The decision had been expected, since most of the justices' questions during oral argument focused on the rights of states to favor their own residents. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg noted states can restrict who votes in their state. Justice Antonin Scalia said perhaps the state ""didn't want outlanders mucking around in Virginia government. Why isn't that reasonable?"" The federal government and all 50 states have laws giving people the right to inspect some government records through the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). The laws are used by journalists, researchers and a growing industry that mines data from government records, which are used to do everything from selling real estate to setting credit scores. At least seven states restrict that right to residents of the state. Their laws are protected by the Supreme Court ruling, but it doesn't necessarily extend to other state laws that treat residents differently from non-residents. The challenge to Virginia's law began when Mark McBurney, a Rhode Island resident who used to live in Virginia, asked state officials for copies of records he hoped would shed light on why they hadn't enforced an order requiring his wife to pay child support. Officials rejected his request because he had moved to Rhode Island. McBurney and another man, Roger Hurlbert of California, sued, arguing that the residents-only limit violated the Constitution's privileges and immunities clause and amounted to an improper restriction on interstate commerce. Gannett Co., USA TODAY's parent company, joined an amicus brief asking the court to invalidate Virginia's residents-only provision.

Two lawsuits, filed in McLennan County district court, have accused Adair Grain, Inc, the parent company of West Fertilizer Co, of negligence, according to copies of the filings provided by the court on Tuesday. Advertisement The company ""was negligent in the operation of its facility, creating an unreasonably dangerous condition, which led to the fire and explosion,"" said a lawsuit filed on Friday by insurance companies on behalf of individuals, two churches, and businesses including a Chevrolet car dealer and a bakery. Investigators have not said what caused the April 17 fire and explosion in West, Texas, near Waco. Daniel Keeney, a spokesman for Adair Grain Inc and for its owner, Donald Adair, declined on Tuesday to comment on the lawsuits. ""Our focus is on the fact-finding and on assisting the investigating agencies in any way we can,"" Keeney said. The other lawsuit was filed by Andrea Jones Gutierrez, a single, working mother who lived in an apartment complex next to the plant. She is seeking $500,000 to $1 million in relief, according to the lawsuit filed on Monday. Jones Gutierrez and her child lost their apartment and all their possessions, according to the lawsuit. It said she also suffered physical and emotional injuries without offering details. Advertisement The lawsuit filed by the group of individuals and businesses does not list a demand for damages because many of the plaintiffs do not yet know what they have lost, said Dallas lawyer Paul Grinke, the lead attorney in that lawsuit. Some of them only have the clothes they were wearing when they were forced to abandon their homes, he said. The insurance companies involved in that lawsuit are Acadia Insurance Company, continental Western Insurance Company, Union Standard Lloyds, Union Standard Insurance Company. ""This is just to get the legal process initiated,"" he said. ""Most of my clients and the folks I'm representing have not been able to get back to their property to see what's left of it. I have gotten pretty close, and it is true devastation."" Support Free Journalism Consider supporting HuffPost starting at $2 to help us provide free, quality journalism that puts people first.

David Lev Apr 10, 2013, 1:13 AM (GMT+3) Obama budget Avigdor Lieberman Israel news photo: Flash 90 Following a trend among U.S. politicians, MK Avigdor Lieberman has suggested that Knesset members donate 10% of their salaries back to the government. The salary cut would be in effect until the end of 2014. According to Lieberman, he discussed the idea with MKs in his Yisrael Beytenu party after a meeting Tuesday with government officials on the state budget. Writing on his Facebook page, Lieberman said that the state was in grave danger of overspending in the coming fiscal year, and that it was the responsibility of MKs to help out. In recent weeks, a slew of U.S. politicians, from President Obama on down, have volunteered to donate a portion of their salary back to the government. Obama himself is returning 5% of his salary, in solidarity with government workers whose jobs are set to be cut because of the budget cuts caused by the sequestration process. “We hope that the Prime Minister, Knesset chairman, and Finance Minister will support this proposal,” Lieberman wrote on his Facebook page. “Along with the budget savings, we will also present a positive role model for the state,” he added. Lieberman added that he and his party backed Finance Minister Yair Lapid. “There is no doubt that it is easier to stand on the side and give advice than to take responsibility,” he wrote. “We do not act in this manner. We have thus decided that Yisrael Beytenu will give full support to Finance Minister Lapid and will vote for any budget he brings to the government.” Found a mistake?

Al-Naimi told an audience in Washington Tuesday that he welcomes an increase in U.S. oil and gas production as good for the U.S. economy and world oil supplies. But he said the idea of energy independence is naive and simplistic, because he said global energy markets are interconnected. Since the 1973 Middle East oil embargo, many Americans, including President Barack Obama and his predecessors, have said the United States must stop depending on foreign oil. They say energy independence is crucial for U.S. national security. Saudi Arabia is the world's largest oil producer and exporter. Its oil reserves are the second largest in the world.

"Human Rights Watch says Russia taking harsh turn - UPI.com Top News U.S. News World News Featured Odd News Entertainment Movies Music TV Science Health Sports NFL MLB NBA Soccer Voices Photos News US News World News Entertainment Sports Archive Almanac Advertisement Special Reports April 24, 2013 / 10:51 AM Putin's Russia draconian, rights group says MOSCOW, April 24 (UPI) -- Laws enacted since Vladimir Putin returned to the presidency last year are ruining Russia's reputation, Human Rights Watch said. Human Rights Watch published a 78-page report Wednesday highlighting the ""crackdown on civil society"" that followed Putin's election to a third non-consecutive term in May. Advertisement Government critics were denied a permit to protest last month. Putin's re-election last year was marked by widespread protests and his government has since jailed several opponents. The rights community expressed recent concern over laws passed in Russia that expand the definition of treason. A crackdown on the role of non-governmental organizations, passed in July, was equally problematic for Human Rights Watch. Director of European and Central Asia programs at Human Rights Watch Hugh Williamson said Putin's administration has harassed opponents and the rights community. It's labeled critics as ""clandestine enemies."" ""The government crackdown is hurting Russian society and harming Russia's international standing,"" Williamson said in a statement. The Moscow offices of Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International and Transparency International were raided by Russian authorities last month. Russian authorities described the raids as routine. A government spokesman didn't reply to questions Wednesday from state-owned news agency RIA Novosti, which reported the offices of independent pollster Levada Center were raided on allegations of using foreign funds.

Communication is key as the guards coordinate their movements. Industry bigwigs are suggesting that preconceived notions about the sector also affect them as people consider security companies wicked, for example because guards have to buy their own uniforms. People also believe security companies are swimming in revenue at the expense of the guards. Commander George Overton, president of the Jamaica Society for Industrial Security (JSIS), argued that as independent contractors, the individuals are offering themselves to the company to provide services. ""You basically dictate when you are available for duties,"" he said. ""In that arrangement, the security officer is basically treating himself as a self-employed individual."" Tax relief Headlines Delivered to Your Inbox Sign up for The Gleaner’s morning and evening newsletters. Overton said based on the tax structure, as agreed by the Government, private security workers get tax relief. ""So they tell you, 'Oh we have to pay for our uniform' but what they don't tell you is that they get tax relief for that expense."" Overton said there are 28 companies within the JSIS representing 80 per cent of the industry, and many are struggling. He said the issue was with what are called ratios, particularly the element of the guard's direct wage against the billing. ""So if I bill, for argument's sake, $300 an hour for a guard, I am paying something like $260 an hour directly to the guard,"" Overton explained. The other $40 goes to company's overheads. ""I remember when I joined the industry in 1989, we were pretty much operating on a 50-50 basis,"" he recalled. ""Today, the best of the companies in the market are operating at 70-30 ratio."" Pessoa agreed with those figures and opined that customers were having trouble making payments, even the biggest consumer, the Government. ""The customer is demanding a longer term in terms of credit to pay,"" he said. ""But we can't delay because we have commitments to the guards. We have to pay them every fortnight."" daviot.kelly@gleanerjm.com View the discussion thread.

The SIT counsel R.S. Jamuar asserted at a local magistrate’s court that the way the petition had been drafted “suggested that it is nothing but a piece of wastepaper.” He called it fiction and alleged that a few persons had drafted it and the complainant Zakia had no knowledge about its contents. Mr. Jamuar claimed that the complainant had presented no case or evidence but extracted the material submitted before Justice (retired) G.T. Nanavati-Akshay Mehta Commission. The “complainant has extracted most of the material submitted, examined and cross-examined by a commission of inquiry, Justice Nanavati Commission, which is still functioning and is yet to submit its final report,” counsel stated. Mr. Jamuar further argued that, “no courts, either civil or criminal, is binding to the report of any panel set up under the Commission of Inquiry Act and here the complainant has drafted her whole complaint based on the material from the Commission.” He pointed out that the petition tried to add new facts and evidence which had never been investigated and had been picked up from the depositions made before the Nanavati Commission. Ms. Zakia is widow of Congress MP Ehsan Jafri who was killed in the Gulberg Society massacre in Ahmedabad during the 2002 riots.

Sarah Groves, 25, was found on Saturday in a pool of blood inside her room on a house boat hotel on the Dal Lake in Srinagar, Kashmir. She had been stabbed 45 times. Dutch tourist Richard de Wit, 43, who had a room adjacent to Miss Groves in the hotel, has been arrested on suspicion of her murder. Describing the 5.45am call from India that brought news of her savage killing, her father, Victor Groves, from Guernsey, said today: 'It was still dark, I didn't know where the phone was, and I stumbled around to pick it up. 'The voice on the other end was a very rough Indian accent and he said: ""Mr Groves, your daughter is dead, she has been murdered"". 'I said to him: ""You can't just say this to me, it may not be true."" I didn't know if it was genuine. I rather suspected it wasn't, but he knew a lot about the situation. 'I immediately called Guernsey Police ... They confirmed two hours later or so that it was genuine. 'That's where we are now and, sadly, where we will always be.' Mr Groves spoke at a press conference near his Channel Island home as a British diplomat arrived in Srinigar to escort his daughter's body to the Indian capital, Delhi. Miss Groves' Kashmiri boyfriend, Saeed Ahmed Shoda, 26, also spoke today of the moment he came face to face with her alleged killer in the police station where both faced questioning over the crime.

'The first time I said ""I do not want to talk to you"",' he said in an interview with ITV Daybreak. 'The second time I said ""Why did you do this?"" and he said ""Yes, I killed her. Yes I did this"" - it made me want to kill him.' In a separate interview with AFP, Mr Shoda said the suspected murderer told him: 'There is no reason [why I killed her]. I just killed her.' Tragic: Indian police carry the coffin of Sarah Groves into an ambulance to take her body to the airport, where she will be accompanied by a British diplomat on the way to the Indian capital Delhi Crime scene: Journalists and policemen stand outside the houseboat where Miss Groves was found dead on Saturday, on the Dal Lake in Srinagar, India Indian police say De Wit, who was arrested hours after Miss Groves killing as he attempted to flee the area in a taxi, has confessed to carrying out the frenzied knife attack, telling them: 'The Devil took over my body.' Deputy police inspector general Afadul Mutjaba told AFP that they had learned from Dutch police that their suspect has a history of psychiatric problems. The policeman also said it is believed that De Wit was under the influence of a drug at the time, possibly cannabis or heroin.

She suffers from MS It's all at risk now: Indian police say De Wit, pictured right with one of his children and left in another old photo, has confessed to murdering Miss Groves and told them he was under the influence of drugs at the time Miss Groves' original plans had never included going to Kashmir, said Mr Groves, whose business has an office in India. He revealed that the family had begged her not to travel to the area. After exploring Goa she was meant to travel to Sri Lanka where she would meet up with Sarah Griffith, founder of the Bridge 2 Sri Lanka charity. 'She was happy there but we were keen that she didn't stay there too long,' Mr Groves told the press conference. 'We weren't happy when she changed her plans to go there, but we were ultimately reassured and she seemed to settle in ... with a good interdenominational family-type environment. 'It is nothing against the guy himself but sadly she met somebody and instead of going to Sri Lanka she went north instead.' Miss Groves had been staying on a houseboat belonging to the family of her boyfriend Saeed Shoda In an effort to tempt Miss Groves away from Kashmir, Mr Groves had booked a trip to Nepal where he and his wife intended to meet up with her at the base camp of Mount Everest on April 19. Miss Groves had previously climbed Mount Kilimanjaro and raised more than £3,000 for Childreach International. 'We didn't want to particularly separate them [Sarah and Saeed] long term - but Sarah wanted to see so many places and she got caught up in something which meant she only saw two places,' said Mr Groves. The beautiful student received defensive injuries to her arms and hands in the horrific attack Speaking from India in a UK television interview, Mr Shoda today said he hopes De Wit, Miss Groves' alleged killer, will be 'in hell'. 'I want him to get really big punishment, he made her really suffer and I want him to be in hell as well,' he told ITV Daybreak. 'She didn't know him at all, so why he did this?' Anger: Miss Groves Kashmiri boyfriend Saeed Ahmed Shoda told ITV Daybreak of the moment he came face to face with her suspected killer as both faced questioning over her death at the local police station VIDEO Sarah's boyfriend on Daybreak on meeting suspected killer Describing how her death had affected him, he added: 'I couldn't really walk and stand up, I really did cry a lot. I think now my life is really like shut down. 'I spoke with her parents and I told them I am very sorry for this, I couldn't really take care of her. 'The whole world will see her face and see how innocent she was and how kind she was.' A British diplomat today travelled to Srinigar to escort Miss Groves' body on a flight to the Indian capital Delhi this afternoon. Indian police personnel carried her simple coffin from the mortuary at the Shere-i-Kashmir Institute of Medical Science into a battered old ambulance for transport to the airport. 'Your daughter is dead. She has been murdered': Mr Groves also revealed how he had learned of Sarah's death in a phone call Nazir Ahmad, Station House Officer at Ram Munshi Bagh police station, said: ‘We have handed over the dead body of the British woman to an official from the UK Embassy. The body will be be flown to New Delhi this afternoon.’ The Groves, who last spoke to their daughter two days before her death, have not travelled to Kashmir and do not intend to after Mr Shoda carried out the identification process. However, they were unsure when her body would be bought back home. The latest comments from Miss Groves' family and her boyfriend come after the results of a post-mortem examination yesterday showed that Miss Groves had 'bravely' tried to fight off her killer. Cuts to her arms and wrists suggested she had fought for her life, before her killer fatally plunged the knife into her chest, puncturing a lung, and her neck, severing the carotid artery that takes blood to the brain. Tragedy: Sarah Groves, 24, pictured getting a make-over, tried to 'bravely' fight off her killer during a knife attack in which she was stabbed 45 times Saeed Shoda described Miss Groves as 'perfect' and the pair were planning a trekking holiday together Police said the 24-year-old was found inside the boat and had defensive wounds to her wrists and arms The post-mortem results come after films emerged on YouTube that appear to be the holiday videos of her Dutch alleged killer Richard de Wit. The videos, uploaded by a user of the same name, show Baclaran Market in Manila. They were uploaded in February, just weeks before Sarah was killed. Dr Farida Noor, head of forensics at Srinagar's General Medical College, said yesterday two of the wounds were fatal. She added that the former public school girl had defensive wounds to her hands and arms proving that she had tried to resist the attack, according to The Telegraph . Dr Noor said: 'Two of the wounds were fatal, one on her neck and the other pierced her lung. 'The cause of death was haemorrhage, but all the rest of the injuries were defence wounds. She tried to save herself... I think she would have fought bravely.' Saeed Shoda (left) said he has spoken to Dutch national Richard de Wit, who was arrested about 45 miles from the scene of the suspected murder Before setting out to India, Sarah wrote: 'Quit your job, buy a ticket, get a tan, fall in love, never return' The post-mortem results came as Miss Groves' Guernsey-based family prepare to return her body home and friends paid tribute to the 'free spirit'. She was staying on a houseboat owned by the family of her Indian boyfriend, who said she was 'like a daughter' to them. Before Miss Groves set off for India in July last year she posted a message on Facebook which said: 'Quit your job, buy a ticket, get a tan, fall in love, never return.' She wrote a blog called The Bright Side of Life, on which she posted uplifting messages such as: ‘When you seek beauty in all people and all things you will not only find it, you will become it.’ Pictures posted on Facebook show her with African children. Friend Fabiana Harrington, who accompanied her to Kilimanjaro, said that in Tanzania she had fallen in love with the saying kuwa huru, meaning ‘be free’. ‘This is really how she was – a free and loving soul, a fearless, brave, inspirational and generous free spirit,’ she said. A police officer holding Sarah's hiking boots. She was a keen traveller and had raised money for a children's charity by climbing Mount Kilimanjaro An officer bagging evidence. The boyfriend's family heard screaming and raised the alarm Many friends and fellow pupils of £30,240-a-year St Mary’s School in Ascot, Berkshire took to Facebook to pay tribute to Miss Groves, the daughter of wealthy businessman from Guernsey. One friend, Annemarie Flemming, wrote on Facebook: ‘Your beauty, passion, smile and energy will always stay in my heart.’ Another, Claire Spindlow, said: ‘Sarah, your amazing outlook on life and beautiful personality was infectious to all those around you.’ Hafiza Shoda, mother of Miss Groves's boyfriend Saeed Ahmed Shoda, said she was 'devastated' at the backpacker's killing. 'She was a shy, lovely girl and called me mother in Kashmiri,' Mrs Shoda said as she expressed regret at hiring a room on the houseboat to the 43-year-old alleged killer. A police officer with a pair of Sarah's shoes at the front entrance to her room on the houseboat 'Had we known the man had such evil intentions, we would have never let him stay,' she added. 'I'm devastated.' Mr Shoda had gone to see friends at the time Miss Groves was killed in the early hours of Saturday morning on the houseboat near Kashmir's capital Srinagar. 'I wish I hadn't gone,' he said. 'I torture myself with those regrets now. She may still be alive if I was here or if she had come with me. I don't know how I can come out of this trauma. 'It was a very short time we were together but I will never forget her. She has left a mark on my life. She had a great wonderful soul.' Yesterday he said he had confronted De Wit, a 7ft cannabis user, and begged for answers. Mr Shoda said de Wit’s response was brazen and ‘not normal’, adding: ‘I saw him at the police station and I asked him, why did you kill her? ‘The killer is not right in his head. He is not of this world. He doesn’t seem okay when you speak to him. He will not divulge anything about his crime, he has confessed to the crime but will not give any details. 'I want him hanged. He had no reason to kill her. She didn’t do anything wrong. I just don’t understand.’ Indian police said de Wit had confessed to the murder, which was allegedly carried out with a 12in knife. The Deputy Inspector General of Kashmir Police, Ahfadul Mujtaba, said: ‘We put him in front of the magistrates today and we now have him in our custody for a further ten days. ‘He has confessed to killing the girl but at this time he is not giving any further detail.’ De Wit had arrived at the lake two days earlier and was staying in a separate cabin on the same boat as Miss Groves, a former bank worker. Saeed's brother Irfan said the police did not send forensic officers until a day after the crime Sarah Groves' backpack is taken away for forensic tests by police Indian policemen carry the coffin containing the body of Miss Groves Investigation: The police station where the body of Sarah Groves is being kept She was found at around 3am by Mr Shoda’s brother Irfan and father Abdul. Irfan said she had desperately tried to phone for help during  the attack and was found lying  on her bed, clutching her  phone and with cuts on her fingers. He said: ‘The Dutchman’s room was open. Sarah’s door was open, broken. ‘I used my torch and saw Sarah in a pool of blood on her bed. She was motionless and one of  her hands was in her mouth.’ Officers said they had not ruled out sexual assault because the victim’s clothes had been torn. After the attack, de Wit fled in a stolen rowing boat, which capsized. He swam to shore and was picked up by police, carrying his passport and with no shoes, 50 miles away in Qazigund after flagging down a taxi.

Hafiza tried to persuade her to stay the night with her, but she declined, saying she wanted to speak to her father and read a book. Her parents, Victor, 70, and Kate, 66, are understood to be preparing to fly to India. Her brother Tom, 31, yesterday launched an online campaign to get justice for his sister, writing: ‘She lit up so many people’s lives.’ The attack will be another blow to the Indian tourist industry after a 25 per cent drop in foreign visitors since a spate of sexual assaults on women over the past few months.

In March a 39-year-old Swiss tourist was gang-raped while camping with her husband in woodland in central India. A few days later in the northern city of Agra, a 31-year-old British tourist was forced to jump from a second floor balcony when she feared a sexual assault by the owner of her hotel, who was trying to get into her room at 4am. Shocked friends have left messages for Miss Groves on social networking sites. James Blower, a businessman in Guernsey, tweeted: 'Can't believe Sarah Groves is dead. Such a little ray of sunshine and not a bad bone in her body. Taken far too young.' The Foreign Office has confirmed that a British woman has been killed in Srinagar and that it is providing consular assistance to her family. Share or comment on this article:

        4:01 PM EDT, Tue April 23, 2013 Link Copied! Video Ad Feedback Explosion rocks French Embassy in Libya 01:49 - Source: CNN Story highlights Libyan deputy prime minister: The French ambassador said he will not leave Tripoli Two French security guards and a 13-year-old girl are injured The car bomb destroys the front wall of the embassy and shatters windows nearby The attack comes 7 months after four Americans were killed at a consulate in Benghazi Tripoli, Libya CNN — A car bomb exploded just outside the French Embassy in Tripoli early Tuesday morning, injuring two French security guards and a Libyan girl, officials said. The blast was so powerful it blew the front wall off the embassy. Homes can cars adjacent to the embassy sustained heavy damage, and the windows of nearby buildings in this upscale, largely residential neighborhood were also blown out. During a visit to the area, Deputy Prime Minister Awad Barasi said a 13-year-old girl in a nearby house was injured in the attack and will be taken to Tunisia for treatment. Barasi, who condemned the attack, said he had spoken with the French ambassador to Libya, who assured him he will not leave Tripoli. The French Foreign Ministry issued a statement condemning the attack. “In conjunction with the Libyan authorities, our government departments will make every effort to ensure that all light be shed on the circumstances of this heinous act and its perpetrators quickly identified,” the foreign ministry said. Barasi told CNN it was too early to “jump into conclusions” about who might have carried out the attack. A criminal investigation is under way to try to determine who was behind the attack and why. At least four French investigators were at the scene with what appeared to be forensic equipment gathering evidence. They seemed to be leading the investigation and working with Libyan officials from the Criminal Investigations Division. Libya’s Interior Minister Ashour Shuail, who visited the site along with the country’s justice minister, said one of the two French security guards had undergone a surgery in Tripoli and was now in stable condition. He would not say who the government believes is behind the attack and said the investigation would reveal that. The minister said security will be increased around diplomatic missions in the capital. Responding to questions about lax security, Shuail said no country is immune to this sort of security breach, not even the United States, referencing last week’s Boston Marathon bombings. Residents in the area complained about lax security at  the French Embassy. While there has been no claim of responsibility, Libyans at the scene blamed extremist groups. “We have to admit they exist here in Libya,” said Mustafa, who was in a nearby house. “They are small groups, no one likes them or supports them.” Western intelligence officials have said militants linked to al Qaeda had training camps in Libya. After the French military intervention in Mali in January, there were fears militants could strike French interests in the region, including Libya, which has been struggling to impose security across the country since the 2011 revolution that ousted Moammar Gadhafi. At a news conference, Shuail said he could not link the attack to Mali. He said Libya has to first deal with the widespread weapons in the country. Rami El Obeidi, former intelligence chief during the Libyan revolution, blamed the attack on al Qaeda-linked groups. “Without a doubt, extremist Jihadi movements aligned to al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (are responsible).  Same alliance that’s responsible for the attacks on the British, American, and Italian missions in Benghazi, their proven involvement in the Algeria attack, and the logistical support that was given to AQIM elements in Mali,” El Obeidi said. The French Embassy bombing follows a series of attacks last year that targeted foreign diplomatic missions and the International Committee of the Red Cross in the eastern city of Benghazi. The attacks are believed to be the work of Islamist extremist groups with ties to al Qaeda. Last September, U.S. Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens and three other Americans were killed in a militant attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi. According to El Obeidi, Tuesday’s early morning blast was a message to the French government about the capabilities of these groups, rather than a blast that aimed to kill. Residents and embassy staff said the bomb detonated an hour before the area is busy with dozens of Libyans who line up daily to apply for visas. “This was a political message because the attack was not designed to kill anyone, especially not Libyans, as this would have caused fractures within the extremist movements currently operating inside Libya” El Obeidi added.

"S. Korea, US on Alert for Possible N. Korea Missile Launch Subscribe Now ! My Account Sign In Sign Out Home :: WMD :: Library :: News :: North Korea :: 2013 :: April :: Military WMD Menu Introduction Systems Facilities Agencies Operations Countries Hot Documents News Reports Policy Budget Congress Links Intelligence Homeland Security Space Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) S. Korea, US on Alert for Possible N. Korea Missile Launch by Steve Herman April 10, 2013 There is growing concern in Northeast Asia that North Korea is about to conduct another provocative missile launch, possibly firing a number of rockets simultaneously. South Korean and U.S. forces in the country have gone to a higher reconnaissance posture, just one notch below that of wartime. The status change from Watch Condition (Watchcon) 3 to 2 comes amid indications of the presence of missiles on mobile launchers in North Korea. Watchcon 2 denotes indications of a 'vital threat.' Domestic South Korean media say the change went into effect Wednesday. ​​Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se, appearing before a legislative committee in Seoul, characterizes rival North Korea as ready to launch a medium-range Musudan ballistic missile. Yun says intelligence obtained by South Korea and the United States has ascertained that ""the possibility of a missile launch by North Korea is very high"" and could occur ""at any time from now."" Yun describes the Musudan, which Pyongyang has never tested, as having a range of about 3,500 kilometers and ""it is up to North Korea how far it would fly."" South Korea's semi-official news agency, Yonhap, says that additional mobile launchers - possibly for other types of missiles -- have been spotted in South Hamgyong province on the east coast. A top U.S. military officer, Admiral Samuel Locklear, earlier confirmed before the Senate Armed Services Committee in Washington that at least one medium-range ballistic missile had been moved to the east coast of North Korea. Locklear, who heads the Pacific Command, says the U.S. military is able to intercept a ballistic missile fired by North Korea that would threaten U.S. bases or any of America's allies in the Pacific, including South Korea and Japan. The committee's chairman, Senator Carl Levin, asked Locklear for details about a new joint counter-provocation plan with South Korea. It outlines types of responses to limited military action by North Korea. The admiral says he is hesitant to provide specifics during open testimony. 'I am supportive of the plan and I think it's a good one. And we will continue to revise it as time goes on,' he said. Senator Levin asked 'But are you satisfied that we would be ready if there were such a limited military action from North Korea?' 'I am satisfied that we're ready today, yes,' Locklear responded. Mood in Seoul Despite the increasing tension on the peninsula, the mood remains calm in the South Korean capital, Seoul, and the metropolitan area where more than 20 million people reside - nearly half the country's population. The U.S. State Department says it is not advising its citizens to consider leaving nor is there any reason to avoid visiting the country. North Korea on Tuesday suggested that foreigners in the South should depart because all-out war could break out at any time. South Korea's presidential office says Pyongyang's attempt to create fear among foreigners will fail and it is merely psychological warfare. The unusual advisory to expatriates in the South is the latest in a series of statements made by the North that have prompted international concern and condemnation. Ceasefire renounced After recent ballistic missile and nuclear tests, Pyongyang renounced the 1953 ceasefire agreement, vowed to conduct a preemptive nuclear strike on U.S. territory and declared a state of war between the North and South. Despite all of this, military and intelligence sources say there are no indications North Korea has mobilized its army, which is one of the world's largest. Meanwhile, Pyongyang is keeping 50,000 workers away from the only joint venture between the two Koreas, a factory complex at Kaesong. Seoul Wednesday blamed the Reconnaissance General Bureau of the North Korean Army for a cyber attack last month that crippled 32,000 computers and servers at some South Korean broadcasters and banks. South Korea's finance ministry is vowing to swiftly take stabilizing measures, should inter-Korean tension trigger strong volatility in stock or currency trading.

He was sentenced to an additional nearly 60 years in prison for involvement in several other rock attacks. Wael hurled large stones at the Palmers’ car, hitting Asher Palmer in the face as he drove to pick up his wife, Pua, from work at a Jerusalem hospital. The injury led to a car crash in which Asher and his son Yonatan were both killed. Yonatan had been two days shy of his first birthday. Police initially labeled the fatal car crash an accident. Only when their announcement sparked protests among local residents, officials and the media did they reconsider, ultimately finding that the deaths were the result of a terrorist attack. The verdict finding Wael al-Arja guilty of murder earlier in the month was hailed as a landmark ruling by experts, who said it shows that judges are beginning to treat rock attacks as potentially deadly assault.

It’s a nice way of getting feedback when you want it, especially if it would have been helpful before sharing your thoughts with the world. One thing that the company left out, though, was that since you can invite any friend to collaborate on your posts via a link, once they actually post a note, they’ll be able to use Medium, too. This was confirmed in an email sent out by Ev Williams and company today to its members: Also, here’s something: They will then have access to write on Medium, as well. So, for the first time, you can invite people to Medium. (They just have to help you first.) This is interesting for two reasons: it’s a clear incentive for your friends to participate in the writing and refining of your posts and it’s a perfect onboarding experience for new users to add notes before they ever write a post of their own. Killing two birds with one stone is smart, and it’s a way for the team to get more people using the service in a controlled way. Since there hasn’t been an answer to “how can I join Medium?” until now, other than being invited by the team or being a Twitter employee, this now serves that purpose. Start writing.

Some information may no longer be current. Commissioners Marie Wilson, Justice Murray Sinclair and Chief Wilton Littlechild of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission release their interim report during a news conference in Vancouver, B.C., on Friday February 24, 2012. DARRYL DYCK/The Canadian Press Share A lack of co-operation on the part of the government is jeopardizing its promise to record and preserve the sad history of abuse that took place behind the walls of Canada's aboriginal residential schools, the Auditor-General has found. In a report released Tuesday, Auditor-General Michael Ferguson says his office has found that the Aboriginal Affairs department and the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, the body established to record the legacy of the church-run schools, have not been able to agree on the most basic of things. Under a settlement agreement signed by the government, the churches and the school survivors in 2006, government departments were to provide the commission with millions of documents related to the schools that were generated over the more than 100 years they were in operation. The aim is to create a historical record of the schools where tens of thousands of former residents say they suffered physical, sexual and emotional abuse. But, while the Aboriginal Affairs department has handed over 3.5 million documents, millions more have yet to be located, digitized and provided to the Commission. The Auditor-General says that is due, at least in part, to the fact that the department and the Commission have been unable to co-operate and agree on a definition of the relevant documents. ""Consequently,"" Mr. Ferguson says in his report, ""they were unable to define the scope of the work to be done so that Canada would meet its obligation and the Commission would fulfill its mandate."" The Commission obtained a court ruling last year that said the government is obligated to find the records, organize them, and hand them over. And the government continues to collect and digitize the documents, says the Auditor-General. While both the government and the Commission bear responsibility for the lack of co-operation, the government had far more resources at its disposal to get problems resolved, said Mr. Ferguson. ""Right from the very beginning,"" he said, ""the two parties really didn't get together, determine what all of the priorities were going to be and how they were going to achieve really what was a very big task."" The major concern now is whether the documents can be gathered in the 15 months remaining in the commission's mandate, said Mr. Ferguson. ""The government and the commission need to step back,"" he said, ""they need to determine what's been achieved to this date, what else needs to be achieved, so that, at the end of the day, the historical record is prepared in a way such that it was originally intended to be."" Justice Murrary Sinclair, who chairs the Commission, said this month that large numbers of records have yet to flow his way. And the Auditor-General says ""it is not possible to assess whether the Commission has obtained or will obtain from Canada all the relevant documents it reasonably requires for the historical record, what remains to be done, how long this will take, or what resources are needed to accomplish this undertaking."" The Commission has determined that, once the documents have been processed, they will be housed at a national research centre at the University of Manitoba. But the Auditor-General found there is no plan to resolve the issues around that transfer, including assurances that the records will comply with federal privacy laws. Bernard Valcourt, the Aboriginal Affairs Minister, said in a
statement that there would be better co-operation going forward. ""We agree with the Auditor General that Canada and the TRC
(Truth and Reconciliation Commission) can work more closely together to ensure the objectives of the Indian
Residential Schools Settlement Agreement are met,"" said Mr. Valcourt. "" And we
are working jointly with the Commission to develop a project plan to fulfill
document disclosure requirements."" Please enable JavaScript to view this content.

"When Gaddafi threatened an oil spill off Malta: an untold story of the Libyan uprising Barely three weeks before the fall of Tripoli, Gaddafi loyalists had threatened to spill 250,000 barrels of gasoline off Malta’s shores from a Libyan tanker caught up in the middle of UN sanctions in June 2011. The ship was the Cartagena, owned by General National Maritime Transport Corporation, a Libyan Government entity controlled by Muammar Gaddafi’s son Hannibal. Former Prime Minister Lawrence Gonzi told The Sunday Times of Malta that although Malta neutrality barred it from taking part in military operations, backroom negotiations in Valletta had helped destabilise the Gaddafi regime.

By JEREMY SHARON FEBRUARY 22, 2013 04:01 311_state conversion panel (photo credit: Marc Israel Sellem) The ITIM religious services and advocacy group has filed a petition with the High Court of Justice demanding that the Interior Ministry recognize Orthodox conversions performed in Israel in non-state Orthodox rabbinical courts. The state conversion authority, which comes under the auspices of the Prime Minister’s Office, is the only body in the country through which an Orthodox convert can gain legal recognition that he or she is Jewish. But many Orthodox conversion candidates have in recent years sought to convert in non-state Orthodox rabbinical courts, largely because of bureaucratic obstacles and inefficiencies in the state run system. ITIM claims that the state has “implemented policies that reject converts out of hand, because of their personal status as tourists, students or spouses of Israelis,” and that this has given rise to increased demand for conversion in non-state Orthodox conversion courts. The organization cited one case in its petition in which a woman from South America, who wishes to remain anonymous, applied to the state conversion authority to convert in 2007, but was only accepted by its Exceptions Committee to begin the conversion process in 2010. She had, however, become frustrated with the system by this time and had already approached the haredi Badatz rabbinical court of Rabbi Nissim Karelitz in Bnei Brak, which accepted her for conversion. She successfully completed her conversion course through Karelitz’s rabbinical court and in March 2011 was registered by a state rabbinical court as Jewish. The woman subsequently married and had a child, but because she is not registered in the Interior Ministry’s population registry as Jewish, her child is not considered Jewish by the state. In a separate case, another woman converted under the auspices of the respected Orthodox scholar Rabbi Adin Steinsaltz and his private rabbinical court. Her conversion was also subsequently accepted by a state rabbinical court, which wrote to the Interior Ministry requesting that her status be changed accordingly, a request that was nevertheless refused. According to ITIM, approximately 10 percent of conversions conducted in the country are carried out in non-state rabbinical courts. Stay updated with the latest news! Subscribe to The Jerusalem Post Newsletter Subscribe Now The Interior Ministry is concerned with the precedent of accepting converts who have not converted through the state system, fearing that the process would lose the requisite oversight and regulation. ITIM’s petition argues that the ministry has exceeded its authority by essentially monopolizing the ability to determine who is a Jew, and demands that it make public its criteria for establishing this. The organization also requested in its suit that the court issue an injunction against the Interior Ministry, to compel it to recognize the conversion of the two women, who are party to its suit, together with two further cases. ITIM director Orthodox Rabbi Seth Farber said that the petition was “a good opportunity to open doors of conversion to more people who are looking for alternative Orthodox conversion routes.” Hot Opinion Israeli and Diaspora Jews form a powerful partnership By JPOST EDITORIAL At his end, Nasrallah was a victim of his own rhetoric By ELIE PODEH Will  escalation in the Mideast upset the US election?

Travel firms have been charging two parents and two youngsters more than they would four adults booking exactly the same package. The levy applied to popular Thomas Cook and Thomson hotels and apartments in Spain, Greece and Turkey. Both firms admitted the pricing discrepancy existed. Penalty Effectively an under-occupancy charge, the policy is similar to the supplements single travellers fall foul of.

Best debit and credit cards to help you... Compare the best travel insurance rates Share this article Share The Daily Mail obtained quotes for a family with two children aged six and ten for a week’s holiday on August 3 and compared them with the same stay for four adults. Thomas Cook’s website charged £2,060 for the family at apartments in Fuerteventura in the Canary Islands – £244 more than for a group of four adults. At a hotel on neighbouring Gran Canaria, the price was £1,932 – a premium of £196 over the adult group. Thomson quoted £2,025 for the family to stay at apartments on Menorca – £173 more than the same trip for four adults. A stay at a holiday village in Bodrum, Turkey, cost £1,611 – a £135 premium. Thomas Cook¿s website charged £2,060 for a family which was £244 more than for a group of four adults A spokesman for the consumer group Which? condemned the policy, saying: ‘It’s completely unfair that holidays should cost more for parents because of under-occupancy charges for children.’ Even though travel companies generally charge for each child – in terms of flights and accommodation – they are often not treated as adults in terms of occupancy targets. As a result, computer systems can trigger a supplement. Hotels use the policy to make up for lower restaurant and bar sales from children. Thomas Cook suggested parents may find it cheaper to describe their youngsters as adults when booking. Thomson apologised for what it claims was a mistake rather than a deliberate policy. ‘We are aware of an issue with the pricing of a very small number of our villa and apartment holidays,’ a spokesman said. Thomson apologised for what it claimed was a mistake rather than deliberate policy ‘On occasion, a villa or apartment will be more expensive if booked including adults and children compared to a purely adult booking. We are working to rectify this issue. ‘Our retail staff will always look for the lowest price available for customers booking in store, and we have rebriefed them to ensure they continue to do this. ‘We recommend that any customer planning to book online before the issue is resolved should check the total cost of their booking against that of all adults and book as adults if necessary.’ After the Daily Mail highlighted the anomaly, Thomson set up a phone line to allow families to claim refunds. Thomas Cook said the policy only ‘very rarely’ led to a family being charged more. A spokesman said: ‘Our agents will always find the best price for our holidays, including on the rare occasions when a minimum adult occupancy level is not met. ‘In such cases, it is common practice for any children travelling to be charged the adult price. Meeting the adult minimum occupancy can be cheaper.’ Thomson customers who have questions about the price they have paid and whether they can claim a refund should contact the company on 0800 0093847.

The Hollywood Reporter says Firth's character recruits his nephew into the service. As well as directing, Vaughn has co-written the screenplay for the film with regular collaborator Jane Goldman. The trio worked together on the well-received 2010 superhero movie Kick-Ass , based onMillar's comic book of the same name. The Secret Service is said to have been written with a film adaptation in mind. The movie version will be Firth's first comic-book movie.

According to reports in the Canadian media, iGate was allegedly using temporary foreign workers to replace the bank’s existing staff. The US-headquartered iGate has been providing IT outsourcing services to RBC for almost eight years. The company had also set up an offshore development centre for the bank out of its facility in this city. A report last week from the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation had said RBC planned to retrench about 50 employees at its investor services division in Toronto, since the work was being done by iGate. Following the report, the Canadian government said it would review a temporary foreign worker programme. The programme allows employers to fill jobs with non-Canadians when qualified citizens or permanent residents are not available because of skill and labour shortages. “The programme was never intended as a means to bring in temporary foreign workers in order to replace already-employed Canadian workers. This is why we have launched a review,"" Human Resources Minister Diane Finley had said. In a statement issued today, iGate said it did not comment on specific client engagements. However, it said, it strictly adhered to all laws of the land and immigration policies in whichever country it operated. “For any engagement requiring foreign workers, in any country, iGate provides the appropriate information to the relevant immigration authorities as may be required for the issuance of temporary work authorisations and hiring is only done after all work authorisations are properly issued under existing law and policy,” it added. A little over half of iGate’s revenue comes from the banking, financial services, insurance and healthcare segments. According to a Reuters report, RBC said on Sunday it had not directly hired temporary foreign workers to take over the work of its current employees. Speaking to the news agency, Zabeen Hirji, chief human resources officer, had said the bank looked at suppliers like iGate to comply with Canadian laws. ""We ask them to undertake that they follow all the rules and regulations for everything, including employment. . .at the end of the day, iGate has to answer that question,"" she was quoted in the report.

How To Increase Your Powers of Observation How to Raise a Group’s IQ Email Print Share Facebook Twitter Tumblr LinkedIn StumbleUpon Reddit Digg Mixx Delicious Google+ Follow @TIMEIdeas Successful leaders often seem to have sharper minds than the rest of us — isn’t that how they got to the top in the first place? While we often assume that people become powerful because of their superior thinking skills, research shows that the relationship flows in the other direction as well: Power changes the way a person thinks, making them better at focusing on relevant information, integrating disparate pieces of knowledge, and identifying hidden patterns than people who are powerless. People who feel powerful also show improved “executive functioning”: They are better able to concentrate, plan, inhibit unhelpful impulses and flexibly adapt to change. ( MORE: The 2013 TIME 100 ) A sense of power “has dramatic effects on thought and behavior,” writes Adam Galinsky, a professor at Columbia Business School, in a 2011 article in the journal Psychological Science . Indeed, “being in a high-power role transforms people psychologically.” The good news is that we don’t have to wait until we’re the boss to reap the mental rewards of powerfulness. Here, three ways to take advantage of the power of power: 1. Find a role in which you feel powerful. All of us can identify some area of life in which we’re able to take the lead — and once we do so, changes in how we think and act will follow. “The social roles people inhabit can change their most basic cognitive processes,” notes Pamela Smith, a social psychologist at Radboud University in the Netherlands. Studies show that when people are assigned to the manager role (in a real organization or in one simulated in the lab), they immediately become more likely to act decisively, to take risks, to persist on tasks they take up, and to think more abstractly and optimistically. This has implications for how we treat others — students, employees, offspring — as well, suggesting that we should reverse the usual practice of waiting until individuals prove themselves worthy of holding power. Empowering people now , by giving them more control and autonomy, will lead them to think and act in ways befitting the role. ( MORE: How to Use the “Pygmalion Effect” ) 2. Remember a time when you felt powerful. Merely recalling a powerful moment from your own past makes you more likely to act powerfully in the present — a difference that is readily apparent to others. In a forthcoming study in the Journal of Experimental Social Psychology , researchers asked participants to recall a time they had or lacked power, then had them write a job application letter or participate in a simulated interview for admission to business school. Independent judges found the people who’d been primed to feel powerful more impressive and persuasive — a finding, the authors note, with “important implications for understanding the psychology of job interviews.” 3. Assume a powerful posture. In his 2011 study , Adam Galinsky and his colleagues asked seated participants to assume either an “expansive” position (one arm on the armrest of their own chair, the other arm on the back of a nearby chair; legs crossed so that the ankle of one leg rested on the thigh of the other leg and stretched beyond the edge of the chair) or a “constricted” position (hands under their thighs, shoulders dropped, legs together). People in the expansive position were more likely to make a bold move in a simulated game of blackjack, and were better at identifying hidden pictures within a series of fragmented images (a measure of abstract thinking). Galinsky highlights the fascinating finding, made in another study , that assuming a powerful posture reduces cortisol (a stress hormone) and elevates testosterone (a hormone associated with self-assertion). “To think and act like a powerful person,” Galinsky concludes, “people do not need to possess role power or recall being in a powerful role” — they just need to arrange their bodies in a powerful way.

Harry Harper suffered a fractured skull and brain damage after he was bitten by the terrier in his table-top carry cot when grandmother Teresa Bell’s back was turned. Mrs Bell had taken the eight-day-old infant downstairs to give his parents, Mikayla Bell, 19, and trainee electrician father Tom Harper, 19, a lie-in. 'Tragic': Week-old baby Harry Harper died of head injuries after he was bitten by his family's 'mild-mannered' Jack Russell, an inquest heard 'Devastated': Baby Harry's mother Mikayla Bell, 19, is seen (left) leaving the inquest yesterday with his father Tom Harper, also 19 In a statement read out to the inquest, she told how she had gone into the kitchen to see her twin 16-year-old daughters off to school and ‘assumed’ seven-year-old terrier PJ had followed her. She then heard Harry cry out and went into the living room to discover the infant covered in blood in the cot with the dog sitting by his feet. RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next 'This is a Catholic country': What father claims consultant... Off-duty police officer unlawfully killed while trying to... Share this article Share Harry was pronounced dead in hospital about 90 minutes after he was attacked in the family home in Ketley, near Telford, Shropshire, last November. The dog, which had never bitten anybody before and was usually placid, was put down. A Jack Russell owned by baby Harry's mother Mikayla Bell at the time of the incident Mrs Bell said she left the sleeping infant in the carry cot ‘on a table against the wall’ as she waved goodbye to her daughters. She discovered the dog in the cot after rushing back into the living room when the baby cried. She said: ‘I heard Harry cry. I went straight into the front room and could see PJ sat inside the carry cot at a space by Harry’s feet. ‘He had something that looked like sick on his head. I pulled the dog out and carried Harry to the kitchen. ‘I remember he was bleeding at the back of his head. There was a lot of blood on his head and in the carry cot. ‘I realised straight away that PJ must have bit Harry. I was in shock at what had happened, thinking it was my fault.’ Harry’s mother, Mikayla, described PJ as ‘mild-mannered’. Miss Bell, a sales assistant and part-time model, said she heard screams and ran downstairs to see ‘Mum holding Harry over the sink’. She added: ‘Mum was repeatedly saying “I’m sorry, I’m sorry” and I heard Mum say “He’s been bitten”. 'Tragic accident': Harry's grandmother Teresa Bell, seen right outside the inquest with daugher Mikayla Bell and husband Gordon, had taken the eight-day-old infant downstairs to give his parents a lie-in Miss Bell, a sales assistant and part-time model, said she heard screams and ran downstairs to see 'Mum holding Harry over the sink' ‘I think at some point Mum said it was PJ that had bitten him.’ Dog attack law changed Miss Bell said she didn’t blame anybody for her son’s death, which she described as a ‘really tragic accident’. Her 40-year-old mother told the coroner, sitting at Wellington Civic Centre, near Telford, that she would ‘always wonder whether I could have done something differently that morning’. Detective Inspector Phil Shakesheff, of West Mercia Police, told the inquest that the family had an ‘unblemished history of caring for and controlling many dogs over a period of many years’. He added: ‘There is no evidence to suggest that the death of Harry is anything other than a tragic incident that can’t be ruled out from occurring in any other dog-owning household where children are present.’ Since 2007, the inquest heard, dogs have killed eight people in Britain, including six children. Recording a verdict of accidental death, Telford’s assistant deputy coroner, Andrew Barkley, urged dog owners to recognise the dangers posed to small children by their pets. After the hearing, the family said in a statement: ‘We remain absolutely devastated by Harry’s death. Although Harry was only with us for eight days, he had brought enormous happiness to us all and his loss is a tragedy that we will all carry with us forever.’ At the time of the tragedy, an animal behaviour expert said the dog may have attacked the infant after becoming jealous at his introduction to what the animal considered to be its territory.

"Alberta, industry face wide gap on carbon tax - The Globe and Mail Skip to main content Search Newsletters Watchlist Home Watchlist For You Canada World Business Investing Personal Finance Opinion Politics Sports Life Arts Drive Real Estate Latest in Subscribe Digital access Digital + home delivery Alberta, industry face wide gap on carbon tax energy Alberta, industry face wide gap on carbon tax Nathan VanderKlippe International correspondent Calgary Published April 9, 2013 This article was published more than 11 years ago. Some information may no longer be current. Marchers pass the White House while protesting against the Keystone XL pipeline: Alberta, trying to sell the pipeline to the U.S. population, is proposing surprisingly high emission standards and harsh penalties.

A demonstrator holds up a sign during a march past the White House to protest against the Keystone XL pipeline in Washington, February 17, 2013. The TransCanada Corp pipeline would link the oil sands of northern Alberta, the world's third largest crude resource, to refineries and ports in Texas. Environmentalists say approval of the pipeline will encourage more development in the oil sands, where extraction is carbon intensive, leading to greater greenhouse gas emissions. REUTERS/Richard Clement (UNITED STATES - Tags: ENVIRONMENT POLITICS CIVIL UNREST ENERGY) RICHARD CLEMENT/Reuters Share Alberta's energy industry is pushing for carbon taxes half as high as what government has proposed, with oil sands companies lobbying for less stringent goals that would leave the province short of meeting its emissions goals. The Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers has suggested the province target a 20-per-cent reduction in per-barrel emissions, and a $20-per-tonne tax on those unable to comply, according to a provincial document. That falls well short of an Alberta proposal for oil sands emissions reductions of 40-per-cent per barrel – up from 12 per cent under current rules – and a $40-per-tonne tax – up from $15 today. The so-called 40-40 proposal, which would come into effect by 2020, was made March 27, at a breakfast meeting with senior oil and gas figures in Calgary, when Alberta described plans for what it called a ""climate change policy renewal."" A slide deck from that meeting seen by the Globe and Mail makes clear that Alberta believes it has little choice but to act as it works to convince others of its commitment to the environment. ""Increases in policy price and target stringency are required to gain credibility,"" the document says. The ""low average price in Alberta is a criticism of the current regulatory system."" The broad gulf between government and industry targets sheds new light on the stakes in discussions with the oil and gas sector. Industry officials have argued that a higher carbon tax could impair their competitiveness, and were stunned by the Alberta proposal. But the province is mired in a fight to improve its image abroad, and in particular in the United States, where Alberta Premier Alison Redford has travelled this week to meet with policymakers. It is the premier's fourth trip south of the border in 18 months, amid a tense bid to convince the U.S. to approve the Keystone XL pipeline project to carry oil sands crude to the Gulf Coast. In the slide deck, the government lists ""social license"" as one of the goals of its greenhouse gas strategy. ""You might as well have written Keystone there,"" said a person familiar with the proposal. Alberta wants to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 50 million tonnes a year from a 2020 ""business as usual"" projection. According to the slide deck, the 40-40 plan would achieve a 61-million-tonne reduction. The Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers proposal would cut 45 million tonnes. Another proposal put forward by the federal government would achieve a 53-million-tonne cut. That would include a 30-per-cent per-barrel emissions cut with a dual carbon price of $30 and $60, where companies would pay the lower price for some emissions and the higher for the remainder. A spokesman for the Alberta ministry of environment and sustainable resource development declined specific comment. An official in the office of federal Environment Minister Peter Kent said there ""remains work to be done"" in sorting out the new policy, and it is ""premature to discuss any solution."" But the competing proposals constitute the yardsticks in the bid to develop energy sector greenhouse gas regulations. And Alberta, which has taken pains to emphasize that it is still deciding what to do, is not wedded to its 40-40 proposal. The slide deck outlines two ""Alberta oil sands options."" The second calls for a 30-per-cent reduction in per-barrel emissions, with a $30 carbon tax. Alberta says it has ""commissioned three financial firms to review this work and provide comment as to its 'reasonableness.'"" The document also suggests the province may not apply the same price to all portions of the energy sector. It mentions an ""opportunity to make adjustments based on economic rational[e]."" In other words, while the oil sands may face the highest targets and carbon price, lower standards may be applied to those that, for example, produce natural gas or refine oil. Alberta says it is not planning to enforce its emissions reductions on smaller emitters, meaning the rules will apply only to those producing 100,000 tonnes a year of carbon. The 40-40 proposal has stirred substantial discussion in Alberta, and in particular among those companies that may face substantially greater costs. Some are skeptical that the province will follow through, saying 40-40 constitutes an initial high number for negotiations. ""We note that the proposal is still in early days and will face many challenges to becoming a reality,"" Andrew Potter, an analyst with CIBC World Markets Inc., wrote on Monday. He noted that, ""in our opinion the proposed levy is designed to appease considerations associated with KXL."" Calculations completed by FirstEnergy Capital Corp. suggest the 40-40 target would cost some oil sands producers roughly 60 cents per barrel after tax. But that may be worth it, FirstEnergy concludes. The firm says if it influences the U.S. decision on Keystone XL, ""then we would view such a trade-off (slightly higher costs vs. much more security regarding heavy oil differentials and thus revenues in the longer term) as a net positive for oilsands producers. But that small number may mask a larger impact: For some projects, it's enough to cut the net present value by fully 15 per cent – although most will face a more modest 2-to 3-per-cent reduction.""

""This present hardship being visited on the people is the work of the present Government,"" he lamented even as he characterised the Government as a wayward, rudderless, ""captainless"" ship in which Jamaicans have been forced to sail. He sought to bring some life to the presentation when he showcased in Parliament two baskets of groceries of contrasting sizes showing the increase in prices between December 2011 and April 2013.

Maayana Miskin Apr 28, 2013, 8:41 AM (GMT+3) imprisoned terrorists Salam Fayyad Prisoner Release PA Terrorists Fayyad, with Arafat on wall Israel news photo: Flash 90 The Palestinian Authority’s outgoing Prime Minister, Salam Fayyad, called Saturday to free all PA resident Arabs imprisoned in Israel. Many are serving time for terror-related offenses, including murder and attempted murder; some were imprisoned for other violent crimes including assault and rape. The release of all PA prisoners is an integral part of obtaining freedom as a nation, Fayyad said. “The Occupation’s prisons hold 4,900 of our prisoners, the prisoners of freedom,” he said. “Of them 106 were arrested before 1994… and 27 served more than 25 years in prison.” “There are also minors under the age of 18 in prison, and sick people in serious condition with heart disease, cancer and kidney failure,” he claimed. Fayyad accused Israel of failing to provide adequate care to sick PA prisoners. He further accused Israel of causing the death of 200 prisoners through medical neglect, torture or murder. The PA has frequently accused Israel of murder in the case of prisoner deaths, including the recent deaths of one man from a sudden heart attack and of another from terminal cancer . Fayyad called to release all Arab terrorists and criminals in Israel’s prisons, saying, “These prisoners have fathers, mothers, spouses, sons, daughters, brothers and sisters. They have beautiful memories of the life they had with their loved ones, and aspirations to take part in building a better future for their families and their people.” “ Marwan [Barghouti] and all the other prisoners have the full right to fulfill their dream as free men in a free homeland,” he concluded. Fayyad is widely viewed as a moderate by the international community. He recently resigned following months of tension with PA Chairman Mahmoud Abbas. Abbas previously has called for Israel to free all terrorist prisoners as a precondition for diplomatic talks. MK Ayelet Shaked recently called the PA out for using the word “prisoners” to refer to terrorists. Found a mistake?

Fracking, which involves blasting underground rock deposits with water and chemicals to release trapped pockets of gas, has been blamed for triggering earthquakes. But a study has concluded ‘it is extremely unlikely that any of us will ever be able to feel an earthquake caused by fracking’. Process: Fracking involves blasting underground rock deposits with water and chemicals to release trapped pockets of gas. The Cuadrilla shale fracking facility in Preston, Lancashire, is pictured After examining hundreds of thousands of gas extraction operations, the scientists found only three instances where resulting shocks could be detected by residents above ground. In contrast, they found other man-made activities, such as mining and waste-disposal, are much more likely to trigger noticeable seismic activity. Lead researcher Professor Richard Davies from Durham University’s Energy Institute, said the risk of fracking resulting in seismic activity that could be felt on the surface is ‘not significant’.

Share this article Share ‘In almost all cases, the seismic events caused by hydraulic fracturing have been undetectable other than by geoscientists. It is also low compared to other man-made triggers,’ he said. ‘By comparison, most fracking-related events release a negligible amount of energy roughly equivalent to or even less than someone jumping off a ladder onto the floor.’ He added: ‘It is extremely unlikely that any of us will ever be able to feel an earthquake caused by fracking.’ Making a point: Demonstrators in London to protest against hydraulic fracturing for shale gas last December A forthcoming report by the British Geological Survey is expected to announce that shale gas deposits are far larger than previously predicted. Industry experts say we could be sitting on enough gas reserves to supply the nation for more than a century. David Cameron wants to see Britain at the heart of the ‘shale gas revolution’, and Chancellor George Osborne has pledged to offer lucrative tax breaks and a simplified regulatory regime to the industry in a bid to promote investment. Prime Minister: David Cameron wants to see Britain at the heart of the 'shale gas revolution' Fracking was temporarily halted at Britain’s only test drill site in 2011, after two small earthquakes woke some residents in Blackpool – they were 2.3 in magnitude. Operations were allowed to resume in December after Energy Secretary Ed Davey announced greater restrictions aimed at limiting the likelihood of tremors. Critics say any shale gas energy boom will scar the countryside and pollute water supplies. Lawrence Carter of Greenpeace said: ‘People’s apprehensions about fracking go well beyond earth tremors. 'Communities are concerned about industrialisation of the English countryside, including noise, increased traffic, falling house prices and environmental damage.’ The Durham team compared data from all earthquakes resulting from human industrial activity since 1929. They found the largest fracking tremor was at Horn River Basin in Canada in 2011 and had a magnitude of 3.8 on the Richter scale. ‘A tremor of 3.8 would feel like a little shudder to most people, like a lorry going down the road or someone jumping off a ladder,’ said Professor Davies. He added: ‘Earthquakes caused by mining can range from a magnitude of 1.6 to 5.6, reservoir-filling from 2.0 to 7.9 and waste disposal from 2.0 to 5.7.’ A Department of Energy and  Climate Change spokesman said: ‘An independent panel of experts commissioned by DECC concluded there was a small risk that fracking could cause relatively minor  seismic activity. 'As a result, the Government has set out that any fracking must be carefully monitored and will be stopped at the first sign of seismic activity.’ Share or comment on this article:

"Islamists to hand out millions of Korans in Germany - The Jerusalem Post Advertisement JP Newsletter Israel News Health & Wellness WORLD NEWS Middle East Business & Innovation Opinion JP Store Login Log Out Archaeology Israel Real Estate Judaism Kabbalah Environment Antisemitism JP Spanish Podcasts JP Shopping Conversation Corner Premium Jerusalem Post World News Islamists to hand out millions of Korans in Germany Media: Security agency says Gulf state financing effort. By BENJAMIN WEINTHAL , JPOST CORRESPONDENT APRIL 16, 2012 05:36 Koran 311 (photo credit: Courtesy) BERLIN – Salafist Muslims launched a concerted campaign in Germany on Saturday and Sunday aimed at distributing 25 million free Korans across German cities. German media reported on Sunday that the Office for the Protection of the Constitution – Germany’s domestic intelligence agency – suspects that either the government of Saudi Arabia or Qatar has financed the German Salafist plan to spread Korans in the Federal Republic. The Palestinian-born preacher Ibrahim Abu Nagie is spearheading the action to inculcate German-speaking pedestrians in cities with a radical form of Islam. The Salafist strand of Islam propagates a strict adherence to the Koran, and the fundamentalist group divides the world into believers and non-believers of Islam. Salafists aim to convert non-believers to their form of radical Islam. In an interview with the magazine Der Spiegel on Sunday, Hans-Werner Wargel, the head of the Lower Saxony state government’s domestic intelligence service, said: “I assume that there are external financiers” for the distribution of Korans. He added that, “We have knowledge that in the past financial streams for Salafist networks in Germany came from the Arabian Peninsula.” According to an article in Die Welt on Saturday, the journalist Florian Fade quoted the Salafist Abu Nagie saying, “If someone says: I want to follow the Bible. Will he enter Paradise? Never, he will forever go to hell!” According to an intelligence agency document obtained by Die Welt, Abu Nagie said “Imagine if all of Germany and Europe were to be Islamized.” The Christian Democratic Union party interior expert Wolfgang Bosbach told the Passauer Neue Presse that though it is legally difficult to ban the action “the local authorities should examine in each case if a permit needs to be issued or if there is a violation of public order and security.” Bosbach added that for the Salafists it is not only promotion for religious convictions “rather the promotion of a radical political ideology that is not compatible with a free democratic system.” German media reported that the city of Ludwigshafen prohibited the distribution of Korans, noting that the Muslim group had not obtained a permit in a timely manner for public space. The Salafists have distributed so far about 300,000 Korans in Germany. In addition to setting up stands in the pedestrian zones of German cities, the Islamists are passing out Korans in Austria and Switzerland. The chief sponsor and organizer of the Koran hand-out action is Cologne-based businessman Ibrahim Abu Nagie and his “True Religion” group. Abu Nagie, a Salafist preacher, speaking in an undated video on the group’s website, urged all German Muslims to hand out copies to their neighbors. Stay updated with the latest news!

The growing presence of Salafism in the Federal Republic has alarmed security officials. Germany’s domestic intelligence agency, Verfassungsschutz, has monitored the activities of “Invitation to Paradise” members, who advocate a Salafist version of Islam that calls for the decapitation of non-believers and the imprisonment of women in burqas.

Arutz Sheva Apr 23, 2013, 11:22 AM (GMT+3) Recep Tayyip Erdogan Armenian Genocide Armenian Massacre Turkey's Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan AFP/File The Knesset will hold a ceremony to mark the memory of the Turkish genocide of Armenians, almost 100 years ago, on Tuesday. MK Reuven Rivlin (Likud) said before the ceremony that he believes that ""as human beings and as Jews, we must not ignore the catastrophe of another nation for any reason, including diplomatic considerations, important as they may be."" ""We will mark the annual memorial day for the massacre of the Armenian people regardless of the relations with today's Turkey, which is an ally."" Turkey is highly displeased with the Knesset's decision to mark the day, as relations between the countries continue to be tense, despite a recent rapprochement brokered by U.S. President Barack Obama. The genocide of the Armenians took place in the course of World War 1, and it is generally estimated that between 1 and 1.5 million Armenians were murdered, making up about one third of the entire Armenian people. The massacre began when about 250 Armenian leaders in Istanbul were shot to death, on orders from the Turkish government. Later on, men, women and children were put to death on a daily basis in various ways, including forced marches that ended in their death from exhaustion, cold and hunger. Women and children were placed on boats and drowned at sea, or crucified. There is also evidence that children were put to death with poison gas in schools that were converted to death camps. Turkey has consistently denied responsibility for the genocide, which is sometimes referred to as the Armenian Holocaust. Various events devoted to the subject, which were supposed to be held at the Knesset, were cancelled in recent years because of Turkish pressure. Found a mistake?

Indian Company Signs U.S. LNG Deal Written By Brian Hicks Posted April 26, 2013 Petronet LNG Ltd. of India recently announced it reached an agreement with Houston-based United LNG LP’s Main Pass Energy Hub, under the terms of which the latter will provide fuel to the Indian company for 20 years. Petronet is India’s largest importer of liquefied natural gas, and this is the company’s first such U.S. deal. United LNG will provide 4 million tons yearly, and prices will be pegged to the Henry Hub rates, with final details being taken care of by the end of 2013. And though this is Petronet’s first U.S. LNG deal, it isn’t India’s first. GAIL India Ltd. had already approached the U.S. for an LNG agreement, while other Indian companies like Reliance Industries Ltd. and Oil and Natural Gas Corp. continue to work to boost LNG production in an increasingly energy-hungry nation. GAIL’s deal with Cheniere Energy (NYSE:LNG) will provide for 3.5 million tons of LNG per year for 20 years, via Cheniere’s Sabine Pass terminal in Louisiana. After news of the deal broke, Petronet shares rose 3 percent in Mumbai, although shares have dropped 12 percent thus far in 2013. Meanwhile in New York, natural gas prices have continued an upward trend, rising 25 percent this year on top of a 12 percent rise in 2012. May contracts are now at $4.175 per million British thermal units. The Main Pass terminal mentioned above is being jointly developed by Freeport McMoRan Energy LLC and United LNG. Expected capacity will be 24 million tons annually, with exports set to begin in 2017. The facility is structured such that it will receive incoming gas via pipeline, which will then be stored in salt caverns and subsequently liquefied on six floating vessels situated some 16 miles off the Louisiana coast. The Main Pass project has already received approval from the U.S. Department of Energy to export LNG to any nation with existing free trade agreements. However, both operators intend to petition for export approval to non-FTA nations, according to Platts . The Natural Gas Conundrum India has now become one of Asia’s biggest oil and gas importers, and more than 75 percent of domestic needs are provided for via imports. Domestic oil and gas production has been on the decline in Asia (although companies are opening up initiatives for shale exploration both on and offshore), hence necessitating vast amounts of imported energy. This is good news for the U.S., which has in short order gone from importing energy to possibly becoming a net energy exporter. In fact, production of natural gas is now so abundant that massive quantities are simply being burned off (flared)—which results in big losses in terms of potential revenue. Moreover, LNG prices over in Asia are usually three to four times more expensive than prices in the U.S. due precisely to this imbalance in supply.

As a result, companies have been pushing hard to get export terminals approved domestically so that the U.S. can profit off all this gas being produced. It’s a two-edged sword, though. As export volumes begin to rise, domestic prices will no longer be so low. And that will likely have a domino effect in terms of international sales dynamics. Meanwhile, demand from Asia is growing explosively. Chinese LNG imports hit 1.83 million metric tons, a figure that marks an increase of 21 percent from 2012. The nation is consuming LNG at the rate of more than 4.5 trillion cubic feet every year. Japan, especially after Fukushima, is catching up fast. Major companies here in the U.S. are betting heavily on LNG exports. We’re talking about oil and gas majors like Exxon (NYSE:XOM), Royal Dutch Shell (NYSE:RDS.A), Cheniere, and the like. But most of them, so far, have focused on potential exports to the Eurozone rather than Asia. At some point, the U.S. administration needs to make its position clear as far as LNG exports are concerned. As mentioned earlier, in the short-run , open LNG exports could be an excellent thing for the domestic economy. We’d see a flurry of terminal development activity, and the whole LNG export web of activity will come alive. However, in the longer run , this will inevitably erase some of the advantages we now enjoy thanks to our natural gas surplus. Domestic prices are going to rise, and that will impact many other sectors. Automobile manufacturers, for one, are increasingly looking to natural gas when it comes to heavy and long-haul vehicles. Many power plants are seeking out natural gas solutions. And increased costs is not what they want.

Email Print Share Facebook Twitter Tumblr LinkedIn StumbleUpon Reddit Digg Mixx Delicious Google+ Follow @TIME The U.S. intelligence community believes “with some degree of varying confidence” that Syrian dictator Bashar Assad’s forces have used chemical weapons, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said Thursday. “Some degree of varying confidence” is a loophole big enough to fly a cruise missile through. “Is he a little bit pregnant or not?” asks retired Marine general Anthony Zinni, who ran U.S. operations in that part of the world from 1997 to 2000. “The trouble with statements like that is you can get drawn in to military operations.” ( MORE: The Thick Red Line: White House Cautious on Chemical Weapons Use in Syria ) The Israelis seem much more confident than the Americans that the Syrian government has recently used small amounts of chemical weapons, including sarin, against rebels in its two-year-old civil war. “The very fact that they have used chemical weapons without any appropriate reaction, is a very worrying development,” General Itai Brun, head of research for Israeli military intelligence, said earlier this week. “It might signal that this is legitimate.” The latest U.S. intelligence assessment, which meshes with similar British and French reckonings, isn’t tantamount to proof, Miguel Rodriguez, the director of the White House office of legislative affairs, told Congress in a letter Thursday. The Administration, he added, is “pressing for a comprehensive United Nations investigation that can credibly evaluate the evidence and establish what took place.” Syrian officials denied Friday that their government has used chemical weapons. In Damascus, a government official told the Associated Press that Syria “did not and will not use chemical weapons even if it had them.” He accused rebel forces of using them in a March attack outside the northern city of Aleppo. Sharif Shehadeh, a Syrian lawmaker, said the Syrian army “can win the war with traditional weapons” and doesn’t need chemical weapons. “We need to know the full story,” Hagel told reporters in the Persian Gulf emirate of Abu Dhabi, “and get it right.” He added that “any use of chemical weapons in Syria would very likely have been originated with the Assad regime.” But despite such nuance, some lawmakers were ready for action. They declared that the Syrian government has now crossed a threshold set by President Obama. “It is clear that red lines have been crossed,” Senator Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., chairman of the intelligence committee. “Action must be taken to prevent larger-scale use.” Last August, Obama warned “that a red line for us is we start seeing a whole bunch of chemical weapons moving around or being utilized. That would change my calculus. That would change my equation.” ( MORE: Syria’s Civil War: The Mystery Behind a Deadly Chemical Attack ) But history would suggest skepticism about such intelligence reports: — The Gulf of Tonkin, Aug. 4, 1964 : The U.S. went to war against North Vietnam on the basis of a false report that the warships USS Maddox and USS Turner Joy came under attack by the North Vietnamese navy. Perhaps a million people, largely civilians, died in the war, including more than 58,000 U.S. troops. — The Al-Shifa pharmaceutical plant, Aug. 20, 1998 : the U.S. destroyed this Sudanese factory with cruise missiles in retaliation for a pair of bombings of U.S. embassies in Africa two weeks earlier. The Clinton Administration said it had evidence of chemical-weapons production at the facility, and that it had ties to Osama bin Laden. Both conclusions, later investigations concluded, were likely erroneous. One person died in the attack; thousands more died for lack of medicines that the factory had been manufacturing before it was bombed. — Operation Desert Fox, Dec. 16-19, 1998 : The U.S. and Britain launched a four-day bombing campaign against assorted targets across Iraq suspected of housing Saddam Hussein’s weapons of mass destruction. Because there was no way of knowing where the easily-hidden infrastructure needed to brew biological and chemical weapons was, U.S. military officials said the bombing’s modest goal was simply to “degrade” his WMD program. But there were apparently no such weapons to be degraded. Up to 2,000 Iraqis died in the attacks. — Operation Iraq Freedom, 2003-2011 : As the second U.S. war with Saddam Hussein made clear, all evidence shows the Iraqi dictator got rid of his stockpiles of WMD after his defeat in the 1991 Gulf War. More than 100,000 Iraqis, most of them civilians, are believed to have been killed in the war, along with nearly 4,500 U.S. troops. ( MORE: Viewpoint: Aleppo Gas Attack Shows How Little We Know About Syria’s Civil War ) It’s Desert Fox that looms as the most likely template for any military action the Obama Administration might take against Syria. The Pentagon has told the White House that it would require about 75,000 troops to secure Syria’s chemical weapons, which isn’t likely to happen. That leaves air strikes of limited duration as the most plausible way to destroy Syria’s chemical weapons and punish the Assad regime for their alleged use. But that isn’t as easy as it might sound. Zinni was the four-star general in charge during Desert Fox , and he doesn’t recall it fondly. “There wasn’t a single WMD target on the [target] list,” he says of the hundreds of strikes he oversaw. “They were all potential dual-use – like pesticide plants. That’s when I began having doubts about an ongoing Iraqi [WMD] program.” Beyond that, any military action to take out Syria’s chemical arsenal risks spewing plumes of the deadly agents and killing innocents in the way. “Hitting chemical-weapons storage areas,” Zinni observes, “sends those chemical weapons somewhere.” Israeli officials say the Americans are poised to attack, and could act within hours, if radical Islamists among the Syrian rebels appear to be on the verge of grabbing some of Assad’s chemical weapons. “This is a trial balloon,” an Israeli intelligence official says of Damascus’ alleged use of chemical weapons. “If the West doesn’t react, maybe they will use it larger amounts.” Obama finds himself in a pickle: if he does nothing, some will say Assad is pushing him around. If he orders an attack, he’s likely only to degrade, not destroy, Syria’s chemical weapons. Assuming, of course, that U.S. intelligence knows where they are. — With reporting by Aaron Klein/Jerusalem PHOTOS: Syria’s Slow-Motion Civil War Most Popular From U.S. Who Teaches SEAL Team 6 How to Fight?

AHMEDABAD: The special CBI court here today remanded suspended Gujarat police officer Narendra Amin in six-day (till April 12) CBI custody in college student Ishrat Jahan fake encounter killing case. CBI had sought 14 days' custody. Amin, a suspended deputy superintendent of Police, was arrested by the agency on Thursday from a hospital here. The order on CBI's remand application had been reserved by additional chief judicial magistrate H S Khutwad yesterday after Amin alleged torture. ""I was severely beaten up and also verbally abused by the CBI officers in custody,"" he had said. The court today asked the agency to take him for a medical check-up and see to it that his health was protected. Last month, he had got bail on medical grounds from the Bombay High Court in Sohrabuddin Sheikh fake encounter killing case. CBI maintained in the remand application that before the alleged encounter of Ishrat Jahan and three others, no cordon had been set up, contrary to police's claim. ""The incident did not happen in the way it was mentioned in the complaint,"" it said. ""The details of a widespread conspiracy to kill the deceased persons and the role played by each conspirator are yet not fully known. The accused person (Amin) knows these details and he has to be interrogated."" Mumbra-based Ishrat, Javed Shaikh alias Pranesh Pillai, Amjadali Akbarali Rana and Zeeshan Johar were killed in an alleged encounter by Ahmedabad Crime Branch on June 15, 2004 on Ahmedabad-Gandhinagar road. Police had then claimed that all four were terrorists who were on a mission to kill chief minister Narendra Modi. As per Gujarat police's version, Amin was a part of the team which had cordoned off the area near the encounter spot and also took part in shoot-out.

"Bird's-Eye View: Mr. President, meet Geffen, Shaked - The Jerusalem Post Advertisement JP Newsletter Israel News Health & Wellness WORLD NEWS Middle East Business & Innovation Opinion JP Store Login Log Out Archaeology Israel Real Estate Judaism Kabbalah Environment Antisemitism JP Spanish Podcasts JP Shopping Conversation Corner Premium Jerusalem Post Opinion Columnists Bird's-Eye View: Mr. President, meet Geffen, Shaked Israel saves more lives with its medical and technological breakthroughs than any other country. We trust you will see some of these modern miracle-workers when you arrive. By DANNY GROSSMAN FEBRUARY 28, 2013 21:38 Shaked and Geffen 370 (photo credit: Danny Grossman) Shalom, President Obama! I am sure that you are busy with preparations for your visit. As you can imagine, things have been more than a little hectic here recently as well. Here are two names of people you might want to meet: Geffen and Shaked. Allow me to explain. You touched the hearts of many Israelis when you visited Sderot in 2008, saying “If somebody was sending rockets into my house where my two daughters sleep at night, I would do everything to stop that, and would expect Israel to do the same thing.” Yet just last November, I found your words eerily prophetic and highly ironic. In the attached photo you can see our two-and- a-half-year-old granddaughter, Geffen, trying to distract her baby sister, Shaked, in the shelter where they slept during the attacks along with their mommy (while their daddy was away in the army). They live on a moshav near Sderot. So here we found ourselves, barely four years from your last visit, once again dancing to the same insane music orchestrated by terrorists who are hellbent on taking innocent life, and who cynically fire from populated areas, using Gazans as human shields. And while words cannot express our gratitude for your support of the Iron Dome missile defense system, let’s remember that despite its spectacular results, like any technology, it is not 100 percent foolproof. Try to imagine keeping track of an active three-year- old – even if she’s restricted to the house – knowing you have only 15 seconds to get her into the shelter when the siren goes off. Now try doing that while feeding, changing, or bathing her baby sister. My friend Dr. Ron Lobel, deputy director of Ashkelon’s Barzilai Medical Center, told me that young mothers were particularly subjected to unbelievable stress. Iron Dome saved many lives, but it cannot possibly negate the fear and anxiety that terrorists aim to sow among our population. In November 2012 you recalled how personally you took this situation: “And I was reminded of what that would mean if those were my kids. Which is why as president, we funded an Iron Dome program to stop those missiles.” Stay updated with the latest news! Subscribe to The Jerusalem Post Newsletter Subscribe Now Yet let’s be clear about Iron Dome. As genuine as your empathy and admirable as your support of Israel may be, Iron Dome is not simply about stopping missiles. Nor is it merely a case of the US stepping up to the plate on behalf of the Jewish state. Iron Dome is in the heart of the envelope of US interests. Its firepower goes far beyond the battlefield. Iron Dome provides leaders, including both Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu and you personally, with precious time and maneuvering room. Consider this barely hypothetical question: Had there been no Iron Dome (and the more than 90% of rockets reached their destination rather than be intercepted), could any Israeli leader have been able to withstand the demands of his people to wage a major offensive to remove the threat? Could any US president deny this legitimate need (in your own words “I would do everything to stop that, and would expect Israel to do the same thing”)? Simply stated, Iron Dome, and defensive systems like it, take the cards out of the hands of the terrorists and place them back in the hands of more rational players. So while you were right about supporting Iron Dome, the time has come to stop painting it in terms of a good deed America is doing for Israel. You have consistently said the right things regarding Iran as well. During the same 2008 Sderot visit, you addressed the Iranian danger, saying, “A nuclear Iran would pose a grave threat and the world must prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.” I will be delighted if nothing is said on this visit regarding Iran. The messages have been clearly stated. The only thing I would ask is that you consider how different the picture would look if Geffen and Shaked might be facing an atomic threat. Again, the real threat to US interests might be expressed in similar pictures of their American cousins in New England, California and elsewhere who would quickly need to come to terms with nuclear devices in the hands of fanatical regimes or their proxies. So please let’s keep our signals straight regarding both US and Israeli interests. Obviously, the US will form its policy out of self-interest. Fortunately, key Israeli interests are usually in the heart of the same envelope. Too many people think that my fellow Israelis and co-religionists in America judge American leaders by asking, “Is he/she good for the Jews?” I always ask, “Is he good for America?” I commend Geffen and Shaked’s auntie – my daughter – who took it upon herself to educate our six family ballot-holders on the issues in the last US election. She devoured hundreds of articles, YouTube clips and debate broadcasts to help us make our decision. We may have argued about the candidates but never about how to vote: we all believe that whoever is best for America will be best for Israel. The strongest possible USA is what we all wish for. The flip side to this is equally true: Israel at its best is in America’s primary interest. Israel is a stable and democratic ally. It saves more lives with its medical and technological breakthroughs than any other country. We trust you will see some of these modern miracle-workers when you arrive. So on behalf of Geffen, Shaked and their parents, thanks again for everything. We look forward to your visit.

        3:48 PM EDT, Thu April 25, 2013 Link Copied! Workers chat at Consol Energy horizontal gas drilling rig, fracking the Marcellus shale near Waynesburg, Pennsylvania. MLADEN ANTONOV/AFP/Getty Images Editor’s Note: Phil Radford is the executive director of Greenpeace . Mark Ruffalo is an actor and anti-fracking activist. Story highlights Writers: Natural gas fracking releases methane, a big contributor to global warming Industry calls natural gas a ""bridge fuel,"" they say, but it just puts off developing clean energy Writers: Natural gas burns less carbon, but emits methane and pollutes water sources It's more of the same from fossil fuel industry, they say, whose answer to opponents is ridicule CNN — Even the heads of fossil fuel companies read the polls. They know the majority of Americans see global warming as an imminent threat and a clear sign that the way we use energy must change. But instead of offering the solar and wind choices America wants, fossil fuel companies like Shell, Exxon and Duke are offering what might be their most disastrous bait and switch yet: natural gas. The bait? Burning natural gas is “clean” because it produces less carbon pollution than burning oil and coal. The switch? The catastrophic pollution caused when companies like Exxon fracture the earth – commonly called fracking – to get natural gas out of the ground. These corporations know America is ready for change. They see motivated, forward-thinking companies like Apple , Google and Facebook committing to a clean energy future that threatens to leave dirty energy out in the cold, so they’ve done what they do best: come up with a slogan instead of a solution. The industry, its investors and its apologists are insisting that the only way we can go from dirty to clean, oil and coal to solar and wind, is through its “bridge fuel,” natural gas. People protest fracking outside  the California Environmental Protection Agency in Sacramento last year. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images The Bridge Fuel Club holds fast to the idea that the U.S. isn’t ready to transition to renewable energy. Despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary, the Bridge Fuel Club insists that the only way to get our carbon footprint to a manageable size in the long term is to go all-in on its next, best fossil fuel, one that happens to light faucets on fire and leak methane into the atmosphere at astonishing rates . It’s not a real crisis, they say, it’s simply time for rebranding, from drilling to hydraulic fracturing. In fracking, long horizontal wells are drilled in shale rocks sometimes a mile deep. Huge amounts of water, sand and chemicals are pumped into the wells at high pressure, which breaks open the shale so the trapped gas escapes to the surface. Phil Radford Mark Ruffalo Ben Gabbe/Getty Images) If we listen to the Bridge Fuel Club, we’ll go from “spill, baby, spill” to “fracked” in no time – and put our long-term chances to solve the climate crisis in serious jeopardy. Fracking protest catches agency’s eye Get our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion’s new newsletter. Join us on Twitter and Facebook Swapping coal pollution for natural gas pollution is not a global warming solution. But companies like Exxon, Shell, and Duke want to use the urgency around climate emergencies like Hurricane Sandy and widespread drought to get us hooked on natural gas. Just like they’ve done for generations with their other fossil fuels, they want to privatize the profits while making us pay the costs of their work. Photo essay: Taking from the land – fracking on reservations Unfortunately for the industry, the long-term science has started rolling in, and it shows natural gas to be big trouble.  Although burning natural gas has less impact on the climate than other fossil fuels, once you take into account the damage done from extraction, it’s clear natural gas is a lose-lose. In fact, methane pollution from natural gas has the potential to be an even more severe driver of global warming than carbon pollution from oil and coal. That means it’s a bridge fuel to nowhere. The Environmental Protection Agency says natural gas  is 21 times worse than carbon dioxide, but that alarming rate may in itself be a gross underestimate. Studies continue to show methane’s long-term climate impact may be far worse than initially predicted because of the intensity of methane’s interaction with aerosol in the atmosphere. In addition, a recent study led by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association showed that natural gas production sites in places like Utah and Colorado are leaking methane at “eye-popping” rates, far greater than what the industry reports. eitm fracking_00001927 video Related video CNN Explains: Fracking But where the fossil fuel industry wants us to delay any work on clean energy while there is some fabricated doubt about climate change, it wants to go full frack ahead on natural gas – despite clear evidence against natural gas from the scientific community. Of course, for the industry, natural gas isn’t as much of an energy transition as a slight modification to its current business models, one that keeps all the subsidies and lobbyists right where they are. For them, it seems like a slam dunk – except committed communities across the U.S. aren’t buying it. If we listen to the Bridge Fuel Club, we’ll go from ‘spill, baby, spill’ to ‘fracked’ in no time Phil Radford and Mark Ruffalo Watch: ‘Avengers’ star Ruffalo is the ‘green monster fighting for the environment’ The industry is trying to bully the locals into giving up their land, pitting itself against New Yorkers, Ohioans, Illinoisians and Pennsylvanians. The movement’s momentum clearly has the industry on its back foot, so they’re trying new tactics like character assassination and slander. By claiming that people across the social spectrum don’t like fracking simply because it’s happening in their backyards, the industry and its apologists are showing contempt for democracy in its rawest form. In New York state, the resistance to fracking is grounded in communities most threatened by it. Mark’s family home is smack dab in the middle of what the fossil fuel industry wants to make the Gaslands of New York state. It’s a treasure of watersheds, developing organic food sources, and unindustrialized open spaces. A vibrant and diversified community of farmers, craftspeople, artists, entrepreneurs, restaurant owners, tourism operators, and homeowners  live there, all of whom would be devastated by the natural gas industry. This engaged community is demanding that there be no natural gas extraction on their lands until the long-term risks and dangers are fully understood. These New Yorkers have seen other communities in neighboring states like Pennsylvania run over by an industry that promised them heaps of cash, but instead the communities report groundwater contamination , contaminated flow-back waste, road-ripping truck traffic and clouds of cancer-causing chemicals. As well as that, a recent report found that many of Pennsylvania’s energy policymakers and regulators have come from the oil and gas industry . Anti-fracking communities know that the barriers to clean energy are political, not practical. They want to see a better way. That’s why they are joined by many national environmental groups and activists from coast to coast, and also why the Bridge Fuel Club is so scared of them. The more people who point out that natural gas is a bridge fuel to nowhere, the closer we get to a clean energy future. Follow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion. Join us on Facebook/CNNOpinion.

"In a win for Apple, Motorola’s proximity sensor patent ruled too obvious - Ars Technica Skip to content Ars Technica home Sections Forum Subscribe AI Biz & IT Cars Culture Gaming Health Policy Science Security Space Tech Feature Reviews Store AI Biz & IT Cars Culture Gaming Health Policy Science Security Space Tech Forum Subscribe Theme Light Dark System Sign In There's a patent for that In a win for Apple, Motorola’s proximity sensor patent ruled too obvious Trade panel eliminates Motorola's last remaining hope for an iPhone import ban. Timothy B. Lee – Apr 22, 2013 8:10 pm 71 The International Trade Commission, an obscure administrative body that has become an increasingly popular venue for patent disputes, has sided with Apple in its fight against Motorola Mobility. The Google subsidiary filed a complaint with the ITC in 2010 alleging that Apple had violated 18 Motorola patents. The company asked the panel to ban iPhone imports. After siding with Apple on other patents earlier in the process, the ITC rejected Motorola's final remaining patent in a Monday ruling. Monday's decision focused on Patent No. 6,246,862 , ""Sensor controlled user interface for portable communication device."" It covers the concept of using a proximity sensor to automatically disable a device's touchscreen. This technique is used by the iPhone and other modern smart phones to avoid accidental input when the user puts the phone to his or her face to make a phone call. The ITC concluded that the concept was too obvious to merit patent protection. The fight at the ITC is just one front in the sprawling patent battle between Apple and Motorola. Federal judges have thrown out lawsuits between the firms in Illinois , Wisconsin , and Florida. The companies are also fighting over patents in Germany, where Apple won a sales ban on some Motorola products last September. A Google spokesman told Bloomberg that the company was ""evaluating our options."" Apple had no comment. Timothy B. Lee Senior tech policy reporter Timothy B.

Pyongyang announced on Monday it would withdraw all of its employees from the industrial zone which it runs jointly with its southern neighbor. The move was in protest against what it called ""provocations"" by the South. North Korea also claimed that Seoul was using Kaesong to find a pretext for fuelling tensions. According to a Unification Ministry source, North Korean workers did not report to work and buses to take the workers to their workplaces have been cancelled. South Korean President Park Geun-hye described the move as 'very disappointing.' 'If North Korea breaches international regulations and promises like this, there will be no countries or companies that would make investments in North Korea,' Yonhap quoted the president as saying. 'North Korea should halt wrong behavior and make the right choice for the sake of the entire future of the Korean people.' Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se warned North Korea about ""deeper isolation."" 'North Korea, instead of developing missiles and weapons of mass destruction, must take care of its people first, who are suffering from the hardships of want, poverty and destitution,' the minister said. 'The international community, including Korea, stands ready to help, should North Korea make the right choice.' Last week, North Korean authorities banned South Korean specialists from entering the zone, but said that South Koreans already there are free to leave it. Out of 800 South Koreans working in the zone, about 475 remained there, including 77 who are to leave during the day. Production at Kaesong started in late 2004. The zone, located some 12 km from the demarcation line between the North and the South, houses 123 small and medium-sized South Korean enterprises that employ 53,000 North Koreans. The companies produce $40 million worth of goods every month and pay $87 million per year in salaries.

The military said it struck ""a terrorist weapon storage facility and a Hamas training installation"" early Sunday. Gaza health officials said nobody was hurt. The military said it was responding to Gaza rockets fired at Israel the night before that landed in an open field causing no injuries. Gaza attacks on Israel have declined since a military campaign in November, but sporadic fire persists. Israel holds Gaza's militant Hamas rulers responsible for all attacks from the territory. A shadowy extremist Muslim Salafi group was behind recent attacks, including one last month. Hamas sees the Salafis as a threat to its rule while Salafis view Hamas as too moderate.

SEARCH HOMEPAGE 0 Republican Benghazi Report Alleges State Department Coverup A new report keys in on the space between what the White House knew, and what it chose to publicly say. Eli Lake reports. Eli Lake Updated Jul. 11, 2017 11:29PM EDT / Published Apr. 23, 2013 7:09PM EDT Chip Somodevilla/Getty Internal emails in the week following the 9-11 anniversary assault on the U.S. facility in Benghazi show the White House and State Department removed references to al Qaeda and the mention of other recent attacks in Benghazi from widely distributed talking points used to explain the incident to the public, according to a new report from five House Republican committee chairmen released Tuesday afternoon. Citing administration emails provided to the House committees, the 46-page report claims that “to protect the State Department, the Administration deliberately removed references to al-Qaeda-linked groups and previous attacks in Benghazi in the talking points used by Ambassador Rice.” While the report does not disclose in full the still-classified emails or the officials who wrote them, it does give the clearest account to date of how the official public statements in the days after September 11, 2012 from the Obama administration departed from the classified assessments of the attack that killed Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans. The story begins on Friday, September 14, when then-CIA director David Petraeus briefed the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence about the Benghazi attack three days earlier. The CIA’s notes for that briefing included information about five previous attacks on foreign interests in Benghazi since April 2012; potential links to the al Qaeda connected Libyan militia, Ansar al-Sharia; previous CIA assessments of groups linked to al Qaeda in eastern Libya; and information suggesting Islamic extremists participated in the attack, according to the report. But then the editing process began later that day on September 14, “[w]hen draft talking points were sent to officials throughout the Executive Branch, [and] senior State Department officials requested the talking points be changed to avoid criticism for ignoring the threat environment in Benghazi,” the report charges. The report quotes one email saying there was concern that members of Congress would attack the State Department for “not paying attention to Agency warnings” regarding the mounting threat in Benghazi. A meeting convened by the White House on Saturday suggested further edits to the talking points, according to the report. While a senior CIA official eventually changed the talking points, the report says those changes were made at the behest of the White House and the State Department. “Those edits struck any and all suggestions that the State Department had been previously warned of threats in the region, that there had been previous attacks in Benghazi by al-Qaeda-linked groups in Benghazi and eastern Libya, and that extremists linked to al-Qaeda may have participated in the attack on the Benghazi Mission,” according to the report. On Sunday the new talking points were provided to the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Susan Rice, who based her comments about the attack on major Sunday news shows on September 16 on the newly edited talking points. Rice ended up suggesting that the lethal assault on the Benghazi compound was spurred by a demonstration against an anti-Muslim Internet video. The State Department’s own accountability review board eventually acknowledged last year that there was no demonstration the night the Benghazi compound was raided and set ablaze. Rice’s appearance on those shows appeared to cost her a widely expected nomination as secretary of State, after Senate Republicans threatened to hold up the nomination because of her comments about Benghazi. White House national security staff spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden dismissed the Republican authored report Tuesday. “The report just released by the House Republican Conference on Benghazi appears to raise questions that have already been asked and answered in great detail by the Administration,” she said in a statement to The Daily Beast. “We have taken extraordinary steps to work with five different committees in Congress in investigating what happened before, during, and after the Benghazi attacks.” Hayden went on to say the Obama administration has provided more than 10,000 pages of documents, that senior officials have appeared before 10 Congressional hearings and that the administration has allowed members of Congress to view “classified video footage from the night of the attacks.” The five ranking Democratic members of the committees who drafted the report sent a letter Tuesday to House Speaker John Boehner urging him to withdraw what they called a “partisan report.” The five lawmakers wrote, “Although staff reports may be appropriate in some circumstances, we do not believe a partisan staff report should be used in this case, which involves the death of a U.S. Ambassador and three other Americans and is based on sensitive and classified national security information.” Administration officials have told Congress and said publicly that one reason the talking points were changed was to protect classified information. The Republican report, however, said there was no evidence to support that charge. “There were no concerns about protecting classified information in the email traffic,” the report said. The report also notes that then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton signed an April 19, 2012 cable offering a plan to scale back security assets for the U.S. missions in Libya, including Benghazi. Administration officials have also said the talking points were purposefully vague in order to protect the integrity of the FBI’s investigation into the attacks. But a footnote in the report quotes an email from a senior State Department official saying that the Bureau “did not have major concerns” with the talking points, and only offered minor corrections.

"Yishai publicly slams Amsalem; MK appointed bodyguard - The Jerusalem Post Advertisement JP Newsletter Israel News Health & Wellness WORLD NEWS Middle East Business & Innovation Opinion JP Store Login Log Out Archaeology Israel Real Estate Judaism Kabbalah Environment Antisemitism JP Spanish Podcasts JP Shopping Conversation Corner Premium Jerusalem Post Yishai publicly slams Amsalem; MK appointed bodyguard Shas newspaper compares maverick lawmaker to Amalek; lawyer files complaint on threats, incitement to violence appearing in newspaper. By JONAH MANDEL NOVEMBER 25, 2010 21:49 Eli Yishai (photo credit: Ariel Jerozolimski) In his first public statements on the maelstrom raging in Shas around MK Rabbi Haim Amsalem, party chairman Eli Yishai spent an hour on Thursday lashing out against the lawmaker. Amsalem is refusing to resign from the Knesset, despite the demands of the party’s spiritual leadership. RELATED: Shas's Torah Sages publish letter slamming Amsalem Amsalem defies Ovadia Yosef’s order to quit Knesset “Nobody knew who he was a minute before he joined Shas,” Yishai said in an interview with Radio Kol Berama, which is affiliated with Shas. As for the possibility of Amsalem forming a new political party, Yishai said that “without a rabbinical council of leaders behind him, not even his wife would vote for him.” Amsalem was recently officially ousted from the party for expressing opinions such as that only a select minority should dedicate their lives to Torah scholarship, while the others should combine work with study; that non-Jews in Israel from the former Soviet Union with Jewish roots should be provided an easier way into converting to Judaism; that everyone should acquire the basic skills of mathematics and a foreign language, as provided in the state’s core curriculum; and that Sephardic Judaism should not bow its head before the Ashkenazi Lithuanian haredi leadership, which Amsalem says Shas is doing in its stances on matters of religion and education. Yishai also denied Amsalem’s assertion that he and others prevented the MK from meeting with Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, head of the Shas Council of Torah Sages, in order to truthfully present his stances on Torah scholarship, employment, secular studies and conversions. “There wasn’t even one time that Amsalem wanted to meet with him and he couldn’t,” Yishai said, and added that recently “Yosef himself told his secretary he doesn’t want to meet with Amsalem, since he doesn’t listen to him and distorts his opinion.” Amsalem did not respond to Yishai’s interview. Earlier on Thursday, Shas newspaper Yom Leyom took the hostilities against Amsalem to new heights, comparing the lawmaker to Amalek. Stay updated with the latest news! Subscribe to The Jerusalem Post Newsletter Subscribe Now The front page of the weekly paper, as well as much of a supplement, were dedicated to Amsalem, the Shas Council of Torah Sages’s Monday decision, and elaborations on the “sinful ways” of the MK. “We demand of Mr. Haim Amsalem by the law of Torah to return his mandate to Shas,” the four-man body of senior Sephardi rabbis had written in their edict. “If he doesn’t do so, he is a thief in broad daylight... And we call on all of those who care about the Torah to keep far away from him and his strange and heretical opinions.” A wealth of quotes from the council’s decision condemning Amsalem, strongly worded by council head Yosef, were quoted and analyzed by various writers throughout the newspaper. But Ron Halevy, writing in the supplement, outdid all others in comparing Amsalem to a biblical-era foe whom Jews are ordered to eradicate. Writing about the “vast damage” that Amsalem’s “empty claims” have caused, Halevy wrote that “with arrogance and boastfulness, that man did the deed of Amalek who the Torah orders us to wipe out his memory, ‘who met thee by the way.’” The verse from Deuteronomy continues, “and smote the hindmost of thee.” The Knesset’s master of arms on Thursday ordered a bodyguard to accompany Amsalem at all times. Amsalem’s office said that “the incitement in wall posters and newspapers that are tantamount to wall posters is very severe. The comparison to Amalek has but one meaning that is clear and dangerous. This is certainly not the way of Torah.” Sources close to Amsalem were undecided on what they would do in response to the alleged incitement, but Idan Abuhav, a private attorney, decided on his own to both file a complaint with the Tel Aviv police about threats and incitement to violence, as well as write a letter to State Attorney Moshe Lador and Attorney-General Yehuda Weinstein asking that they order a criminal investigation into the implicit incitement to violence in the newspaper. “We secular folk cannot sit on the sidelines and observe how a haredi MK with an agenda of bringing the publics closer to one another, encouraging haredim to join the workforce and study core curriculum subjects, will be the victim of combined attack from all sides,” Abuhav told The Jerusalem Post . Abuhav stressed that his complaint was not against the council and its harshly worded decision, nor against Shas, and noted his good working relations with some of the party’s other members. This is only against the statements in Yom Leyom that contain violent incitement, he said. “We’ve already seen a public figure [prime minister Yitzhak Rabin] here murdered in part due to talk and an atmosphere created. In this case we should be all the more cautious, and not let every bully say what they want,” Abuhav said.

"USA TODAY Skip to main content Home U.S. Sports Entertainment Life Money Tech Travel Opinion For Subscribers Weather Investigations Crosswords Humankind Newsletters Media For You Contributor Content Obama: Health care law will work David Jackson, USA TODAY |  USATODAY President Obama said Tuesday there will be ""glitches and bumps"" as the health care law is put into place, but the ultimate benefits will be worth it. The law he signed in 2010 will fulfill his goal ""that in a country as wealthy as ours, nobody should go bankrupt if they get sick,"" Obama said during a White House news conference. Obama was responding to a question about comments by Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., that implementation could be a potential ""train wreck."" The president said the law is already providing benefits for 85%-90% of Americans who have health insurance, ""even if they don't know it."" Insurance companies can't drop them for ""bad reasons,"" there is ""free preventive care,"" and children can stay on their parents' policies until age 26, he said. ""The implementation issues come in for those who don't have health insurance,"" Obama said, either because of pre-existing conditions or cost. He said that group totals some 30 million Americans. ""What we're doing is we're setting up a pool so that they can all pool together and get a better deal from insurance companies,"" he said. ""And those who can't afford it, we're going to provide them with some subsidies."" Said Obama: ""Even if we do everything perfectly, there will still be glitches and bumps ... And that's pretty much true of every government program that's ever been set up."" Congressional Republicans, in addition to echoing Baucus' criticisms, cited polls showing increased confusion and opposition to the health care plan. Don Stewart, a spokesman for Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said the news conference ""was a perfect time for the president to use his communication skills to address the nation and explain the consequences that are headed their way.

ISLAMABAD: A Pakistani anti-terrorism court (ATC) on Tuesday ordered the inclusion of ex-president Pervez Musharraf 's name in the investigations into former PM Benazir Bhutto 's assassination in 2007. The order came after the Federal Investigation Agency, probing Bhutto's assassination in a gun and bomb attack in Rawalpindi in December 2007, informed the court that Musharraf's name had not been formally included in the case. ATC judge Chaudhry Habib-ur-Rehman ordered the agency to complete its investigations and submit a report to the supreme court before adjourning the hearing till May 3. A 57-page report submitted before the court had accused Musharraf of failing to provide requisite security to prevent Bhutto's assassination despite being aware of dangers to her life. Musharraf dismissed all charges against him as politically motivated and insisted that he had warned Bhutto of the threats. ""...but she had ignored the advice.'' The ATC had earlier in February 2011 declared the ex-military ruler an absconder after he failed to appear before it. He was granted bail in the case as he returned home after a four-year self-imposed exile last month to contest elections.

Some information may no longer be current. Toronto City Mayor Rob Ford greets the crowd before speaking in front of unionized workers prior to chairing the executive committee hearing at Toronto City Hall as they debate the proposed Casino for city on Monday April 15 , 2013. Share Toronto Mayor Rob Ford says a city report that recommends funding transit expansion by charging motorists more to drive and park could run out of gas before it reaches the council floor. The report, released last week and scheduled to go to the mayor's cabinet-like executive committee Tuesday, urged the recommendation of four revenue tools: a parking levy, increased sales and fuel taxes, and new charges on development. The mayor, speaking with a small group of reporters at city hall Monday, said it's possible the report won't make it past executive. ""I personally won't be supporting it. I know a couple of my executive members aren't going to support it. … It very well could get filed,"" he said. Mayor Ford has previously said the money to fund transit could be found through efficiencies, instead of new revenue tools. Metrolinx, the regional transit agency, has been tasked with finding a funding strategy for transportation expansion. It is in the midst of drafting an investment strategy designed to raise the $2-billion a year to fund new transit. Councillor David Shiner, a member of the mayor's executive, said he, too, does not support the new revenue tools. He said the provincial government already has the money to build transit. ""Stop telling people in this city, in this province, you have to pay more and more and more. People are fed up,"" he said, adding he does not want to send the issue on to council. But Councillor Michael Thompson, who's also a member of executive and chair of the economic development committee, said he's not ruling the new revenue tools out. ""We have to have a real intelligent discussion around that. None of us is in favour of more taxing and charging and what have you. But I think that there are some things in that we're going to have to seriously look at in terms of implementing,"" he said. Councillor Thompson said he's prepared to pay a little more ""to have transit that my great grand-kids can actually enjoy in the city."" Councillor Norm Kelly, another executive member, has advocated for a regional sales tax to pay for transit in the past and said he would have to know how else the city might fund transit before he voted to shelve the staff report. ""I would like an explanation of the alternatives,"" he said. He said it will ultimately be up to the province to answer the funding question. Councillor Paula Fletcher, who is not on executive, said councillors need to debate the funding issue and have a position to send to the province. ""The head-in-sand approach really needs to end,"" she said, responding to the possibility that the mayor will try to bury the report.

The terrorist blacklist was obtained from the UN Security Council, according to Anti-Money Laundering Office secretary-general Seehanat Prayoonrat. The announcement is aimed at convincing the Paris-based Financial Action Task Force that the country is cracking down on money laundering and terrorist financing activities. The black list of terrorists includes only foreign groups and individuals, it comprises 227 individuals and 64 organisations, Seehanat said. After the announcement by Justice Minister Pracha Promnok, the government will report its action to the Asia/Pacific Group on Money Laundering (APG) in Sydney. The FATF is the global body that sets standards for anti-money laundering and terrorism finance laws. In February last year, the FATF named Thailand as one of 15 countries on its dark-grey list due to its failure to take adequate steps against money laundering and terrorist financing. The FATF in February agreed to upgrade Thailand's status from dark grey to grey following the passage of two bills to amend the Anti-Money Laundering Act and the Anti-Terrorism Act. Thailand hopes the changes in the laws will help convince the FATF to remove Thailand from its watch list. The FATF will send a team to visit Thailand next month to evaluate the measures and how well they are being enforced. Thailand says its removal from the list would be a big boost as it prepares to join the ASEAN Economic Community in 2015. Get Rediff News in your Inbox: email Source: PTI © Copyright 2024 PTI.

In 1990, Margaret Thatcher emerged as one of the first world leaders to champion climate science, issuing a call to action to fight manmade global warming at the Second World Climate Conference hosted at the Palais des Nations in Geneva. She lavished praise on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, then in its infancy, and laid out the conservatives' case for environmental stewardship in the face of climate change. ""I see the adoption of these policies as a sort of premium on insurance against fire, flood or other disaster,"" she said . ""It may be cheaper or more cost-effective to take action now than to wait and find we have to pay much more later."" Advertisement She would later recant many of her positions, however, adopting an increasingly skeptical stance. Although some maintain that she was consistent in her advocacy for the environment, more than 10 years later, she publicly criticized the push to protect it. Her speech in Geneva acknowledged the uncertainty of the science behind climate change, before vigorously affirming that ""the need for more research should not be an excuse for delaying much needed action now ... there is already a clear case for precautionary action at an international level."" A year before, in an address to the United Nations General Assembly in New York she urged the global community to take action. ""The evidence is there. The damage is being done. What do we, the international community, do about it? … It is no good squabbling over who is responsible or who should pay. We have to look forward not backward, and we shall only succeed in dealing with the problems through a vast international, co-operative effort."" Advertisement She called for the United Nations to ratify a treaty by 1992. The New York Times covered it at the time with the headline: ""Thatcher Urges Pact On Climate."" Excerpts from some of her climate-change speeches are here . But in 2003, she backtracked on her climate advocacy, calling climate activism a ""marvelous excuse for supra-national socialism,"" and denouncing Al Gore's calls for international cooperation around climate change ""apocalyptic hyperbole."" In her 2003 book Statecraft she wrote of ""a new dogma about climate change has swept through the left-of-center governing classes,"" praised former President George W. Bush for rejecting the Kyoto Protocol and bemoaned the “costly and economically damaging” schemes to limit carbon emissions.

While it would appear Thatcher, who died on Monday at age 87, did a complete 180 on the issue, Iain Murray with the Competitive Enterprise Institute in Washington, D.C., has argued that she remained an environmentalist. ""Thatcher's environmentalism is founded on Edmund Burke's conservative view of our inheritance as being worth defending,"" he wrote.

Image by Chelsea Gortmaker Hundreds rally at the state Capitol to support sustainable energy Monday, April 22, 2013, in St. Paul. University students attended the rally in support of renewable energy bills. by Hailey Colwell Published  April 23, 2013 Dozens of students elbowed their way into the packed state Capitol rotunda Monday to rally for green jobs and bolster Earth Day spirit. The students joined citizens and policymakers to hear Gov. Mark Dayton, U.S. Rep. Keith Ellison, environmentalist Will Steger and other speakers call for support to raise state renewable energy standards and create jobs. “Working on policy isn’t the most fun or sexy thing for students to do, but it’s really important,” said Greta Neubauer, a sophomore at Middlebury College in Vermont who is traveling the country to learn about the national fossil fuel divestment campaign. Organizations from across the state launched the Minnesota Clean Energy and Jobs campaign earlier this year. Campaigners encouraged legislators to raise the state’s renewable energy standard to 40 percent and solar energy standard to 10 percent by 2030 and save consumers money by making it easier to generate efficient and local power. As a University of Minnesota senior, Racquel Maronde said she cares about the availability of green jobs in the future. “This is a field that needs to grow,” she said. Maronde said having students from so many different schools at the Capitol proves this is an issue that affects all young people. “Seeing young faces at events like this get people’s attention and makes people realize that we do care and it does matter to us and our future,” University sophomore Katy Nordhagen said. As Ellison addressed the crowd of environmentalists, his statements were met with roaring applause. “The defining issue of our time is climate change,” Ellison said. “Not only us as human beings, but the species of this world cannot live with what we’re doing to it with fossil fuel.” He urged attendees to retain the enthusiasm they showed at the rally to show government officials what clean energy means to them. “We can talk about energy,” Ellsion said, “but the energy in this room can fuel the change we need.” A cultural shift Minneapolis mayoral candidate Mark Andrew said he participated in the first-ever Earth Day celebration in front of Coffman Union as a University student in 1970. “All of these years later,” he said, “we’ve come so far and yet we have so far to go.” Andrew said the enthusiasm behind the campaign was among the strongest he’d seen on Earth Day — and students greatly contributed to it. “These are tomorrow’s leaders, and they are imbued with a sense of purpose around the environment,” he said. “To be able to come out and be a part of what has become a national tradition is a powerful statement that the environment will continue to be a priority in this generation.” Augsburg College junior Ellie Klueger said she attended the event because some people fear clean energy will take away jobs. She said it was refreshing to be surrounded by people who believe the two can go together, especially since many of them were students. “It shows a great shift in our culture,” she said. In addition to rallying, Augsburg freshman Hannah Withers said it’s important for students to talk to state representatives to voice their support of clean energy. “We are a collective generation of people who really care about the future,” Withers said. “It doesn’t matter how old we are. We’re part of what’s happening now, and we’re part of what’s going to happen tomorrow.” View Story Comments 0 Like This Story Share on Facebook Share on X Email this Story Print this Story Leave a Comment More to Discover More in Uncategorized Paisley Purple potato debuts at local restaurant Fried food, butter sculptures and lines at the Minnesota State Fair Suni Lee bounces to bronze medal in Olympic all-around, Biles grabs gold Pathways to drug addiction recovery around campus Taste of Minnesota showcases the state’s culinary diversity Bongs, edibles and beyond: the cool and crazy items at Hideaway Advertisement Facebook Instagram X LinkedIn RSS Feed 2221 University Ave. SE, STE 450 Minneapolis, MN 55414 (612) 435-5657 Sections News Administration Activities Opinion Arts & Entertainment Sports Multimedia MN Daily Archive About the Daily About Us Contact Us Content Diversity Send us a News Tip Donate Advertise with the Daily Sponsored Content Corrections Archives Policies & Procedures Terms and Conditions News & Ethics Policy Privacy Policy Freelance Policy Online Commenting Press Releases Letters to the Editor & Op-Eds Content Removal Request 2221 University Ave. SE, STE 450 Minneapolis, MN 55414 Phone: (612)435-5657 Email: [email protected] Open Navigation Menu The Minnesota Daily About Us Contact Us Content Diversity Send Us a News Tip Donate Advertise with the Daily Sponsored Content Corrections Archives Terms and Conditions Privacy Policy News & Ethics Policy Freelance Policy Online Commenting Press Releases Letters to the Editor & Op-Eds Content Removal Request More The Minnesota Daily • © 2024 The Minnesota Daily • Privacy Policy • FLEX Pro WordPress Theme by SNO • Log in Accessibility Toolbar close Toggle the visibility of the Accessibility Toolbar keyboard Keyboard Navigation visibility_off Disable Animations nights_stay Contrast format_size Increase Text text_fields Decrease Text font_download Readable Font title Mark Titles link Highlight Links & Buttons Powered with favorite Love by Codenroll Comments (0) Share your thoughts...

Local and military officials say the fighting Tuesday in Hawija, near Kirkuk, began when security forces tried to arrest people at a protest camp, and that at least two soldiers are among the dead from a gun battle. The clashes are among the fiercest since thousands of Sunni protesters began staging demonstrations to demand an end to perceived discrimination by Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki's Shi'ite-led government. Sunni activists want Mr. Maliki to step down, accusing the government of arbitrarily arresting Sunni opponents and holding them without charges. Iraq's Education Minister Mohammed Tamim, a Sunni Muslim, submitted his resignation on Tuesday in protest at the raid, the deputy prime minister's office said in a statement. U.N. envoy Martin Kobler on Monday had called for calm in the area. He urged security forces to exercise restraint and for protesters to preserve peaceful demonstrations.

"2 Arabs guilty of Baku attack plot - The Jerusalem Post Advertisement JP Newsletter Israel News Health & Wellness WORLD NEWS Middle East Business & Innovation Opinion JP Store Login Log Out Archaeology Israel Real Estate Judaism Kabbalah Environment Antisemitism JP Spanish Podcasts JP Shopping Conversation Corner Premium Jerusalem Post World News 2 Arabs guilty of Baku attack plot 2 Lebanese plotted Baku By JPOST.COM STAFF OCTOBER 5, 2009 16:00 A court in Azerbaijan on Monday found two Lebanese men guilty of planning attacks on the Israeli embassy in Baku, AFP reported.

AFP quoted a court spokesman as saying that ""Lebanese citizens Ali Karaki and Ali Najmeddin were sentenced to 15 years each"" for plotting attacks on the Israeli and US embassies in the Azerbaijani capital.

They also planned to attack a missile-detection station in the north of the country.

The two men, who were apparently Hizbullah members, were ordered to avenge the February 2008 assassination of senior Hizbullah commander Imad Mughniyeh in Damascus.

A former intelligence chief at the US Treasury Department, Matthew Levitt, was quoted in a May Los Angeles Times report as saying that the choice of Baku last year reflects Iranian influence. He said that the plot was in its ""advanced stages"" when it was foiled.

""The Iranians have a history of a presence there,"" he was quoted as saying. ""And they wouldn't mind undermining the country, given Azerbaijan's Western leanings.""

Matters YOU US TNS Newspost Mafia tales March 17, 2020 Imparting education is a sacred profession. In all the civilised societies of the world, educational affairs are run both by the government and the private sector, keeping in view the betterment and welfare of a learner. But, unfortunately, here in Pakistan, imparting education has become a business. In Pakistan, private education has become very expensive and beyond the reach of a middle-class family. Private schools charge heavy tuition and other fees without really caring whether the parents/guardians of a child can afford the same or not. The administration of private schools doesn't allow children to sit in the classroom if their parents/guardians fail to deposit the demanded tuition fees. Thus, in Pakistan, private schools have become a virtual mafia. The respective federal and provincial governments need to establish their writ and do everything possible to save parents/guardians from the increasing tentacles of the the private schools' mafia.

Photo: Google Google needs to do more to engage with black and minority ethnic people in local communities, Diane Abbott has said, describing the company's east London Campus project as ""a spaceship landed in the East End, removed from the community it is in the middle of"". Speaking on the first anniversary of Google Campus, Abbott, who represents the neighbouring borough of Hackney & South Newington, told the Guardian that she had been surprised by the lack of diversity of such an important project for east London . ""This is a community that is two-thirds black and minority ethnic and yet Google looks very different to that. Taking Google at its word, that it really wants to include the community, it really has to do a lot more to involve black and Asian kids."" Abbott also said there are much more deep-rooted problems with how technology is taught in schools. ""The people who live around Silicon Roundabout have so much potential but the one thing I hear is that children are just not being taught the skills they need,"" she said. ""There needs to be a look at the curriculum and the dysfunctional gap between computer science and what is happening in the tech industry."" Abbott welcomed the open day initiative at Campus, in which 150 London schoolchildren were invited to meet and learn from local entrepreneurs, pitching their own business ideas and experimenting with Raspberry Pi computers. But she said she would like to see Google develop more of these projects in schools and colleges, particularly to encourage female talent, and make the Campus building more inviting for the local community. Campus was launched in partnership with TechHub, Central Working and SeedCamp to provide workspace, mentoring and networking for early-stage entrepreneurs. In its first 12 months it hosted 850 events for 60,000 people and has 10,000 members with 22 nationalities. Ethnicity of members has not been monitored but membership is open to all, via the Campus website. Most members are aged between 25-34 and women make up one in four – far high than the ratio of one in nine at the neighbouring Tech City initiative. Google does operate internal diversity schemes including the Black Google Network talent, Women@Google and Gaygle, which supports gay and lesbian staff. One developer, who did not want to be named, claimed that several female applicants for engineering roles at Google had been advised to pursue project management positions instead.

Advertisement But Ma acknowledges that Alibaba, the country's top e-commerce services provider, ""needs some luck"" to reach that objective. ""Luck takes time,"" he said. The opportunity for mobile e-commerce is huge, with the mainland's 1.15 billion total mobile subscribers at the end of March. By comparison, there were 242 million mainland internet users who shopped online last year. On Monday, Hangzhou-based Alibaba forged a strategic alliance that could help shorten its learning curve in the mobile space and quickly raise its profile to a vast new audience. Alibaba, through a wholly owned subsidiary, agreed to invest US$586 million and take an 18 per cent stake in Weibo, the Twitter-like microblogging service with more than 503 million users. It is owned by Nasdaq-listed Sina, a leading online media company based in Shanghai. Advertisement The two companies will initially co-operate in the areas of user account connectivity, data exchange, online payment, online marketing, search and mobile internet services. They will also explore new business models for social e-commerce based on the interactions of the hundreds of millions of users on Weibo and on Alibaba's various e-commerce platforms.

""How do we know they are not ripping off taxpayers? That's a great question, said Caltrans spokesman Mark Dinger. Caltrans officials say Eric Blaine Hodgson, 43, took advantage of the honor system and stole $1.9 million dollars from California taxpayers by falsifying invoices for years without getting caught. Hodgson's company, Phenix Print & Image in Elk Grove, was raided by state agents Wednesday. He was hired in 2008 to create print ads that would advertise new construction contracts to bidders. Caltrans officials said he would create phony ads representing newspapers and publications and turn in the fake ads to Caltrans as proof, and then get a check. ""When we checked the actual newspapers, that's when we discovered the fraud,"" Dinger said. That was four years, and nearly $2 million later. The state says before he was caught, Hodgson allegedly used taxpayer money to pay off his mortgage, purchase toys and comics, and go on exotic trips around the world. Caltrans says those contractors who use the honor system and only provide documentation can sometimes be problematic for state auditors. ""When it comes to documentation that's supplied to us from our contractors that's where the grey area occur,"" Dinger said.

"Editor's Notes: Light in the darkness - The Jerusalem Post Advertisement JP Newsletter Israel News Health & Wellness WORLD NEWS Middle East Business & Innovation Opinion JP Store Login Log Out Archaeology Israel Real Estate Judaism Kabbalah Environment Antisemitism JP Spanish Podcasts JP Shopping Conversation Corner Premium Jerusalem Post Opinion Op-EdContributors Editor's Notes: Light in the darkness Shavei Israel, the primary outreach organization to Polish Jews holds a moving Shabbaton near Auschwitz. By STEVE LINDE APRIL 11, 2013 22:04 havdala370 (photo credit: Steve Linde) OSWIECIM, Poland – Michael Freund sat after Shabbat prayers in the 100-year-old Chevra Lomdei Mishnayot Synagogue in the small Polish town of Oswiecim, and told the 36 people in attendance his favorite hassidic story. “Someone once approached the great Kotzker Rebbe – Rabbi Menachem Mendel of Kotzk – and said to him, ‘Rebbe, you are known to be a great miracle- worker. So why don’t you revive the dead?’ The Rebbe thought for a moment and then responded: ‘You know what? If I wanted to, I could revive the dead. But I prefer to revive the living.’” That, said Freund, is the goal of the organization he founded and chairs, Shavei Israel: “To revive the living, to reach out to descendants of Jews and help them to return to their roots and reclaim their heritage.” Freund, together with Shavei Israel’s two charismatic emissaries in Poland – the Jerusalem-born Rabbi Boaz Pash and Kansas City-born Rabbi Yehoshua Ellis – had gathered mostly young people from all over Poland exploring their Jewish roots for a Shabbaton in the synagogue located on the other side of the Sola River from the Auschwitz death camp. The group included a 20- year-old student whose grandmother had informed her family on Christmas eve before she died that they were all in fact Jewish. Freund helped him lay tefillin for the first time. Another young man who related how his family had been hidden during the Holocaust by a Polish family. A woman recalled discovering that her family was Jewish by opening a chest filled with religious items that her mother had forbidden anyone to touch, and a brunette with two beautiful, blonde daughters. Another woman with two children, a boy aged 8 and a girl aged 10, found out through genealogical research that her paternal grandfather had been an SS officer who fled to Poland after the war while her maternal grandfather had been Jewish. There were a friendly family with Jewish roots undergoing an Orthodox conversion to Judaism and a young, secular Jewish doctor who came by train from a nearby town. And there was a 65-year-old retiree who drove us on Sunday to Auschwitz, where he broke down in tears and told us that at the age of 51, he had learned from his father that he was Jewish and that six of his father’s brothers had been murdered in the infamous death camp. Each person had an amazing story to tell, as we sat together for kosher meals organized by Shavei Israel, despite the difficulties facing the local Jewish community regarding ritual slaughter. They all exhibited an insatiable appetite to learn about Judaism and Israel. “Our aim is to underline the indestructibility of the Jewish spirit. By bringing these young people together to honor and explore their Jewish heritage, we are sending a message to the world that we are truly an eternal nation,” Freund says. “I can’t think of a better way to demonstrate that the Jewish people still live than by celebrating Shabbat with young Polish Jews in the shadow of the valley of death known as Auschwitz.” Asked why he chose to hold the Shabbaton so close to the site of the most infamous former death camp, Freund replies: “In this place, where Hitler and his henchmen so ruthlessly sought to erase all traces of Judaism, and nearly succeeded in doing so, we came together to show that Jewish life still endures. Stay updated with the latest news! Subscribe to The Jerusalem Post Newsletter Subscribe Now “Almost seven decades after the Holocaust, the best revenge is to revitalize Jewish life and to bring these young Poles with Jewish roots back to our people.” A young man from Netanya studying medicine in Poland (with 10 other Israelis) told me that he could not explain why, but there seemed to be “a real Jewish revival” in the country. Various estimates put the number of Jews in Poland at between 4,000 and 5,000, but he believes there are many more who keep their Jewish identity a secret. Freund agrees. “In recent years, a growing number of young Poles have begun to discover their Jewish roots,” he says. “Against all odds, the ‘hidden Jews’ of Poland are emerging, seeking to reconnect with the Jewish people. I believe that we have a historical, moral and religious responsibility to reach out to them, embrace them and welcome them back home. That is what their forefathers would have wanted, and we owe it to them to try.” What motivates Freund, who made aliya from New York and lives in Ra’anana with his family? “My late grandmother’s first cousin, Isaac Kottler, and his wife, Anna, were rounded up by the French collaborationist police in Paris in the summer of 1942 and held in the Drancy detention camp before being deported on September 2, 1942, on Transport 27 to Auschwitz, where they were murdered by the Germans,” he says. “So I feel a very strong personal connection to the issue of reaching out to survivors of the Holocaust and their descendants.” On Sunday, as our group began a tour of Auschwitz, where some 1.1 million Jews were murdered, Freund went up to Chief of Staff Lt.-Gen. Benny Gantz – the son of a Holocaust survivor – who was concluding his visit ahead of the March of the Living which he led the next day. Freund shook Gantz’s hand, saying, “Thank God we have merited to live in a generation where the people of Israel have their own chief of staff.” The pre-Holocaust Jewish community of Oswiecim (which first settled there in the 16th century) called the town Oshpitzim, which means “guests” in Aramaic. The synagogue, built in 1913, was the only Jewish house of prayer not demolished by the Nazis. It was renovated together with a museum and education center, and the Auschwitz Jewish Center reopened to the public in September 2000 “to honor the former residents of the town and to teach future generations about the destruction caused by the Holocaust.” Before the Shoah began in 1939, more than half of the town’s 14,000 residents were Jewish – merchants, doctors, lawyers and rabbis – and in 1934, Dr. Emil Reich was elected deputy mayor. Shavei Israel (www.shavei.org) is the primary organization working in a concerted fashion to reach out to Poles with Jewish roots. It runs seminars and Shabbatonim throughout the year in Poland, publishes books about Jewish history and Judaism in Polish, distributes a weekly Parsha sheet in Polish via the Internet, organizes an annual threeweek summer program in Israel in Polish for young Poles, and assists those who wish to make aliya. For me, the most moving moment of the Shabbaton in Oswiecim was singing Am Yisrael Hai (The People of Israel Lives) together with Moshe Kusminsky, a musician and educator, and his wife, Tzivia, Argentinean olim who flew out from Israel especially for the weekend. We all joined in as Rabin Boaz (that’s what the community calls the beloved rabbi who has learned to speak fluent Polish), made the Havdala blessings while a young boy (whose mother told me was a math whizz kid) held up the twisted candle. After a week of snow, rain and freezing temperatures, the historic synagogue in the darkest of places was filled with warmth, light and laughter as we held hands and danced in a circle.

Election candidates have used overwhelming strategies to entice voters to vote for them. These include sending dinner invitations, coercing education institutes and making students attend their so called sessions. I find these tactics to be a tad disrespecting. These people are supposed to solve our issues. But they are busy making hollow promises and hurting the sentiments of striving engineers. No one has talked about pragmatically solving the problems that are being faced by both unemployed and newly graduated engineers. At this point, we can only hope that the best candidate wins.

The Hamburg-based paper quoted German Deputy Defense Minister Thomas Kossendey as saying in a letter to the parliamentary defense committee that such an arms export was possible even though German laws bar the sale of weapons to crisis regions. German arms sales more than doubled during the last five years, ranking the country behind just the US and Russia on the list of the world's largest weaponry exporters. Berlin has also massively stepped up weapon sales to the highly militarized Mideast region, especially Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. Human rights groups have lambasted the arms deals, citing major human rights deficits in these despotic countries.

The shocking thing is that such medicines have been declared harmful to health by a majority of doctors. In fact, the excessive use of such medicines has led to countless diseases, including high blood pressure, insomnia, and, kidney failure.

MOAB — The girlfriend of a Grand County man whose body was pulled from the Colorado River over the weekend is now the third person arrested in connection with his death. Corina ""Cori"" Yardley is also the mother of 16-year-old Brody Blu Kruckenberg, one of two teens charged as an adult with murder and obstruction of justice in the killing of Gregorio Salazar Campos. Yardley, 44, has been booked into the Grand County Jail for investigation of obstruction of justice, according to Grand County Chief Deputy Darrel Mecham. Tony went on to say that the person was an illegal, so no one will miss him. –Grand County Jail report Investigators first learned of Campos' death on Saturday — 13 days after he was last seen by a family member — when someone informed them Charles Anthony ""Tony"" Nelson, also 16, ""told a friend he had killed someone,"" a Grand County Jail report states. ""Tony went on to say that the person was an illegal, so no one will miss him,"" the report states. Investigators interviewed Nelson. They said the teen told them Kruckenberg called him on March 25, and informed him that Campos was asleep in his mother's bed and invited Nelson over. Nelson told detectives that Kruckenberg suggested that they kill Campos, but wouldn't shoot the man, the report states. ""Tony said it was not his deal, but was talked into doing it by his friend,"" officers wrote. Detectives say Nelson told them he pointed a gun through a crack in the bedroom door and fired a shot that struck Campos in the bottom of the jaw. ""The victim started to regurgitate and Tony shot him two more times,"" the report states. Corina ""Cori"" Yardley The second and third shots also struck Campos in the head, according to an autopsy. The teens then used Yardley's truck to drive Campos to the banks of the Colorado River, where they tied his body to a metal bumper and threw it in the water, jail records state. Investigators said the teens later led authorities to the site. Forensic tests conducted in Yardley's bedroom showed evidence of blood in a ""large area of the carpet and wall,"" according to police. Investigators said they also determined that the bed in Yardley's bedroom had been replaced five days after the shooting. Mecham declined to say Tuesday what role investigators believe Yardley played in Campos' death, the disposal of his body or the apparent effort to clean up the crime scene. ""All I'll say is she's involved,"" he said. Yardley is being held on a $10,000 cash-only bail. No formal charges have been filed against her and a date for her first court appearance has not been set. Kruckenberg and Nelson are both charged in 7th District Court with murder, a first-degree felony, and obstruction of justice, a second-degree felony. Their first court appearances are set for April 23. × Related stories Teens charged as adults in homicide of Moab man Most recent Utah stories Utah CEO, family social media influencer dies after 200-foot fall in Zion National Park Utah-based Beehive Meals lands among top 100 small business in US Boys & Girls Club working to fill child care gap, highlight need for investment Related topics Utah Geoff Liesik More stories you may be interested in Operation Underground Railroad founder sues 6 additional women for defamation Skating event will honor young man killed in Salt Lake City last year His final course design, Black Desert to serve as memory of the legacy of former pro Tom Weiskopf Most Viewed Theft victim accidentally helps crack large Layton theft case thanks to Apple AirTag 'The loudest building I've ever played in': Inside the memorable debut of the Utah Hockey Club Smoke spreads as Yellow Lake Fire reaches almost 20,000 acres Illinois man dies in Utah County paragliding accident Las Vegas says goodbye to the Tropicana with a flashy casino implosion Rain, tornadoes and tropical storm-force winds lash Florida as Hurricane Milton draws near Human skull found by antler hunter near Brigham City Colorado dismisses suit against baker who wouldn't make cake for transgender woman Missing Roosevelt woman found dead Officials identify man killed in Monday road rage confrontation KSL Weather Forecast        Mobile Apps | Newsletter | Advertise | Contact Us | Careers with KSL.com | Product Updates Terms of use | Privacy Statement | DMCA Notice | Manage My Cookies | EEO Public File Report | KSL-TV FCC Public File | KSL FM Radio FCC Public File | KSL AM Radio FCC Public File | Closed Captioning Assistance © 2024 KSL.com |  KSL Broadcasting  Salt Lake City UT   |  Site hosted & managed by Deseret Digital Media -  a Deseret Media Company",Girlfriend arrested in Moab man's death | KSL.com Utah Features Counties Idaho U.S. World Home Counties Police & Courts Business Politics Education Science Environment More Health Religion Traffic More Than a Flag Voces de Utah Coronavirus Girlfriend Arrested In Moab Man’s Death.

Video Ad Feedback Gunman opens fire in Italy 03:09 - Source: CNN Story highlights NEW: U.S. sends congratulations to new prime minister Gunman hoped to kill himself but ran out of ammunition, official says Two police officers suffered non-life-threatening wounds Enrico Letta was being sworn in as prime minister at nearby president's palace CNN — Two national police officers were wounded Sunday when a gunman shot at officers outside the Italian prime minister’s office, authorities said. The gunman, described as a 49-year-old man, fired six shots at police before being taken into custody, said a national police officer who was not authorized to speak to the media. The officers didn’t suffer life-threatening wounds, and the shooter was also hospitalized – though not wounded, the source said. Francesco Puglisi, a journalist for Il Tempo newspaper, heard the shots from his office, then saw police tackle the man. He ran to the scene and said the face-down suspect appeared calm and was complying with police. The gunman wanted to commit suicide after the attack but ran out of bullets, Italian Interior Minister Angelino Alfano said in a televised statement. The shooting took place in front of the prime minister’s office, but Enrico Letta was being sworn in as prime minister at the time at the president’s palace a short distance away, state-run news agency ANSA said. The agency also reported that prosecutor Pierfilippo Laviani said the shooter had confessed and was hoping to shoot politicians but found none so he struck out at police. Security at key government buildings was strengthened after the attack, though officials said they thought it was an isolated incident. The shooter, who is unemployed, lives in the southern region of Calabria, officials said. On Saturday, Letta, a center-left politician, accepted a mandate to form a government from President Giorgio Napolitano. The 46-year-old former deputy prime minister and his ministers were sworn in Sunday, and parliament is expected to confirm his government through a vote of confidence Monday. Letta’s acceptance of the leadership role is expected to limit the uncertainty that has gripped the nation since February when elections left none of the candidates with enough support to form a government. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry called Letta a trusted friend of Washington. “We wish him the best as he promotes reform at home and ensures continued Italian leadership abroad, and we look forward to continuing our close cooperation with Italy on many pressing issues all over the world,” Kerry said.

Matters YOU US TNS Opinion Unrealistic commitments By Mohammad Zubair March 17, 2020 In an interview to a private television channel recently, Minister for Planning Asad Umar said that the promise to provide one crore jobs still holds true – even though none will be provided in the first two years of the government. According to the senior PTI leader, the economic plan unleashed before the elections talked of promises over a five-year period. As such, the PTI still remains committed to one crore jobs in its five-year term. Fair enough but this does raise some fundamental questions. With one third of the term already gone, is suggestion that 3.3 million jobs will be created every year over the next three years ? Also consider that approximately 2.5 million Pakistanis will have lost their jobs between August 2018 to July 2020. So technically the government will need to create not just 10 million jobs but 12.5 million jobs over the last three years of its term. That’s more than four million jobs per year for three consecutive years. The re-commitment at this stage seems even more unrealistic than the original commitment of one crore jobs. When the plan was announced in July 2018, the economic conditions were far better than where we are today. The economy had been growing at reasonable growth rates closing at 5.8 percent at the end of fiscal 2018 and was projected to grow over six percent in fiscal year 2019. In spite of the healthy state of economy then and the projected growth in the following year, it still did not make any sense to promise one crore jobs over the following 5 years. However, with the PTI taking over, the economic conditions started to deteriorate with the growth rate plummeting from 5.8 percent to around three percent – rather than going up over six percent as was projected. This year, the growth rate is expected to go down further to around 2.4 percent. With plummeting growth rates, we could only expect massive job cuts; which has been the case so far. If we are to accept that the government’s commitments need to be assessed over the five-year period, we would then assume that they are also committed in providing 50 lakh housing units. Again with one third of the term already gone, we would assume that in the remaining 41 months, 50 lakh units will be built – assuming the process starts immediately. That’s obviously not possible considering there is no concrete infrastructure, no financing model yet, no legal framework and not even the team to support the gigantic task. Let’s assume the entire framework is ready in the next six months (almost an impossibility). That will leave around 35 months in which to construct five million housing units. This comes to around 150,000 housing units every single month. Not even a diehard PTI supporter can bet on such a figure. It will be incredible even if the government is able to construct one lakh housing units by the end of its tenure. Does the government even understand the magnitude of the task ahead? Is the comprehension of the economic challenges properly understood? Preparing an unrealistic economic plan was bad enough but recommitting the delivery after 19 months of dismal performance is even worse. And this brings us to the main concern about the government. They need to understand that employment opportunities are created as a result of sustained economic activity. And sustained economic activity is a consequence of significant investment and a positive economic environment – both factors missing since August 2018. Also, economic growth has to far exceed the population growth rate to ensure additional job opportunities. With the kind of population growth in Pakistan, the economy must grow in excess of six percent in order to create approximately 15 lakh or more jobs per annum. That kind of economic growth is not happening in the next two fiscal years. In fact the projections remain abysmally poor with growth projected around three percent. Rather than the employment opportunities, such dismal economic growths would possibly end up with far more job losses as has been the case over the last 19 months. Contrary to reality, the PM has been made to believe that 2020 will be the year of economic growth that will enable job creation on a large scale. Accordingly, the PM has been going around the country and sharing his thoughts. Like the economic promises that he was made to commit to before the elections, this time around as well, he will be made to regret the commitments and then the famous U-turns. But this will be far more embarrassing than the pre-election promises. Not that there is any justification for not keeping the pre-election promises but having learnt the limitations during the last 19 months, it is no good to make false promises at this stage. It’s not just about one crore jobs and 50 lakh housing units. There were promises in every sector – education, health, dams, public transport, agriculture, industry, services, public sector enterprises, railways, FBR, power distribution companies and several others. We have seen no progress in any of the above sectors and it seems the government has already given up within the first 19 months. The above sectors are important but none compared to the promise to provide one crore jobs and building 50 lakh housing units. The PTI won the elections on such slogans but in the process betrayed the trust reposed by the people of Pakistan. As a minimum, it must stop re-committing the promise to provide one crore jobs and 50 lakh houses. The writer is former governor Sindh and former minister for privatisation.

Share UNHCR Opposes Forcible Return of CAR Refugees share Print GENEVA — The UN refugee agency is urging governments around the world against forcibly returning refugees to the Central African Republic. The UNHCR warned the situation in the CAR is still too dangerous for refugees to return home safely. The agency said the situation in the Central African Republic has worsened since rebel Seleka forces launched a series of attacks against the government of former President Francois Bozize in December. UNHCR spokesman, Adrian Edwards, said the situation has become even more chaotic since the rebels seized the capital, Bangui, in March. ""In the wake of the offensive, targeted killings, arbitrary arrests and detention, torture and recruitment of children have been widely reported. Rape, disappearances, kidnappings, as well as extortion and looting in Bangui and other parts of the country are also reported,"" he said. ""Humanitarian access to the people affected remains severely restricted."" For all these reasons, Edwards said the UNHCR is advising governments worldwide to refrain from forcibly deporting refugees to the CAR. The UNHCR reports violence has displaced some 173,000 people inside the CAR and prompted almost 50,000 people to flee to neighboring countries in recent months. Most of them have fled to the Democratic Republic of Congo, Chad and Cameroon. Edwards called the current situation in the CAR fluid and dangerous. He said the wide prevalence of human rights violations and the grave and deteriorating humanitarian situation in the country is causing untold suffering among the population. He said states have a responsibility to see to it that asylum remains civilian in nature and that refugee status is not granted to people who may be responsible for abusive and violent acts. ""And, for this reason, we are recommending that states exert caution to identify combatants and separate them from the refugee population. The advisory also stresses that exclusion from refugee status may need to be looked into for some individuals, beyond those who are combatants,"" he added. ""This would apply, for example, to people who may have been involved in war crimes and crimes against humanity."" The UNHCR is urging countries to protect those seeking refuge and to maintain humanitarian and asylum principles until conditions in the CAR allow people to return home in safety and dignity.

Bush won't be joining the ranks of Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter by throwing his support behind marriage equality now that he is safely out of the White House. He is, as ever, his same-old, constitutional-amendment-against-same-sex-marriage-supporting self -- nude self-portraits and image rehab efforts be damned. In an interview with Charlie Rose on CBS News, Bush said that he wouldn't comment on same-sex marriage (after happily commenting on national security and immigration reform, it is worth noting): “Yeah, well, I’m not, I’m not weighing in on these issues, as you know, because I’ve made the decision to get off the stage.

The pan-Caribbean awards panel, convened at the third International Congress of Caribbean Writers held in French-speaking Guadeloupe earlier this month, awarded Danticat its literary prize. The literary luminaries on the panel included Roger Toumson, President of the Association of Caribbean Writers, and Ernest PÃ©pin both of Guadeloupe; Alexandre Alaric of Martinique, Elisabeth Wilson of Jamaica, Chiqui Vicioso of the Dominican Republic, Dominique Battraville of Haiti, and Emilio Jorge Rodriguez of Cuba. According to Toumson, chair of the panel, ""Create Dangerously"" is an extraordinary book that confirms the quality of the novelist: ""The art of the description, the narrative that she displays in her work provides a sublime report of her journey back to her native land that has suffered from a terrible earthquake, which has marked her deeply."" She not only expresses her emotions and thoughts that she witnessed, he added, but she also questions her responsibilities as a writer and artist. ""At the same time, she has been able to describe the enigmatic beauty of Hatian paintings, which according to her, contain the secrets of a capacity to rebound in life, to resist misfortunes,"" he observed. Toumson added that Haitian literature makes an important contribution to the wealth of world heritage and provided hope to all people. Special mentions were also extended to two authors for their work written in English and Spanish respectively: ""Light Falling on Bamboo"" by Lawrence Scott of Trinidad and Tobago, and ""NÃ©cropolis"" by Santiago Gamboa of Colombia. The Regional Council of Guadeloupe expressed gratitude to all participants and supporters of the congress which has become an important event on the region's cultural calendar. © Copyright 2013 by thebahamasweekly.com Top of Page News Feed Receive our Top Stories Preview | Powered by CommandBlast Caribbean News Latest Headlines Jamaicaâs agro-processing sector being enhanced by joint CDB, EU, JBDC project Africa in My Skin by Dominican Republic poet Rafael Nino FÃ©liz, published as trilingual edition Pandemic is pushing Latin America and the Caribbean more off track in ending child labour CDEMA and CDB partner to enhance Emergency Data Collection Capacity in the Caribbean CROSQ Supporting the Sustainable Development Goals through Accreditation",thebahamasweekly.com -  Caribbean Writers Honours Haitian-American Author.

        11:23 AM EDT, Thu May 2, 2013 Link Copied! Video Ad Feedback Pentagon plans military options on Syria 02:28 - Source: CNN Read a version of this story in Arabic. Washington CNN — All options remain on the table as the Obama administration considers what, if any, military action to take in Syria following the suspected use of chemical weapons there, U.S. officials tell CNN. They say this includes the possibility of providing arms to rebels even though the administration has opposed this step and several caution that its resistance to doing so is unlikely to change. So far, the United States has provided communications and other non-lethal aid to the rebels fighting the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in a two-year civil war. The administration recently announced that it would double that commitment to $250 million worth of assistance. pkg pleitgen syria violence_00014212.jpg video Related video Damascus bombing spurs anger at U.S. pkg damon iraq violence_00005623.jpg video Related video Syrian civil war stokes violence in Iraq exp syria.slaughter.amanpour_00014610.jpg video Related video How red must the red line be in Syria? Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images video Related video Obama clarifies 'game changer' comments A final decision on the composition of the boosted aid will be made after consultation with military commanders, National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said. Communications equipment, armor, night vision goggles, and vehicles are among items being discussed, Hayden said. Hezbollah warns it will get more involved in Syria if foreign threats jeopardize regime “As the President has said, our assistance to the Syrian opposition has been on an upward trajectory, and he has directed his national security team to identify additional measures so that we can continue to increase our assistance,”she said. “We continue to consider all other possible options that would accomplish our objective of hastening a political transition, but have no new announcements at this time.” But the Washington Post reported on Tuesday that Obama is preparing to send “lethal weaponry” to the opposition. But officials also emphasized in the report that supplying arms is one of several options under consideration. The Post said Obama would likely make a final decision on arms in coming weeks. Obama said at a news conference on Tuesday that the United States would wait until it has more details on evidence of chemical weapons use in Syria before making any decision on whether to alter strategy. Obama previously called the use of chemical agents a “red line” for America. What that ultimately means has been an open question since the administration disclosed last week that intelligence had concluded “with varying degrees of confidence” those arms had been used in small amounts. The United States doesn’t yet know “how they were used, when they were used, who used them,” Obama said. “When I am making decisions about American national security and the potential for taking additional action in response to chemical weapons use, I have to make sure I have the facts.” Syria denies that it has used, or even possesses, chemical weapons. Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey told a Christian Science Monitor luncheon on Tuesday that the military continues to plan and develop options. “We are looking to determine whether these options remain valid as conditions change,” he said. “Now that doesn’t mean that what we’ve heard over the last week ago wouldn’t change the policy calculus – both in this capital and others. But militarily, our task has been to continue to plan, to continue to engage with partners in the region and to continue to refine options so that if we’re asked to implement any of them we’ll be ready to do that,” he said. But a senior U.S. official highly involved on Syria said the administration is “always planning and there is stepped up planning as a result of all this (chemical weapons) stuff.” “Aggressive leadership, yes. That means haranguing the opposition until they are blue in the face and talking to the Arabs and others, like we have been doing,” the official said. “But there is no talk of arms and I would be stunned if we ever go down that route.” But another senior U.S. official, who is directly involved in military planning, said the issue of lethal aid remains on the table as a possible policy option just like everything else, but there is no indication that has accelerated in recent days for a possible policy change. That official said concerns involve an opposition in Syria that has grown more diverse, magnifying the question of where arms might ultimately wind up. New legal authorities would be required for arming rebels and allies in the region, like Jordan and Israel, are also nervous about increasing the flow of weapons already coming from Gulf States, the official said. CNN’s Jessica Yellin, Elise Labott, Barbara Starr and Jill Dougherty contributed to this report.

"Bridge plan receives EIA approval - Taipei Times Front Page Taiwan News Business Editorial & Opinion Sports World News Features Bilingual Pages Search Search All Front Page Taiwan News Business Editorial & Opinion Sports World News Features Bilingual Pages GO Home Taiwan News Thu, Apr 25, 2013 page3 Bridge plan receives EIA approval By Lee I-chia  /  Staff reporter An analysis report on the environmental impact of the amended construction plan for the Tamkang Bridge (淡江大橋) gained approval from an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) meeting yesterday. Before the meeting at the Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) yesterday morning, dozens of supporters led by city councilors and borough heads, as well as about a dozen opposing representatives from civic groups, gathered in front of the building to express their opinions. Green Citizens’ Action Alliance secretary-general Tsuei Su-hsin (崔愫欣) said that although the original plan for the construction of the bridge was passed 13 years ago, the local environment has changed since then. Civic groups protest in front of the Environmental Protection Administration yesterday to show their opposition to the construction of a bridge between Tamsui and Bali districts in New Taipei City, claiming that the bridge would affect the beautiful scenery. Photo: CNA A new construction application should be sent to an EIA meeting as a report on the change in environmental impact of the construction would not be enough, Tsuei said. “Most visitors go to Tamsui (淡水) for its beautiful natural scenery near the mouth of the river and the sunset on the ocean,” she said. “However, if the area is made into a special casino area or bustling business district, filled with concrete structures, the natural scenery that attracts tourists would be damaged.” Pan Han-shen (潘翰聲) of the Green Party Taiwan said that civic groups sought to protect a Shihsanhang excavation site from being destroyed by a construction project in the area about 20 years ago and the proposed construction plan would threaten the area’s cultural heritage. The groups also said that the sunset at Tamsui had been listed as one of the nation’s eight most beautiful natural sights, while the Shihsanhang excavation site and the Watzuwei (挖子尾) wetland reserve are both important cultural and natural heritage, and should not be damaged by the construction of the bridge. However, Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT) Legislator Wu Yu-sheng (吳育昇) said the majority of local residents, no matter their political stance, wished to see the bridge built. The bridge could link up various tourism resources in northern Taiwan, so locals wished that the EIA committee members could make professional suggestions on building the bridge, while reducing its environmental impact to a minimum, Wu said. Several borough heads said traffic congestion in the area is a big problem and residents feel the new bridge could help ease the problem. The committee asked the developer to make a few revisions, and approved the plan. The final report is to be presented to the EIA general assembly for a final decision.

China in May launched “punishment” drills around Taiwan shortly after Lai’s inauguration, in what Beijing said was a response to “separatist acts,” sending heavily armed warplanes and staging mock attacks as state media denounced newly inaugurated Lai.
The May drills were dubbed “Joint Sword — 2024A” and drew concerns from capitals, including Washington.

The patch was designed last year by Taiwanese designer Hsu Fu-yu (徐福佑), who said that it was inspired by Taiwan’s countermeasures against frequent Chinese military aircraft incursions.

Taiwan's GDP per capita was US$76,860, which put it at No. 14 on the list of the World's 100 Richest Countries this year, one spot above Hong Kong with US$75,130.

If fully implemented, it would ensure the lender's solvency and prevent it from being nationalized. https://p.dw.com/p/18LQO Image: Reuters Advertisement Piraeus Bank of Greece reported on Tuesday that its shareholders had approved a recapitalization deal with a view to safeguarding the financial institution's solvency. The second-biggest lender in the southern European nation said it was confident it would raise enough money through private sources to avoid being nationalized. It added the adopted plan was worth a total of 7.33 billion euros ($9.56 billion) in shares for private investors. Under the terms of the country's bailout by international lenders, Greek banks have to raise 10 percent of their total recapitalization needs privately or accept coming under state control. Keeping afloat Piraeus Bank Chairman Michael Sallas said a large part of the funds needed had already been pledged. ""My feeling is that we'll succeed,"" he commented, adding that investors abroad had also voiced interest. The fresh money coming from the sale of shares will go towards consolidating the lender's capital stock after massive write-downs on sovereign bonds and toxic loans. By contrast, the fourth-biggest lender in Greece, Eurobank, was not able to raise enough private funds for recapitalization. It turned to the domestic stability fund HFSF to get nationalized temporarily. Originally, Eurobank was to merge with the country's National Bank, but international lenders had voiced their misgivings about such a deal. hg/jr (AP, Reuters) Send us your feedback Your feedback Advertisement Skip next section Explore more Explore more Stuck in stagnation Stuck in stagnation The global economy has embarked on a path of slow recovery, but in Europe the end of the protracted crisis is not yet in sight.

Briefing the media at the Botswana Training Authority head offices this week, Joseph Lisindi said for a long time Botswana has been faced with a crisis of having mismatched graduates output within the industry. He explained that the quality of education has declined because of that. ""Responding to such a crisis demands a commitment from the whole nation to run with this new national contextualised framework. Anyone who will be provided with the education within this framework will be of relevance to the market,"" Lisindi said. He further explained that the National Human Resources Development Strategy (NHRDS) is aimed at emphasising the needs of a skilled human resource in the country, symbolising that key drivers of any nation's economy are it's people. ""We all know that diamonds are not forever. The key of Botswana's future is its people and not the mineral resources,"" Lisindi said. Already have an active account? Log in here .

Hundreds of Brits head to the Nurburgring in Germany each week to test their skills on the 12.9 mile racetrack. But those who made the 800-mile plus round trip to the track on Sunday were left waiting after a juvenile yet admittedly hilarious group painted the epic phallus on the course. Admit you laughed: Unidentified vandals painted an enormous penis onto the iconic Nurburgring racetrack in Germany Fearing the humungous appendage could distract drivers, a specialist team was called into paint over it Officials feared the 'artwork' could put the high-speed motorists off their game so a specialist team spent 90 minutes treating the graffiti before re-opening the track to the public. Sam Preston, from Bristol, made the trip to the course on Sunday when the incident happened. RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 2 Next Would you like meat and two veg with that? Pensioner finds...

Drivers waiting to use the track thought the graffiti was amusing. The officials did not see it the same way Sam Preston from Bristol said: 'About halfway around the track we found a group of track marshals and police gathered around this huge white graffiti penis' 'At around 11am the barriers were still not opening, so we decided to see if we could find the cause of the continued closure. 'About halfway around the track we found a group of track marshals and police gathered around this huge white graffiti penis. 'The officials didn't seem to find it as humourous as the bystanders - and swiftly called for a paint removal machine to be brought to the scene.' Motorists pay £17 to drive a lap of the track, which was recently put up for sale for around £81million.

He’s David Bakhtiari from Colorado. Bakhtiari is 6-4, 299 and played left tackle for the Buffaloes. He came out after his junior season and was a second-team All-Pac-12 selection in 2012, despite Colorado’s dismal record. This is a developmental guy, but one with the potential to become a starter in a year or two, either at left or right tackle or left guard. Bakhtiari has been described as nasty and we know that’s the kind of guy the Packers want to add to their offensive line. He’s quick and physical. The knock on Bakhtiari is that he doesn’t block well on the move and there are questions about whether he can handle elite edge rushers in the NFL. Bakhtiari ran the 40 in 5.02, registered a 25.5 vertical and had 28 reps in the bench. He was projected by some to be a second or third-round pick, so this pick provides some value to the Packers in the fourth. That apparent slide appears to have motivated Bakhtiari as well. That’s probably good news for the Packers.

He was a three yr started at T for Colorado. But they think he might be better suited in the pros for G or C. That just about covers all bases. Depth TyKoSteamboat says: 11 years ago We are aiming for that high-octane offense. We missed on Schwenke & passed on Jesse Williams & got another awesome RB in Jonathan Franklin. Very suprising. vijay says: 11 years ago @DBak59 4 Apr @ebak92 @JRodgers11 @BigJoeFauria standard Thursday night dinna with the fam n a classic movie.Umm yes#PitchPerfect pic.twitter.com/ImSccpleRX It would appear that Bakhtiari and younger Jordan Rodgers are already acquainted with each other…sign of things to come??? Lars says: 11 years ago I don’t know why people keep projecting Bakhtiari to C or G, he’s may end up at guard if he puts on about 10-15 pounds, but will get every opportunity to push Newhouse and the bust Sherrod off the roster. Tretter, on the other hand, I could see at C. On missing Schwenke, I would call it a pass. He was sitting there at the bottom of three for the taking and the Packers traded down. The Jesse Williams love affair was always mystifying and his 5th round pick status proves no team was fooled by the bench press, the hype or anything else. His injury didn’t help, but Williams is not a very good football player. Watch the film. Email Facebook Pinterest RSS Twitter Find It!

Matters YOU US TNS World Afghan women fear cost of peace will be freedom By AFP February 02, 2019 KABUL: It is naive to think the Taliban have changed their stance on women’s rights, says Kabul restaurateur Laila Haidari, who like many educated Afghan women fears any peace deal between the extremists and the US could erode hard-won freedoms. Draconian rules that once forced half the population behind closed doors -- barred from education and work -- have been chipped away in the nearly two decades since the US-led invasion that swept the Taliban from power. ""If they return, women will have to leave the public space,"" Haidari tells AFP from the restaurant she runs in Kabul, one of the few places in the capital where men and women dine together. Haidari launched the #metooafghanistan movement which she and others hope will be a vanguard of Afghan women who can hold the line against Taliban power. ""We never want to go back. We never want to lose our freedom,"" says Mina Rezaee, the owner of another cafe in Kabul, where music -- banned under the Taliban -- plays in the background. After six days of negotiations in Qatar, the US and Taliban have agreed a draft framework for a deal which could pave the way for the insurgents to hold peace talks with Kabul. With the US desperate to withdraw from Afghanistan, and the Taliban in control of vast parts of the country, it is unclear what a post-conflict government would look like. Any participation by the Taliban, however, frightens many women. Before being toppled by the US invasion of 2001, the Taliban governed Afghanistan for nearly five years with a strict interpretation of Shariah law. ""We still remember how hard it was to be a woman under Taliban rule,"" says Naweeda Bayat, a 25-year-old from central Jaghori district.""I was a kid, but I remember they burned our school right in front of our eyes."" The government in Kabul controls less than two-thirds of the country, according to a US estimate -- and in Taliban-controlled areas nothing has changed. ""They have either burned girls’ schools or don’t allow women to work,"" Bayat says. ""This tells us how they might be if they come back."" Afghan women have even more reason to worry if they are ""shut out of the negotiation process, as they mostly have been,"" says Heather Barr, a senior women’s rights researcher. ""The Taliban’s attitude toward women has moderated slightly since 2001, but it is still a million miles away from the equal rights women are granted under Afghanistan’s constitution,"" she observes. The Taliban vowed Friday to pursue ""the establishment of an Islamic system"" in the country as talks continue, saying the group did not oppose education for women, according to the insurgency’s spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid.However, Mujahid remained vague on what an Islamic system would mean for the rights of Afghan women.

Billabong International is trying to avoid a total wipeout. The Australian surfwear company, whose shares have fallen around 65 percent since it rejected a $824 million takeover offer from the private equity firm TPG Capital last year, said on Tuesday that it was in talks to sell itself for $300 million. Billabong said the discussions were with a group led by Paul Naude, the former head of its American operations, and the buyout firm Sycamore Partners Management, and would last for 10 days. The consortium has offered to buy the struggling retailer for 60 Australian cents a share (about 63 American cents), an 18 percent discount on Billabong’s closing share price on April 2 before the stock was suspended. Billabong has fallen on difficult times because of changing consumer tastes and the financial crisis. It has closed stores and sold assets as part of an effort to restructure the company.

"China Leads World in Cyber Espionage, says Report Subscribe Now ! My Account Sign In Sign Out Home :: Security :: Library :: News :: 2013 :: April :: Military WMD Intelligence Security Menu Systems Industry Operations Hot Documents News Reports Policy Budget Congress Links Space Homeland Security China Leads World in Cyber Espionage, says Report by Matthew Hilburn April 24, 2013 China leads the world in computer espionage, according to an annual report that monitors the state of global cyber threats. Ninety-six percent of cyber espionage cases targeting intellectual property and business trade secrets were attributed to ""threat actors in China,"" while the remaining four percent were unknown, according to the ""2013 Data Breach Investigations Report,' which is issued by Verizon, a large U.S. telecom firm. ""This may mean that other threat groups perform their activities with greater stealth and subterfuge,"" read the report. ""But it could also mean that China is, in fact, the most active source of national and industrial espionage in the world today."" While the numbers certainly seem clear, some security experts caution not to draw too many conclusions from the report. ""Verizon doesn't explain how they determine that an event is state-sponsored, nor how they distinguish between legitimate attacks originating from China and those which use compromised servers in Chinese IP space,"" said Jeffrey Carr, CEO of Taia Group, a cyber-security firm. ""Hence, any conclusion that they try to draw about the government of China has to be taken with a great degree of skepticism."" Carr said he believes a lot of the espionage originating in China could ""actually be the work of non-state actors working in the Chinese IP space."" However, he said he welcomed recent discussions between the U.S. and Chinese official to collaborate on dealing with cyber attacks. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Martin Dempsey, discussed cybersecurity with his Chinese counterpart, Fang Fenghui, during his visit to China this week. Earlier this month, Secretary of State John Kerry also discussed the topic with Chinese leaders during a visit to Beijing. Banks and other financial institutions remain the most targeted among hackers, according to Verizon, but manufacturing companies, transportation organizations and utility companies were also targeted. Verizon's data was compiled from numerous sources, including U.S. and foreign incident response teams and companies that have engaged Verizon to perform cyber work.

French Col. Cyrille Zimmer said on Sunday that around 100 soldiers have been relocated to the northeastern town of Gao. He added that a small detachment of 20 troops would remain in Timbuktu who would “operate with the Burkinabe battalion.” Soldiers from Burkina Faso officially took over in the northern town last week. ""This detachment is going to stay in Timbuktu while the Burkinabes are there,"" he added. Meanwhile, French Defense Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian on Friday reaffirmed that the country would keep 1,000 troops in Mali to fight armed groups even after the arrival of UN peacekeepers later this year. “From now on we are in the post-war phase. The UN resolution adopted yesterday will allow for the arrival of a force to stabilize the country,” Le Drian told reporters, adding, “But France will keep about 1,000 soldiers to carry on with military operations.” The French-led war on Mali, which Paris launched on January 11, has caused a serious humanitarian crisis in the northern areas of the country and has displaced thousands of people, who now live in deplorable conditions. Amnesty International said on February 1 that serious human rights breaches -including the killing of children- were being conducted in Mali. Some political analysts believe Mali's abundant natural resources, including gold and uranium reserves, could be one of the reasons behind the French war against the African country.

Matters YOU US TNS National Eight killed in Philippines By AFP February 03, 2019 MANILA: A ""fierce firefight"" on Saturday killed five Philippine soldiers and three militants suspected of this week’s deadly cathedral bombing in the nation’s restive south, the military said. The soldiers battled the Abu Sayyaf militants on the southern island of Jolo, which is the group’s stronghold as well as the site of dual bomb attack on January 27 that killed 21 people at Sunday mass. After the cathedral bombing, President Rodrigo Duterte singled out the kidnap-for-ransom group -- which has previously been blamed for some of the Philippines’ deadliest attacks -- and ordered the military to ""crush"" them. ""It was a fierce firefight"", regional military spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Gerry Besana told AFP, confirming the death toll. ""It went on for nearly two hours."" Philippine officials have theorised in public that the cathedral attack was the work of at least one suicide bomber, but have also conceded they have not been able to confirm their suspicion.

""We were approached and asked if we would like to meet officials from government. But we would like to discuss only with the Chief Minister, as he alone can help us,"" Patel said.

LBT has to be paid by consumers not the traders. But, some items have been excluded,"" he said, adding that it will be phased out once the Goods and Services Tax comes. On April 24, traders plan to hold a car rally from central Mumbai's Shivaji Park to Azad Maidan while for April 26 they have planned a bigger march, having representatives traders from across the state. LBT was imposed from April 1 this year in Kolhapur, Pimpri-Chinchwad, Solapur, Vasai-Virar municipal areas. It will come into effect in Mumbai from October 1.

Kala Khan advocate, a resident of Kaag village, told this scribe that Chappar Bridge collapsed three months ago, cutting off hundreds of villages from the main city, but their demand for an alternative route was not fulfilled despite repeated demands. He said that the bridge collapse had caused immense problems for the commuters, especially for the office going community. He added that after the collapse of the bridge, the traffic had been diverted to a causeway, which could not bear the bulk of traffic and causes hours long congestion.

"Aung San Suu Kyi ineligible for presidential run in Myanmar - UPI.com Top News U.S. News World News Featured Odd News Entertainment Movies Music TV Science Health Sports NFL MLB NBA Soccer Voices Photos News US News World News Entertainment Sports Archive Almanac Advertisement Special Reports April 26, 2013 / 12:10 PM Suu Kyi won't be president, ruling party says NAYPYITAW, Myanmar, April 26 (UPI) -- There are no plans to amend the constitution in Myanmar so pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi can run for president, a leader said. Suu Kyi was freed from house arrest in 2010 and holds a seat in Myanmar's Parliament, a position she secured in elections in 2012. She won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991 for her pro-democracy campaign. Advertisement Myanmar President Thein Sein was recognized by the International Crisis Group this week for political reform efforts that coincided by Suu Kyi's release. Htay Oo, vice chairman of the ruling Union Solidarity and Development Party, said there are no plans to make way for a Suu Kyi presidential bid. ""Our party has not considered yet to review the constitution,"" he told Thai newspaper The Irrawaddy. Suu Kyi is prohibited from running for president because the law forbids candidates with foreign children. She has two children from her marriage to Michael Aris, a British national. Win Tin, a member of her opposition National League for Democracy, said she'd face an uphill battle for the presidency even with a legal maneuver.

""I just think it's fun,"" said the eighth-grader, who missed two days of school to volunteer. Samuelson's house is protected from Sheyenne River flooding thanks to a permanent diversion channel.

While the rising Red River will make history for latest crest, the official crest forecast for the Red at Fargo-Moorhead is 34 feet — quite a bit lower than previous forecasts which had prompted flood fighters to stockpile 1.7 million sandbags. More than 8,350 volunteers put in 43,971 hours over 16 days at Fargo's Sandbag Central to churn out those sandbags.  Photographer Ann Arbor Miller asked volunteers working at Sandbag Central last week for their insight on flood season. Volunteers wrote their thoughts on an empty sandbag with a black marker.

Ask him about the flood and he'll tell you what he tells everyone, ""Have a happy flood.""

Ann Arbor Miller for MPR 1 of 11 Dwight Nettleton, 55, of Fargo, N.D., is a longtime Fargo resident and a dedicated Sandbag Central volunteer. During the 2011 flood event, Nettleton volunteered for 23 days. This year he was putting in eight- to nine-hour days, and had 12 days under his belt as of April 23, 2013. ""It makes you feel good,"" he said. Ann Arbor Miller for MPR 2 of 11 Ask Kay Braun how many days she has put in volunteering during the 2013 flood event and she says she simply doesn't know.

Japan's All Nippon Airways will conduct around 230 test flights before allowing passengers on board [Reuters] Published On 27 Apr 2013 27 Apr 2013 Ethiopian Airlines became the world’s first carrier to resume flying Boeing’s Dreamliner, after the aircraft was grounded for nearly three months due to lithium-ion battery problems. The flight, to neighbouring Kenya on Saturday, landed a day after Japanese and US authorities gave approval for flights to resume. The grounding came after a battery fire on a parked Japan Airlines 787 at Boston’s Logan International Airport and an incident in which battery smoke forced an emergency landing of an All Nippon Airways 787 in Japan. A test flight by All Nippon Airways (ANA) on Sunday will be the first of around 230 flights the airline has planned before allowing the jet to carry passengers. Ray Connor, chief executive of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, and Shinichoro Ito, chief executive of ANA Group, will be on board the test flight. ANA has yet to decide when commercial flights would restart, said Osamu Shinobe, president of ANA, but he reiterated the Dreamliner would remain a core part of its fleet strategy. “I believe that safety has been secured now, but only by flying the 787 smoothly will we be able to demonstrate its safety and reassure our passengers,” Hiroyuki Ito, ANA senior executive vice president, told reporters. Local rival Japan Airlines Co Ltd said it would start its own test programme from May with the aim of using the jets to carry passengers again from June. “We have had this trouble with the 787, but it is a great aircraft,” JAL President Yoshiharu Ueki told reporters. JAL has seven Dreamliner planes. Meeting safety standards Boeing Co. said on Saturday that it is ready to build seven 787 Dreamliners a month from mid-year and is still on course for 10 per month by the end of the year. ANA, which has 17 Dreamliner jets, has not said how much the grounding has cost the company, though it has said it was losing $868,300 in revenue per plane in the last two weeks of January. ANA will renew compensation talks with Boeing after it resumes commercial flights and is able to calculate total losses, the company said. In addition to the battery fix approved by US authorities, Japan’s Civil Aviation Bureau has requested airlines meet the country’s own safety standards when flying the 787, which include monitoring the battery current while the jet is in the air and checking used batteries. Teams of Boeing engineers began installing reinforced batteries on Dreamliners owned by ANA on Monday. The airline hopes to complete retrofitting its entire fleet by mid-May.

Human Rights Watch said at least 100 political prisoners remain detained, though 24 have been released.

There is the internet, and there are scholarly books, but when the answers you seek about events of years past are nowhere to be found, or not satisfactory, where do you go? To the National Archives of India . There are institutions, establishments and business enterprises which stump you by the sheer size and energy of their operations. These organizations may have a public face but very little is known about how they operate and what drives themâor what happens behind the scenes. TOI today begins a new biweekly series which will attempt to demystify their functioning and bring you closer to them. NEW DELHI: If you wish to study history at first hand, head for the National Archives of India on Janpath. Thatâs what popular historians like William Dalrymple do. Past the NAIâs wise, octogenarian walls (inaugurated in 1926) and arthritic index drawers lie volumes of declassified papers that provide an uncoloured view of events like the Partition and the Emergency. There are also personal letters that reveal the human side of national icons like M K Gandhi, B R Ambedkar and Rabindranath Tagore. Contrary to the general perception, the NAI is not a space for highbrow scholars alone. It started life in Kolkata as the â Imperial Record Department â in 1891 but has gradually assumed a more public role. Of late, people have been visiting it on personal quests. Natives of the erstwhile princely states seek to read documents of accession to the Union of India. Those who migrated from Bangladesh or Pakistan come looking for migration records of refugees. The records are also increasingly accessed by activists, geologists, scientists and playwrights working on historical themes. âTill the 1990s, the focus of research was on political history. Now, people ask for records of land acquisition, gender and child rights. The character of NAI as a public record repository is rapidly changing,â says Jaya Ravindran, assistant director of Archives. How does the countryâs largest repository of public records work? The first step is to select archival material. Every government department is supposed to inform the NAI about documents that cross 25 years of age. An NAI appraisal team then picks those that concern policy decisions or events of administrative and historical value. The documents are sent to NAI with five copies of a transfer list. The next step is preservation. Since old papers are usually infested, they are treated in a fumigation chamber on arrival. Then, NAI staff physically checks each page for other damage before beginning restoration work. Every document has to be chronologically placed in NAIâs repository , and this is a laborious task, next only to answering queries under the Right to Information Act. âWe are flooded with RTI queries at times but we also want people to know that Archives is eager to be very accessible to people. We want to make information available to them before they resort to RTI,â says another staff member. NAI has digitized most of its records and is currently in the process of microfilming them to extend their lives by a few hundred years. While there is a catalogue of all the records on NAIâs intranet, itâs not yet accessible on the internet . Dalrymple, who has researched at NAI for most of his books, says, âNothing is computerized at NAI. It is old fashioned with paper indexes that are less efficient and time consuming. It is also a little chaotic. But NAI has one of the most remarkable collections. It is also open to scholars for exceptionally long hours compared to the national archives of UK. Some of the staff is very helpful tooâ. Going beyond declassified papers, the archives also contain gems like the Gilgit manuscriptsâamongst the oldest in the worldrecords of the British Raj , Persian manuscripts like Razmnama (Mahabharat) etc. Mushirul Hasan, director of NAI, is excited about receiving one lakh Mughal-era official documents of the Inayat Jung collection. âWe got them from the Asiatic Society in Kolkata and they are some of the most important collections we have,â says Hasan, who is writing a book on political prisoners under the Raj by consulting records from that era. âNAI is like a place of pilgrimage, devotees have to come here for moksha,â he says.

"Man jailed for watching cartoon pixies have sex - UPI.com Top News U.S. News World News Featured Odd News Entertainment Movies Music TV Science Health Sports NFL MLB NBA Soccer Voices Photos News US News World News Entertainment Sports Archive Almanac Advertisement Blog April 22, 2013 / 12:07 PM Man jailed for watching cartoon pixies have sex By Kristen Butler, UPI.com Sign depicting a fairing with a warning that 'little folk' are about. (CC/Phil Champion/ Geograph Project ) Ronald Clark downloaded cartoon pornography three years ago, ultimately ending up in court in Auckland, New Zealand. He was jailed for three months for possessing objectionable material, and sparking debate as to what harm is caused by digitally created pornography. Clark's lawyer Roger Bowden described them as ""pixies and trolls"" that ""you knew at a glance weren't human,"" according to Fairfax NZ News . Although the characters were elves and pixies, they were also clearly young, which sparked concern the images were linked to child sexual abuse. Advertisement Anti-child pornography group ECPAT Child Alert director Alan Bell said the images were illegal because they encouraged people ""to migrate from there to the real thing."" Bell acknowledged that no child was harmed in the cartoons' production but ""it's all part of that spectrum."" Auckland University associate philosophy professor Tim Dare said ""the justifications for punishment are likely to be worries about the tendency of the images to promote harm to real people in the future, or a concern for what the interest in the images tells you about their ‘character'."" Clark has previous convictions for indecently assaulting a teenage boy and has been through rehabilitation programs. Clark admitted he was interested in the images but said it was for ""a bit of a laugh,"" and that he did not find them sexually arousing. Advertisement He says the videos came from an established tradition of Japanese manga and hentai (cartoon pornography), a large mainstream industry.

Written by Bermet Zhumakadyr kyzy Translations Read this post in Español , Français , Italiano , polski Posted 27 April 2013 17:11 GMT Amid vocal protests [ru] from the Kyrgyz Ministry of Culture, a local activist group, Bishkek Feminist Collective SQ, performed the play ‘ The Vagina Monologues ‘ in the capital of Kyrgyzstan in March and April. The play by American playwright and feminist Eve Ensler about female sexuality and experiences earned mixed reactions from the Bishkek audience. Politically, Kyrgyzstan is often seen as being more liberal than its Central Asian neighbors. So far it is the only country in Central Asia to have had a female president . It was also the first country in the region to stage ‘The Vagina Monologues’ in 2009. However, Kyrgyzstan is also the only country in the region where bride kidnapping is still widely practiced, a predominantly conservative society and for a long time part of the Soviet Union, a country where the catchphrase “ there is no sex in the USSR ” [ru] became a union-wide meme ( here a blogger explains the story behind the catchphrase). Thus, despite being staged in Bishkek for the third time, it is perhaps unsurprising that ‘The Vagina Monologues’ raised controversy. Staging ‘The Vagina Monologues’ in Bishkek, 2013. Image from the Bishkek Feminist Collective SQ Facebook page, used with permission. ‘Corrosion’ of morals? In early April, the Ministry of Culture recommended [ru] that the organizers discontinue staging the “controversial play” in Bishkek based on the concern that ‘The Vagina Monologues’ “features episodes that contribute to the corrosion of moral and ethical standards and national traditions of the peoples of Kyrgyzstan.” The ministry’s statement provoked both negative and positive comments in social media. Bektour Iskender, Kyrgyz journalist, commented [ru] on kloop.kg's Facebook plugin: Я, честно говоря, не хочу больше на свои налоги содержать это глупое министерство культуры. Honestly, I don’t want my taxes to be used for funding this stupid ministry of culture. The opposite opinion was expressed [ru] by another Facebook user, Nazgul Nuranova: Прошу госорганы полностью запретить эту пьесу! I request that the authorities ban the play completely! What's in the name? The play was staged in Bishkek as part of the V-Day campaign, a global effort to end violence against women and girls. Aikanysh Jeenbaeva, a co-founder of the Bishkek Feminist Collective SQ and one of the organizers of ‘The Vagina Monologues’ in the country, suspects that the ministry drew conclusions about the play based on its title. “I think none of them have actually seen the play and they’re just judging it by its name,” she said in a recent interview. Stuart Kahn, director of Freedom House in Kyrgyzstan, also suspects that the ministry drew conclusions about the play based on its title: [A]pparently just the title of The Vagina Monologues announcement, an episodic play about the feminine experience, has evoked negative and threatening response from Kyrgyzstan’s Ministry of Culture… [The monologues] are on topics such as love, violence and anatomy but is primarily about female empowerment and individuality. Kahn also emphasized the scope of domestic violence in Kyrgyzstan: Over 85% of households in Kyrgyzstan experience domestic violence and bride kidnapping and rape are increasingly being documented. Until recently, punishment for stealing a cow was greater than for stealing a woman, although prosecution is still more likely just in cases of cows.  Only through an open discussion on problems confronting any society can changes be made. But the play has been criticized for what some people believe is the lack of relevance to the experience of Kyrgyz women. In a detailed review of the performance, blogger Georgii Mamedov writes [ru]: Фактически, зритель, посетивший спектакль, осведомляется о фетишистских представлениях о своем влагалище белых американок среднего класса. Одна из них мечтает, что ее вагина будет носить бриллианты от Тиффани, другой на консультации у семейного психотерапевта рекомендуют брить вагину, чтобы удержать мужа, другая, бывшая успешная адвокатша, становится элитной проституткой, обслуживающей женщин. В своего рода кульминационном монологе – «Вагина в гневе» — героиня возмущается бумажными халатами и холодными инструментами гинекологических кабинетов. Интересно, какой процент кыргызстанских женщин вообще не охвачен гинекологическим медицинским обеспечением? Having attended the performance, the audience becomes aware of the fetishist attitudes of white middle-class American females. One of them dreams that her vagina would wear Tiffany diamonds; another one, during a visit to a family psychotherapist, is recommended to shave her vagina in order to keep her husband; the third woman, a former successful lawyer, becomes an elite prostitute for women. In what in many ways is the climax of the monologues – ‘My Angry Vagina’ – the speaker resents paper gowns and cold medical tools in the gynecologist’s office. I wonder what percentage of women in Kyrgyzstan have access to gynecological medical support at all. ‘The road to hell…’ The performance has also drawn harsh criticism from the infamously conservative member of the parliament Tursunbai Bakir uulu. Questioning the justification for the staging of the play in the country, the MP tweeted [ru] on April 9: @bakiruulu : […]Благими намерениями дорога в Ад вымощена! @bakiruulu : […]The road to hell is paved with good intentions. (NB: Bakir uulu’s initiatives, radical in their own way, have provided Global Voices Online with plenty of material since the current Kyrgyz parliament was formed in October 2012. See here , here , here , and here .) Responding to the MP's tweet, Altynai Amati wrote [ru] on April 9: @Altynai_Amati : @bakiruulu Вы бы пришли, послушали, а потом говорили про дорогу в ад;) @Altynai_Amati : @bakiruulu You should come to the play, listen [to what is being discussed], and then only talk about the road to hell;) But the pious deputy declined [ru] the invitation: @bakiruulu : @Altynai_Amati Да хранит Аллах всех нас от святотатства и грешных дел! Аамин! @bakiruulu : @Altynai_Amati: May Allah save us all from sacrilege and sin! Amen! A satire blog on the local news outlet Akipress pokes fun [ru] at those who demand that the play be banned: В [Кыргызстане] хотят запретить показывать еще один раз спектакль «Болтливая вагина». Взамен предлагают крутить дома сколько хочешь ХХХ -видео «Упрямый пенис», которое можно купить в любом ларьке за углом. Хулители спектакля объяснили, что вагина не для того создана, чтобы ею говорить о насилии, а для того, чтобы это насилие в ней осуществлять. In Kyrgyzstan, they want to ban the performance ‘Chatty Vagina’. Instead, they recommend watching over and over ‘Stubborn Penis’, an XXX video that can be bought on any street corner and played at home. Critics of the play explain that vagina was not created with the goal of talking about violence; the goal was to have violence inflicted on the vagina. All funds raised by staging ‘The Vagina Monologues’ went to benefit a crisis center that works with female victims of domestic and sexual violence and provides a shelter for them.

LONDON, ENGLAND - DECEMBER 20: Wikileaks founder Julian Assange speaks from the Ecuadorian Embassy on December 20, 2012 in London, England. Mr Assange has been living in the embassy since June 2012 in an attempt to avoid extradition to Sweden where he faces allegations of sexual assault. (Photo by Peter Macdiarmid/Getty Images) I had an opportunity to interview WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, where he has been granted political asylum since June 2012. Assange is wanted for questioning in Sweden over sex allegations, although he has never been charged. Assange believes that if sent to Sweden, he would be put into prison and then sent to the United States, where he is already being investigated for espionage for publishing hundreds of thousands of classified diplomatic and military memos on the WikiLeaks website.

Bush's new presidential library at Southern Methodist University in Texas has opened with great fanfare, including the attendance of President Obama and former presidents Carter, Bush Sr. and Clinton.

Advertisement A good place to start would be laying out the number of deaths caused by the invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan. At Wikileaks, we documented that from 2004-2009, the U.S. had records of over 100,000 individual deaths of Iraqis due to violence unleashed by that invasion, roughly 80 percent of them civilians. These are the recorded deaths, but many more died. And in Afghanistan, the U.S. recorded about 20,000 deaths from 2004-2010. These would be good facts to include in the presidential library. And perhaps the library could document how people around the world protested against the invasion of Iraq, including the historic February 15, 2003, mobilization of millions of people around the globe. Many people worked hard during the Bush years to protest the wars, but the Bush administration refused to listen. It was very demoralizing for people to think that their efforts were for naught. They should not be demoralized. I believe that the opposition to the Iraq war was very important, and that it actually altered the behavior of U.S. forces during the initial invasion of Iraq. Compare it to the 1991 Gulf War, when massive numbers of Iraqis, both soldiers and civilians, were killed. In the 2003 invasion there was a lot more concern about casualties. The protests rattled their cage. Advertisement We released a memo that showed that if the prospective military operation might kill over 30 people, it had to be approved all the way up the chain of command. So while the protests did not stop the war, they did have an impact on the way the war was initially conducted, and that's important. While George Bush is feted in Dallas, Bradley Manning languishes in jail. His trial will begin on June 2. Bradley already pleaded guilty in February to ten charges, including possessing classified information and transferring it to an unauthorized person. Those pleas alone could subject him to 20 years in prison. On top of that, the government has added espionage charges that could put him in prison for life. What do you think the trial will be like? It will be a show trial where the government tries to prove that by leaking the documents, Bradley ""aided and abetted the enemy"" or ""communicated with the enemy."" The government will bring in a member of the Navy Seal team that killed bin Laden to say that he found some of the leaked information in bin Laden's house. But it's ridiculous to use that as evidence that Bradley Manning ""aided the enemy."" Bin Laden could have gotten the material from the New York Times ! Bin Laden also had a Bob Woodword book, and no doubt had copies of articles from the New York Times . The government doesn't even claim that Bradley passed information directly to ""the enemy"" or that he had any intent to do so. But they are nonetheless making the absurd claim that merely informing the public about classified government activities makes someone a traitor because it ""indirectly informs the enemy."" Advertisement With that reasoning, since bin Laden recommended that Americans read Bob Woodward book Obama's War , should Woodward be charged with communicating with the enemy? Should the New York Times be accused of aiding the enemy if bin Laden possessed a copy of the newspaper that included the WikiLeaks material? What are some things that Bradley Manning supporters can do to help? They should pressure the media to speak out against the espionage charges. The Los Angeles Times put out a good editorial but other newspapers have been poor. A Wall Street Journal column by Gordon Crovitz said that Bradley should be tried for espionage, and that I should be charged with that as well because I'm a ""self-proclaimed enemy of the state."" If Manning is charged with espionage, this criminalizes national security reporting. Any leak of classified information to any media organization could be interpreted as an act of treason. People need to convince the media that it is clearly in their self-interest to take a principled stand. What are other ways people can help Bradley Manning's case? People could put pressure on Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch. These groups briefly protested the horrible conditions under which Bradley was detained when he was held in Quantico, but not the fact that he's being charged with crimes that could put him in prison for life. It's embarrassing that Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch -- Amnesty International headquartered in London and Human Rights Watch headquartered in New York -- have refused to refer to Bradley Manning as a political prisoner or a prisoner of conscience. Advertisement To name someone a political prisoner means that the case is political in nature. It can be that the prisoner committed a political act or was politically motivated or there was a politization of the legal investigation or the trial. Any one of these is sufficient, according to Amnesty's own definition, to name someone a political prisoner. But Bradley Manning's case fulfills all of these criteria. Despite this, Amnesty International has said that it's not going to make a decision until after the sentence. But what good is that? What is Amnesty's rationale for waiting? Their excuse is that they don't know what might come out in the trial and they want to be sure that Bradley released the information in a ""responsible manner.""

Bradley Manning is the most famous political prisoner the United States has. He has been detained without trial for over 1,000 days. Not even the U.S. government denies his alleged acts were political. Human Rights Watch doesn't refer to Bradley Manning as a political prisoner either. These groups should be pushed by the public to change their stand. And they should be boycotted if they continue to shirk acting in their own backyard. Advertisement Another way for people to support Bradley Manning is to attend his trial in Ft. Meade, Maryland, which begins on June 2, and the rally on June 1.

While some say having many presidential hopefuls is a sign of democracy, others take it to be a problem. Mohammad Reza Bahonar, Deputy Speaker of Iranian Parliament, who himself is among presidential hopefuls expressed his opinion on the issue in a press conference after talking about the weak and strong points of President Ahmadinejad's cabinet. Bahonar belongs to the largest Principlist coalition known as ""Coalition of Five"". Manouchehr Mottaki, Iran's former Foreign Minister also belongs to this coalition. ""Coalition of Three"" which is comprised of Tehran Mayor Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf, lawmaker Gholam Ali Haddad Adel, and Ali Akbar Velayati, a top advisor to the Leader of the Islamic Revolution, is also another Principlist group, that will be seen as a heavyweight in the race. Velayati, who served as Iran's foreign minister for 16 years, held a press conference in Tehran on Tuesday. In part of his presser, he touched upon presidential race, saying: Besides Principlists, Reformists and Independents are also two other camps that have announced their bids for the June 14th presidential election. Hassan Rohani, former Secretary of Iran's Supreme National Security Council is seen close to the reformists. He is also said to have the support of Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, former Iran's president and head the expediency council. Another council member, Mohsen Rezai, has also announced his decision to run for president. He could be named as a leading independent candidate. Mohammad Saeidi-kia, another hopeful who served as minister in different administrations is also among the independents. ""Jebheye Paydari, or the Perseverance front"" has also formally announced his hopeful: Kamran Baqeri Lankarani, former health minister. Many experts say the different groups and parties should come up with few would-be candidate, but only time will tell if this will happen.

Pat Toomey's push to expand background checks on gun buyers apparently isn't hurting his standing back home in Pennsylvania. Nearly half, or 48%, of Pennsylvania voters approve of the way Toomey is handling his job, according to a Quinnipiac University poll released Friday. That's the highest job-approval rating for the Republican, whose proposal crafted with Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., fell short in the Senate. Toomey's job-approval rating is actually up 5 points since March, the poll shows. Toomey, a conservative elected in 2010, was one of four Republicans who bucked their party and voted for the proposal pushed by President Obama. The gun bill was a response to the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., that left 20 children and six adults dead. The Quinnipiac poll also found that Pennsylvania voters approve, 34%-29%, of the way Toomey is handling the push for gun control. When Toomey and Manchin introduced their plan to expand background checks, the Pennsylvania senator said he didn't view it as gun control. He said it was just ""common sense.""

"Given challenges still facing Somalia, a UN mission is needed to consolidate peace, official says Subscribe Now ! My Account Sign In Sign Out Home :: Military :: Library :: News :: 2013 :: April :: Military Menu Introduction Systems Facilities Agencies Industry Operations Countries Hot Documents News Reports Policy Budget Congress Links WMD Intelligence Homeland Security Space Military Given challenges still facing Somalia, a UN mission is needed to consolidate peace, official says 25 April 2013 – While the Government of Somalia that emerged from last year's political transition has advanced measures for stabilization and peace-building, multiple challenges require coherent international assistance, the United Nation's political chief told the Security Council today, recommending the creation of an in-country UN mission. ""The new Mission represents a fresh start for the UN in Somalia and a renewed commitment by the Council to support Somali-owned peacebuilding,"" Jeffrey Feltman, Under Secretary-General for Political Affairs, told the 15-member body. He said that the Federal Government, led by President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, has been implementing its Six Pillar Policy for stabilization and peace-building in the country, reaching out beyond Mogadishu in an effort to realize its vision of building a unified federal State for the country, which has been beset by conflict for over two decades. However, he said that the Government's approach to building new regional administrations is not accepted by all, with a draft charter ratified by three regions for the establishment of a so-called ""Jubaland State in southern Somalia, which the Government regards as unconstitutional. In addition, the Islamist insurgent group Al-Shabaab remained a threat, having retaken a significant town following the withdrawal of Ethiopian troops and ramping up suicide bombings, underscoring the need to rapidly strengthen security. As the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) was reaching its ""operational limit,"" he said, a better-funded and coordinated strategic security approach is required by the international community, one that ""recognizes that well-trained and equipped Somali forces are the ultimate exit strategy for international military operations."" In addition, he supported the Secretary-General's view that a new political Mission should work with the Government on its peace-building and state-building agenda, replacing the UN's Mission in Somali – UNPOS – which is based in Nairobi. Its role, Mr. Feltman said, would be ""to act as an enabler, helping to create and galvanize the political and strategic environment in which stabilization and peacebuilding can proceed, including by leveraging other parts of the UN system and international partners."" In a March 2013 resolution renewing AMISOM's authorization, the Council said it ""agrees with the Secretary-General that UNPOS has fulfilled its mandate and should now be dissolved, and further agrees that UNPOS should be replaced by a new expanded special political mission as soon as possible."" In that resolution it said that the revised UN presence in Somalia should support recent political gains and to address the urgent ongoing humanitarian and human rights situations and include good offices, advice and assistance on security, peacekeeping and state-building, the preparation of elections, human rights and the rule of law, and assistance for the coordination of international assistance. The Council, in that resolution, also agreed with the Secretary-General that ""the conditions in Somalia are not yet appropriate for the deployment of a United Nations peacekeeping operation.""

Gil Ronen and Maayana Miskin Apr 9, 2013, 5:48 PM (GMT+3) Familism Custody Family Courts Divorce Law Father Father and child (illustrative) Israel news photo: Flash 90 Journalist and radio personality Jackie Levy expressed upset Sunday over the problems facing divorced fathers in Israel. The issue of fathers losing contact with their children has become a national “scourge,” he warned. Levy’s emotional discussion of the issue followed a letter from a listener. The listener, who gave only his first name, Yair, said he had been cut off completely from his child. Yair told Levy and his Army Radio (Galei Tzahal) cohost Avri Gilad, “Many parents – mostly men – will ‘celebrate’ the personal Holocaust the Welfare Ministry has made for them, not to see their children. Like me, someone who has not seen his daughter for 428 days and nights.” “Someone has to stop this holocaust, with pardon for my use of the term,” he concluded. Levy responded, “Divorced fathers are not some tiny minority, we all know plenty of them. We need to understand that this is becoming a nationwide scourge.” “In recent days I have been trying to connect with some Members of Knesset, some of them friends of mine, and some tell me straight out that MKs who want to keep their seats do not want to get involved in legislature or regulations that could be perceived as ‘anti-women,’” he continued. “As if saving divorced men pain is ‘anti-woman.’ As if boys and girls are in a state of war in our world, like in fifth grade,” Levy said. “This primitive thinking needs to go jump in a lake.” Levy said the current system has “fundamental flaws,” adding, “I don’t want to talk about it because I don’t want to cry on air.” Levy has been invited to speak at a conference organized by MK Moshe Feiglin (Likud) on the subject of strengthening families and communities. Currently Israel's Tender Years clause means that in nearly all divorce cases mothers are given custody of small children. A United Nations committee has expressed concern over the clause and over high child support payments. Found a mistake?

The gains came on Tuesday as Syrian soldiers were clearing more Homs suburbs as well as the district of al-Qusayr, viewed as the main stronghold of armed militants in the area. Dozens of explosive devices were found and defused while army forces captured large numbers of other weapons from the militants. In the last few days, the Syrian Army had managed to seize a number of strategic towns and villages near the border with Lebanon. Among them was the village of Abel, which lies just four kilometers from the main route that runs among Homs, Damascus and the northern province of Aleppo. On Saturday, the army took four key villages of Qadesh, Mansouriyah, As'adiyah, and Radwaniyah - all located around al-Qusayr - in heavy clashes with armed groups. Syria has been experiencing unrest since March 2011 and many people, including large numbers of army and security personnel, have been killed in the violence. The Syrian government says the chaos is being orchestrated from outside the country, and there are reports that a very large number of the militants fighting in the country are foreign nationals. Several international human rights organizations have condemned the foreign-sponsored militants for committing war crimes.

The reinforcements arrived at the weekend and included about 40 nurses, specialists and hospital corpsmen, who are trained to provide basic medical care, Army Lieutenant Colonel Samuel House, a spokesman for the detention camp said, said on Monday. He said 100 of the 166 detainees had joined a hunger strike that began in February to protest their continued detention at the Guantanamo Bay U.S. Naval Base in eastern Cuba. Twenty-one of those had lost enough weight that they were being fed liquid supplements via tubes inserted in their noses and down into their stomachs, House said. Five were in the hospital for observation but did not have life-threatening conditions, he said. On Thursday, the president of the American Medical Association sent a letter to U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel reiterating its long-held position that it is a violation of medical ethics to force-feed mentally competent adults who refuse food and life-saving treatment. The letter from the AMA's president, Dr. Jeremy Lazarus, stopped short of asking Hagel to halt force-feedings at Guantanamo. It urged the defense secretary 'to address any situation in which a physician may be asked to violate the ethical standards of his or her profession.'

Share this article Share Hagel had just returned from a trip to the Middle East and it was unclear whether he had seen the letter, said Pentagon spokesman Army Lieutenant Colonel Todd Breasseale. Asked if military doctors had raised ethical concerns about being asked to perform force-feedings, Breasseale said: 'I can tell you there have been no organized efforts, but I cannot speak for individual physicians. Growing crisis: Around 100 of the 166 detainees have now joined a hunger strike that began in February to protest their continued detention at the Guantanamo Bay U.S. Naval Base in eastern Cuba (above) Row: Soldiers walk past prison cells during early morning prayer at Guantanamo. Some are questioning whether doctors were being asked to violate their ethics by force-feeding detainees 'I can tell you that we will not allow detainees to harm themselves, and this includes attempts at suicide - including self-induced and peer-pressured starvation to death,' he said. The military has said that some prisoners are pressuring others to join the hunger strike, and that some of those being tube-fed occasionally eat regular meals or voluntarily drink nutritional supplements when they are removed from their cell blocks and are alone with medical personnel. 'It has been the case all along,' House said. 'Some will eat one meal, and are tube-fed during another, while drinking nutrient at another meal ... Once they are approved (for tube-feeding) they are given the choice.' Military officials say the feedings are done gently, using soft, flexible, lubricated tubes. Attorney David Remes, who was notified by the military that his Yemeni client, Yasin Ismael, was being tube-fed, gave a starkly different description. 'It can be extremely painful. One of my clients said that it's like having a razor blade go down through your nose and into your throat,' Remes said. Growing problem: The military has said that some prisoners are pressuring others to join the hunger strike He said detainees who resist tube-feedings were forcibly removed from their cells by soldiers in riot gear. 'It's really like the way you would treat an animal,' he said. All sides blame the hunger strike on detainee frustration over the Obama administration's failure to carry out its promise to close the detention camp by 2010. Earlier this month, a detainee held for 11 years at Guantanamo wrote a horrific first-person account of life inside the prison in which he vowed never to eat again until his captors 'restore my dignity'. Samir Naji al Hasan Moqbel told of his ‘agony’ at being fed twice a day by guards who have forced a pipe so far down his nose it has gone into his stomach. 'Agony': Samir Naju al Hasan Moqbel, inset, has written a first person account of being on hunger strike in Guantanamo Bay On one occasion, he was strapped to a bed for 26 hours so they could feed him during which time he was not allowed to go to the toilet. In an opinion piece in the New York Times, al Hasan Moqbel demanded that he be returned to his native Yemen - and blames President Obama personally for failing to let him go free. He has been in Guantanamo since 2002 having been accused of being a guard for the late Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, a charge he dismisses as ‘nonsense’. Al Hasan Moqbel’s opinion piece appeared in the New York Times after he spoke to his lawyers at legal charity Reprieve. On March 15, al Hasan Moqbel was sick in the prison hospital when a team from the Extreme Reaction Force, which was eight military officers in riot gear, came into his room. He writes: ‘They tied my hands and feet to the bed. ‘They forcibly inserted an IV into my hand. I spent 26 hours in this state, tied to the bed. During this time I was not permitted to go to the toilet. ‘They inserted a catheter, which was painful, degrading and unnecessary. I was not even permitted to pray. ‘I will never forget the first time they passed the feeding tube up my nose. I can’t describe how painful it is to be force-fed this way. As it was thrust in, it made me feel like throwing up. I wanted to vomit, but I couldn’t. ‘There was agony in my chest, throat and stomach. I had never experienced such pain before. I would not wish this cruel punishment upon anyone.’ Share or comment on this article:

Matters YOU US TNS World Nepal landslide kills eight, victims mostly children By Reuters August 07, 2018 KATHMANDU: A landslide killed a woman and at least seven children in Nepal over the weekend as officials issued warnings on Monday of the risk of more landslides and flash floods due to torrential rain. Working in the downpour, rescuers in Bheri town, about 310-km west of capital Kathmandu, were still searching for a missing boy, having pulled out one survivor. ""Army and police personnel are digging with shovels through mud for a 12-year-old boy who is missing"" Krishna Prasad Khatiwada, a senior government official in Bheri, told Reuters by phone. The dead children were aged between three and eleven years. Flash floods and landslides in the June-September monsoon season are common in mostly mountainous Nepal, home to eight of the world’s 14 highest mountains including Mount Everest.

TNN / Updated: Apr 28, 2013, 05:50 IST Share AA + Text Size Small Medium Large Follow us West Bengal resident commissioner Bhaskar Khulbe’s abrupt transfer to an assignment in Kolkata is being interpreted as his failure to prevent state CM Mamata Banerjee and finance minister Amit Mitra from being heckled by SFI protesters in Delhi. NEW DELHI: West Bengal resident commissioner Bhaskar Khulbe’s abrupt transfer to an assignment in Kolkata is being interpreted as his failure to prevent state CM Mamata Banerjee and finance minister Amit Mitra from being heckled by SFI protesters outside the main entry gate of Yojna Bhawan here on April 9. Khulbe seems to have been unwittingly sucked into the controversy about whether the CM was informed in advance about the SFI’s protest (against the death of student leader Sudipto Gupta in police custody in Kolkata) outside gate no 4, the main entrance to the Planning Commission’s office. A miffed Banerjee, who had cut her Delhi visit short and returned to Kolkata without meeting Prime Minister Manmohan Singh or finance minister P Chidambaram as scheduled, had all along denied that she was tipped off about the SFI agitators and was asked to take gate no 6, instead. The Delhi Police, going by protocol, had informed Khulbe, who, too, passed on the message to Banerjee’s chief security officer on which gate to use to enter Yojna Bhawan. Political circles are interpreting his transfer order to Khulbe’s version being at odds with that of the CM and the rest of her contingent on which gate to use to enter the building. Khulbe is likely to be replaced by Vivek Bhardwaj from the West Bengal cadre.

The experienced climbers from Britain, Italy and Switzerland were about 2,000 meters below the nearly 9,000-meter summit, when disagreements began between the two sides. The Sherpas reportedly asked the foreign climbers to wait on the mountain while they rigged up some ropes, but the Europeans ignored them. Then some ice allegedly fell on the Sherpas, making them angry. Later in the day, a group of Nepalese gathered at the climbers' tents, where a loud argument ensued. The Nepalese allegedly pelted the foreigners with stones, and punches were thrown. In a statement, the Europeans defended their decision to continue climbing, saying they did not interfere with the Sherpas' work. They also said that despite the fact that ice falling is a natural occurrence during climbing, they were not responsible for knocking any down due to their actions. They also said they are unaware of any Sherpa coming forward to show any injuries. Sherpas are locals around the world's highest peak who are known for their climbing skills and knowledge of the region. They are responsible for fixing ropes up the mountain and accompany most foreign climbers to the summit. Climbing Mount Everest is a major tourism draw for the Himalayan country of Nepal. More than 3,000 people have climbed Everest since Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay first scaled it in 1953.

He declined to name the universities and foundations until deals are finalized, which  he anticipates this fall. EntreQuest first entered the university space last December, when it launched the Growth University, an online training and certification courses downloadable from its website. Courses range from sales to leadership at a fee of $297 to $497 per individual course, or a corporate fee of $30 per month per person. Mechlinksi says more than 200 people have downloaded Growth University courses since its launch. He also says that entreQuest this year plans to introduce the Growth Factor, video webinars that feature interviews with business leaders. Mechlinksi’s first book, “Grow Regardless,” was published last February. That same month, it hit No. 3 on The New York Times list of best-selling business books, No. 1 on Barnes & Noble.com and No. 5 on Amazon.com. EntreQuest offers help in sales, staffing and strategy to businesses. The entreQuest team spends 30 days at the client-company interviewing stakeholders and surveying employees, according to Mechlinksi, who says entreQuest has consulted with about 400 companies around the country since its founding in 2000. The fee depends on services and size of the client. The client receives a detailed action plan for the next year. For an extra fee, entreQuest will stay on site to recruit staff, provide training and fill any other client requests. EntreQuest has offices at the incubator, the Emerging Technology Center at Canton. Its staff also mentor other incubator tenants. The company has 11 employees and is currently hiring three, including a director of products, recruiting director and senior business consultant.

Many are growing anxious as they remain stranded for hours in the heat, with an inadequate supply of drinks. Due to traffic congestion buses are unable to make their way in and out of the parking lots near the holy site at an adequate rate. Visitors labeled organization at the site “disgusting” and “a catastrophe.” Speaking to Arutz Sheva , one said, “It’s life-threatening to try to reach Mount Meron like this.” “We’ve been waiting for hours with no public transportation, and some of the people here don’t have enough to drink,” the visitor continued. “We’re reporting a lot of cases of fainting, and there’s still fear of the worst.” Hareidi-religious Members of Knesset are working to bring relief for the stranded celebrants. MK Uri Maklev termed the current organizational failure “the mother of all collapses.” “No explanation could excuse this result,” Maklev said. “This is what advance preparations were for.” “We will draw conclusions and hold those responsible to account,” he added. Maklev said that MKs are working with a variety of parties, and hope to have a solution for the stranded visitors “soon.” A second MK agreed, saying, “It can’t be that after so much preparation for this event, we have this kind of anger and frustration, with men, women and children reaching a point of life-threatening danger. I’m working on every level possible to restore order immediately.” This situation was not the case in previous years, causing those stranded to believe that it was completely avoidable had proper preparations been conducted.

Mariela Castro had been expected to attend a conference next week on civil rights for the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender communities sponsored by the Equality Forum, according to Malcolm Lazin, the advocacy group's executive director. ""We find it shocking that our State Department would deny freedom of speech, particularly at an international civil rights summit, to anyone, let alone the Cuban president's daughter,"" Lazin said. State Department spokesman Noel Clay said he could not comment on the case because visa records are confidential. Mariela Castro, the niece of retired leader Fidel Castro, is director of Cuba's National Center for Sex Education. As that country's most prominent gay rights activist, she has instituted awareness campaigns, trained police on relations with the LGBT community and has lobbied lawmakers to legalize same-sex unions. Guillermo Suarez, spokesman for Cuba's United Nations Mission, confirmed that Mariela Castro was in New York on Thursday attending meetings related to the U.N. population conference in Cairo in 1994. She is one of the experts designated by Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to work on the 20-year follow-up to the action plan adopted in Egypt, Suarez said. ""That's why she asked for the visa and it's the reason for her presence in New York,"" he said. Suarez said Castro ""doesn't have any personal reaction"" to the State Department's denial of her request to travel to Philadelphia. The State Department bars Cuban diplomats from travelling more than 25 miles from central Manhattan. The Philadelphia-based Equality Forum sponsors an annual, dayslong international summit on LGBT civil rights. Each year, the event spotlights issues being faced by the LGBT community in a particular nation; this year, the featured nation is Cuba. Lazin said Castro had agreed to speak on a panel about Cuba on May 4 and was to accept an award for her activism at a dinner that night. He did not expect any visa problems because she had been granted permission to attend an academic conference in San Francisco last year. However, a number of Cuban-American politicians criticized the State Department for issuing Castro an entry visa for that event. They noted that U.S. rules prohibit Communist Party members and other high-ranking Cuban government officials from entry without special dispensation. Castro has no official link to the government aside from kinship, although the sex education centre is part of Cuba's public health ministry. ___ Associated Press writer Edith M.

  filed under: Serbia , Kosovo ( BELGRADE ) -  Serbia's parliament on Friday began debating 
whether to green light an EU-brokered deal aimed at normalising ties 
with former foe Kosovo, a landmark accord already approved by the 
government. The deal, which has come under fire from 
ultra-nationalists and Kosovo Serbs, is expected to win vast backing in 
the 250-seat parliament, as MPs from the ruling nationalists' coalition 
and from the centre-left opposition have already indicated they would 
vote in favour of it. The premiers of Serbia and Kosovo hammered 
out the deal on April 19 with both sides under strong pressure from 
Brussels to improve relations if they want to move closer to the 
European Union. The agreement was signed by the Serbian government on Monday but needs to be approved by parliament as well. The
 accord gives some autonomy to Kosovo Serbs living in northern Kosovo, 
who refuse to recognise Pristina's authority. While it has won praise 
from EU officials, it has angered many Serbs who see it as tacit 
acceptance by Belgrade of the breakaway territory's independence. There
 was a heavy police presence outside the parliament building on Friday 
where several hundred ultra-nationalist supporters gathered to protest 
against the accord. The demonstrators shouted ""treason!"" and ""you 
betrayed Kosovo"" at deputies heading into the session, and carried 
placards labelling the prime minister and the president ""traitors"". Only
 the ultra-nationalist and Euro-sceptic Democratic Party of Serbia 
(DSS), which holds 21 seats in parliament, openly opposes the deal. Addressing parliament, Serbian Prime Minister Ivica Dacic said Serbia ""has not had (control in) Kosovo for a long time"". ""Somebody had to do this (reach an agreement with Kosovo)... in order to put an end to the past,"" he said. ""This
 was to be or not to be, not only for the north of Kosovo, but for the 
whole of Serbia,"" Dacic said, drawing boos from DSS deputies. The 
government has indicated it might organise a referendum on the agreement
 in order to silence the opponents and ensure easier implementation in 
the field in northern Kosovo. EU Enlargement Commissioner Stefan 
Fuele, who was visiting Belgrade Friday, said it was up to Serbian 
authorities to chose the way ""to ensure that all the stakeholders are on
 the board when it comes to implementation."" ""Whatever the way 
they chose it should not delay the process but in the end make sure that
 the implementation is sustainable,"" Fuele told reporters after meeting 
President Tomislav Nikolic. An agreement on improved ties with 
Kosovo, aimed at turning the page on the last simmering troublespot in 
the Balkans, was the last major hurdle in Belgrade's efforts to be given
 a date to kick off long-awaited EU accession talks. In response, 
the European Commission on Monday recommended the launch of formal 
negotiations on Serbia's EU entry. It also recommended starting 
negotiations with Kosovo on an agreement that would bring Pristina 
closer to the 27-nation bloc. Belgrade and Kosovo Serbs refuse to 
recognise the 2008 independence of Kosovo, although more than 90 
countries, including the United States and all but five EU member 
states, have done so. Serbia lost control over its former southern
 province in June 1999 after a NATO bombing campaign halted late 
strongman Slobodan Milosevic's crackdown against the pro-independence 
ethnic Albanian majority and ousted Serbian armed forced from Kosovo.

Earlier this week, Rep. Johnson apologized for the offensive remark in a phone conversation with Roberta S. Clark, ADL’s Community Director for North Texas and Oklahoma, based in Dallas.  His verbal apology was followed by a letter on April 25 in which the state representative acknowledged that his comment on the House floor was “…a serious offense, and I have no excuse for using such a thoughtless phrase.” “What I said was wrong and hurtful to many good and decent people.  My words were unintentional and careless and do not indicate what is in my heart,” Rep. Johnson wrote in the letter. “After corresponding with Representative Johnson and having several conversations with him, I am satisfied that he deeply regrets his words and that he is sincere when he says that he did not mean to use hurtful language,” Clark said.  “While we understand that many people were upset with his behavior, we are disappointed that some chose to respond by leaving hateful voicemails and e-mail messages to his office.” “We accept his apology, and we hope that Mr. Johnson will make good on his commitment to learn from this experience and speak out against anti-Semitism and bigotry in the future,” she added.

The environment ministry today warned of strong action against oil marketing companies including closure of their plant, if there was any oil leakages in highly populated areas. CHENNAI: Environment ministry on Saturday warned of strong action against oil marketing companies including closure of their plant, if there was any oil leakages in highly populated areas. ""We (the ministry) are geared to take action even the closure of the firm considering the safety of human lives and environment,"" environment minister Jayanthi Natarajan said chairing a meeting with top officials of four oil marketing companies here. Recalling the recent incidents in Nagapattinam where there was oil leak from one of the pipelines belonging to an oil company, she said her ministry has directed the OMCs to follow guidelines which include the constant monitoring of the pipelines under SCADA system, repairing old pipes and setting up of a 24-hour dedicated team. Later talking to reporters, she said ONGC had laid pipelines for 700km in Tamil Nadu while in Chennai, out of 92km, pipelines run above the ground for 42km. These pipelines carry crude oil, naphtha and cooking gas, she said. Strongly advocating the need to create awareness on oil pipelines running under-ground in densely populated areas, the minister said she would discuss with the petroleum and natural gas ministry to replace such pipelines, if they are very old. ""Most of the pipelines (that are running underground) are 42-50 years old. I will strongly urge my senior colleagues in the petroleum and natural gas ministry to replace the pipelines. What can be more important than the safety of the human life and environment?"" she asked. Observing that her ministry would hold a similar meeting with officials of oil marketing companies in Mumbai shortly, Natarajan also directed the ports to adopt a 'standard operating procedure and response system' in case of an oil leak in sea. Noting that threat to environment also arises due to oil wastes, she said, the oil companies should have a dedicated area to dispose the oil wastages.

The renovation proposals for the street has been under a cloud of doubt following strong resistance from the part of traders, many of them a part of the retail hub for several decades, against any change. Over the years, traders have expressed fears about renovation plans of the street. In his statement, District Collector K.V. Mohan Kumar said the revised beautification plans had been worked out in such a way that the businesses of the traders would not be affected. The blueprints have been prepared by architect R.K. Ramesh. The Collector said strengthening proposals for two sea bridges would be finalised with the help from the National Institute of Technology (Calicut) in June and handed over to the Tourism Department.

All Rights Reserved Humans Have Empathy For Robots, Says Study News Tech Cars Entertainment Science Reviews Health Features Newsletter Advertise News Humans have empathy for robots, says study By Brittany Roston April 23, 2013  7:44 pm EST When a human sees the plight of another, we're capable of empathy, and it is a powerful thing. Many science fiction movies and books have asked whether humans can have empathy towards robots, especially as they advance and become more like living beings and less like machines. The answer to this is yes, according to a study conducted by scientists at the University of Duisburg. Advertisement The scientists presented 40 participants with videos of a small robot, shaped like a dinosaur, in two different kinds of situations: one in which it was presented with affection, and another in which it was violently handled. Using physiological responses, the scientists analyzed the reactions the participants had to how the dinosaur was treated, which was that humans had a strong response. Following up on this was the use of functional MRIs to monitor the effects of watching both violence and affection towards robots and towards humans. According to the study, the participants' brains had similar patterns when presented with violence and care towards a robot as it did when presented with the same towards a human. Advertisement One of the scientists, Rosenthal-von der Putten, discussed the eventual goal of developing companion robots that a human would form a relationship with, aiding individuals who need it with assistance and, for example, offering more independence to the elderly. Understanding how humans react emotionally to robots is essential to this goal. He said, ""A common problem is that a new technology is exciting at the beginning, but this effect wears off especially when it comes to tasks like boring and repetitive exercise in rehabilitation. The development and implementation of uniquely humanlike abilities in robots like theory of mind, emotion and empathy is considered to have the potential to solve this dilemma.""

While a hardcore activist, involved in many offences including attack on police armoury in Nayagarh gave himself up before the police in Malkangiri, four naxals laid down arms before the BSF in Koraput, official sources said. Superintendent of Police, Malkangiri, Akhileswar Singh said Sandip Madhi alias Sunil, 25, of Motu area of the district, gave up arms due to illness and disillusionment with activities of Maoists. After joining the outfit in 2006, Sandip was involved in incidents including an encounter with police at Pujariguda, Nayagarh mayhem involving attack on police armoury and other establishments, attack on a camp of Odisha State Armed Police and gunbattle at Badigata, he said. Sandip quit the cadre in 2012 and had gone into hiding to escape both the police and Maoists before deciding to surrender and return to the social mainstream, police said. In a similar development in Koraput, at least four hardcore Maoists with three single-bore guns surrendered before the officiating DIG of BSF, K S Sukla with a desire to return to the mainstream society. The rebels all belonging to Jhanjabati Area Committee of CPI (Maoist) have been identified as Jumbaru Kadranga, Ranju Kadranga, Malu Bidika and Malka Basia. “Non-bailable warrants are pending against them for their involvement in Maoist offensives under Bandhugaon police station. They will be handed over to the state police and will be rehabilitated as per the surrender policy of the state government,” said Sukla.

Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Image via CrunchBase Netflix says its quarterly profit handily beat expectations, swinging into the black from a loss a year earlier. Net income was $3 million, 5 cents a share, in contrast to last year's loss of $2 million, or 8 cents a share. More importantly, though, excluding a one-time charge related to debt extinguishment, Netflix made 31 cents a share. Analysts had only expected 21 cents a share. Quarterly revenue topped surpassed ten figures for the first time, with $1.02 billion. Netflix says it added 3 million streaming customers in the period, as it debuted more original content, the widely praised, Kevin Spacey-led House of Cards . Another show, Hemlock Grove , created by horror director Eli Roth, premiered last week. Next up: new episodes of the short-lived, cult-favorite, Arrested Development. Netflix has been one of the best performing stocks in the S&P 500 in the last six months. Shares rose 157% compared to the index's 9%. The company passed a particularly symbolic level this afternoon, when shares spiked nearly 20% and put the stock past $200 a share. Last time the stock reached these heights? You need to go back to 2011, to shortly before the Qwikster debacle (when Netflix said it would split its DVD and streaming service, a daft move that lost nearly a million customers). Since then, Netflix worked to increase its profitability--it was surprisingly free cash flow positive in the first quarter--and lure more customers with the new series. It is locked in a tight battle with Apple's iTunes store and Amazon.com's Prime video-stream service, and the company hopes that dramas rivaling any on HBO or AMC can give an important edge. More importantly, streaming revenue is nearly four times larger than Netflix's older DVD business, and that is why Wall Street pays careful attention to whether Netflix's subscriber base is growing. Recall the massive jump in Netflix stock in January when it said it added 2 million subscribers. Reach Abram Brown at abrown@forbes.com.

(q13 fox) Authorities in Seattle are asking for the public's help in identifying a woman they say attempted to steal pain medication from patients at a local hospital by posing as a nurse. Q13 Fox reports Seattle police have released a video of the woman, who was dressed in blue scrubs, black pants and clogs in an apparent attempt to blend in with the hospital staff, roaming the halls of the Swedish Medical Center on April 13. Staff members told authorities one patient said he saw the woman in his room manipulating a machine that allowed him to administer pain medication. “He woke up and confronted her and she says, ‘Oh I’m going to go get your nurse.’ Then she left the room and didn’t return,” Seattle detective Renee Witt told Q13 Fox. The man's real nurse later found that the IV line from his machine to his body had been cut and pain medication was dripping on the floor. Detective Jeff Kappel says the stranger also walked into another patient's room while relatives were present, acting as if she was checking another medication machine. When she left, a relative saw blood dripping on the floor and saw the machine's lines had been cut. The detective says about two feet of tubing may have been taken and possibly some pain medication from the tubes. In a statement, the hospital said no patients were harmed. Meanwhile, officials are warning all nearby medical facilities to be on alert in case the woman attempts to steal more medication. “She’s obviously confident and there is a possibility she may move on to other hospitals. We are hoping that people will be on notice at this point and if they see her to call 911,” Witt told Q13 Fox. Click for more from Q13 Fox. The Associated Press contributed to this report.

Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/PA Abu Qatada This article is more than 11 years old Abu Qatada: court rejects government's appeal bid This article is more than 11 years old Home secretary Theresa May running out of options in her legal battle to deport radical Islamist preacher to Jordan Alan Travis , home affairs editor Tue 23 Apr 2013 10.13 EDT Share Theresa May's legal battle to deport the radical Islamist preacher Abu Qatada has suffered a further setback with the court of appeal turning down her attempt to take the case to the supreme court. The home secretary is now expected to try the last remaining legal avenue open to her – a direct appeal to the highest court in the land – in her bid to overturn last month's appeal court ruling that Qatada could not be sent back to Jordan when there was a real risk he would face a trial based on evidence obtained by torture. A spokesman for the Judicial Office said on Tuesday that the court of appeal had confirmed it had refused permission for the home secretary to appeal to the supreme court. Appeals have to be based on a fresh point of law. A Home Office spokesman reacted to the decision by saying: ""We are disappointed with the court of appeal's decision but will now request permission to appeal directly from the supreme court. ""The government remains committed to deporting this dangerous man and we continue to work with the Jordanians to address the outstanding legal issues preventing deportation."" The home secretary confirmed last week that Abu Qatada, who is being held in Belmarsh prison for breaching bail conditions, could still face prosecution in Britain. ""He was arrested for breaching his bail conditions, and obviously consideration is being given in looking at the material that was discovered to see whether that leads to prosecution,"" May told MPs. She is rapidly running out of legal options and it is likely that fresh attempts will be made to secure even stronger assurances from the Jordanians that he will face a fair trial on bombing conspiracy charges should he be returned. The three appeal court judges, who unanimously dismissed May's last legal attempt to deport Qatada in March, reminded her in their ruling that ""torture is universally abhorred as an evil"", and states cannot expel someone where there is a real risk that they will face a trial based on evidence obtained by torture. The appeal court ruling by the master of the rolls, Lord Dyson, with Lord Justice Richards and Lord Justice Elias, threw out the home secretary's attempt to overturn a ruling last November by the special immigrations appeals commission (Siac) in London blocking Qatada's return to Jordan to stand trial because ""there was a real risk he would be subject to a flagrant denial of justice"". The appeal court judges said they recognised, however, that Qatada was ""regarded as a very dangerous person"" and that the British government considered him to be a danger to national security, adding: ""It is entirely understandable that there is a general feeling that his deportation to Jordan to face trial is long overdue."" But the judges said the fact that he was considered a dangerous terrorist was irrelevant to their decision.

State police have reportedly regained control of the facility. https://p.dw.com/p/18OQa Image: Reuters Advertisement A fight broke out between inmates in the La Pila prison in the Mexican state of San Luis Potosi on Saturday, leaving at least 13 people dead and another 65 injured. Concepcion Tovar, head of the state's prison system, told reporters that at least 100 prisoners were involved in the violence. Tovar said many prisoners were angry at a gang, which had been harassing and robbing inmates. The deaths were caused by sharp objects and other improvised weapons, according to Tovar. The state governor, Fernando Toranzo, said that 22 of the 65 injured were in serious condition. Toranzo went on to say that there would be an investigation into whether or not prison authorities had played a role in the violence. Mexico's drug cartels, which are battling over trade routes into lucrative markets in the United States, often carry their rivalries into prison. It remains unclear whether Saturday's clash was somehow connected to the cartels. The National Human Rights Commission reported in 2012 that inmates effectively run the interior of Mexico's prisons. Fights, riots and escapes are common. The Zetas drug cartel has been especially active in San Luis Potosi in recent years. slk/ch (AP, Reuters) Send us your feedback Your feedback Advertisement Skip next section Related topics Related topics Hernandez, Anabel Mexico About DW Who we are Press DW Global Media Forum DW offers Learn German DW Akademie Service Newsletters Reception FAQ Contact Topics from A to Z Headlines B2B Sales & Distribution Travel Advertising German News Service Follow us on © 2024 Deutsche Welle Privacy Policy Legal notice Digital accessibility Data privacy settings","Clashes between inmates in a Mexican prison have left more than a dozen dead and scores injured, according to authorities.

An earlier article on Bulatlat.com said the farmers' march marks the first anniversary of a Supreme Court decision that mandated the distribution of some 6,000 hectares of Hacienda Luisita, a plantation controlled by President Aquino's family. The police allowed the marchers, who had camped out at Elliptical Road, to get near Times Street but had them maintain their distance from Aquino's house, Quezon City Police District Station 2 commander Superintendent Pedro Sanchez said they are maintaining a maximum tolerance policy but will disperse them if they force their way to Aquino's house. He also deployed female police personnel to the area to help deal with the farmers. - VVP, GMA News Tags: haciendaluisita , luisita , noynoyaquino , cojuangco More Videos Most Popular LOADING CONTENT LOAD MORE ARTICLES RETRY LOADING ◀ All Rights Reserved 2024 © GMA Network Inc.

The Red River reached major flood stage over the weekend. MPR Photo/Dan Gunderson By DAVE KOLPACK Associated Press FARGO, N.D. (AP) -- The Red River appeared close to reaching its peak in Fargo and Moorhead, Minn., Tuesday after the National Weather Service dropped its crest forecast for the third straight day. The weather service adjusted the anticipated peak of the river to 33.3 feet, down from the 35.5-foot estimate that came out Monday and the 37-foot projection that was issued on Sunday. The river begins flooding at 18 feet but few structures are affected until 38 feet. The river was at 33.16 feet at 6 p.m. Tuesday.

""The situation could have been quite different if we would have had a normal warm-up and heavy rains."" Workers spent the last week building miles of clay levees and placing more than 100,000 sandbags in Fargo after receiving warnings from forecasters about a possible record flood. Cost so far is about $2 million. Fargo Mayor Dennis Walaker said Tuesday the city would have been ""foolish"" not to follow weather service guidelines. ""The naysayers say we should have known. That's ridiculous,"" Walaker said. ""If they want to be here in this decision process, they're welcome to it."" It will be the latest spring flood crest in history for the Fargo area, surpassing the 1979 event that reached its peak on April 19 at 34.93 feet. The city didn't see its first 50 degree day of the year until Friday. Walaker said the snowmelt went quickly last weekend. ""What was different about this one is the runoff all of a sudden was gone Sunday afternoon. It's gone,"" Walaker said. ""It's all in the streams, but none of the streams are overflowing."" Brad Wimmer, a city commissioner and lifelong Fargo resident, said he and other leaders might have benefited from ""slowing down a bit,"" but it was hard to do when the forecast started out with a flood range between 38 and 42 feet. ""I think everybody sort of in the back of their minds didn't believe we were going to 42 feet -- that realm,"" he said. ""But we don't want to say `I told you so' because the experts have to weigh in and we have to listen to the experts."" Residents in the area battled three straight years of major flooding, beginning with a record-setting crest of nearly 41 feet in 2009 that forced thousands to evacuate and inundated 100 homes. Since then the city has improved its flood protection by building levees and buying out homes in flood-prone areas. April Walker, a Fargo engineer who specializes in flood protection, said the city will learn from this year's event to help with high water down the road. ""We still love the years when the water doesn't rise,"" she said. ""But it's nice to be prepared for the event and to be able to exercise the machine without really being at risk.""

Matters YOU US TNS World Russian Constitutional Court approves Putin reform plan By AFP March 17, 2020 MOSCOW: Russia’s Constitutional Court on Monday approved amendments proposed by President Vladimir Putin to the country’s basic law, giving him the option of serving two further terms in office. The Constitutional Court published the ruling on its website and immediately sent the ruling to Putin, who could now stay in power until 2036. The court issued a speedy decision after Putin signed the final reform package on Saturday, though it had a week to consider its ruling. Putin, 67, last week backed a last-minute proposal by the first woman in space, Valentina Tereshkova, to add an amendment to the reform package allowing his possible return to the Kremlin after 2024. Under the current constitution he is not allowed to serve another presidential term, having served two consecutive stints from 2012. The new constitution would allow him reset his term-limit clock back to zero, paving the way for him to stay in power until 2036. The bill subsequently sailed through the upper house and regional parliaments as required last week. The Russian leader had proposed changes to the constitution in January but until last week denied that he was seeking to extend his rule. His spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Putin changed his mind because of global instability. The amendments also include stipulations banning gay marriages and protecting the ""historic truth"" of Russia’s role in World War II.

U.S. President Barack Obama speaks during an event in the East Room of the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., on Thursday, March 28, 2013. Obama, with families of victims of the Connecticut school shooting tragedy at his side, pressed the Senate to pass gun-control legislation next month and urged lawmakers to resist any weakening of resolve. Photographer: Joshua Roberts/Bloomberg via Getty Images The Five Senators who could get us to at least 59 votes for legislation on universal background checks are: Reid, Schumer, Durbin, Murray and Bennett. We would need one more Republican but I am not the right person to figure out who that would be. Wait, didn't those five Senators already vote for Toomey-Manchin? Yes they did (Reid sorta did). Haven't we been going after the four Democrats who should be ashamed that they voted No? Baucus, Begich, Heitkamp, and Pryor? Yes we have, yes they should, yes we need to change their votes. But how? Here are three possible ways to change their votes. 1. Appeal deeply, vigorously, and persistently to their consciences so that they can no longer look at themselves in the mirror or sleep at night unless they change their position. 2. Stir up their constituencies, and either by forcing a need to switch positions to win, or by recruiting a candidate who will vote. Make switching a political necessity. 3. Diminish their power in the Senate and severely hamper their ability to raise funds. Advertisement We need to work on all three. I think most Senators, including these four, are moral people who vote according to their values as often as they believe they can. Whether or not it is fair, U.S. Senators are unable to be moral purists on every issue. If they always voted according to their values, they would never have been elected in the first place. They could do it more often though, especially if they heard from millions of mobilized moms and millennials. In Montana, Alaska, North Dakota and Arkansas voters will not effectively demand that their Senators vote for universal background checks. 75-90 percent of the voters in those states agree that we should have those checks. Few of them will become single-issue voters. Democrats with more progressive positions on gun violence who challenge in primaries would face one of two fates: win the primary, lose the general election, or, just lose the primary, probably hurting the incumbent. Republicans who could successfully challenge those four are hardly likely to be in favor of universal background checks.

That brings me back to Senators Reid, Schumer, Durbin, Murray and Bennett. The Senate leadership and the Chair of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee are very powerful. They choose which committees which Senators sit on, and who gets to be leaders of those committees. They heavily influence how much support other Senators get from the DSCC, organizations, and from donors, particularly major donors across the nation. There is a double-whammy effect here too: if you have less power within the Senate you are able to get less done for those who support you and for your state. You have more trouble motivating donors to give and voters to vote. Less government money back to the state, less money to interested interests, less campaign funds, less popularity. Advertisement We might even swing back to the shame, morality, and values part of the equation if Democratic leadership stepped in. They could shame or praise Baucus, Begich, Heitkamp and Pryor, and not just with words but with real political consequences. As we focus spotlights on the people who voted the wrong way, let's also focus on the people who could turn them around. It is time for the Senate Leadership to lead. Time for the DSCC to find a moral compass. Time for us to demand that Senate Leadership diminish those four Senators' power. It is time for the DSCC to read those four Senators the riot act.

An extensive, on the ground study carried out last year by the International Human Rights and Conflict Resolution Clinic of Stanford Law School and the Global Justice Clinic at the New York University School of Law described the environment of ""constant fear"" under which Pakistanis in drone-struck regions, such as Waziristan, live. Monday's AFP report notes a ""growing number of Pakistanis living in the tribal areas on the Afghan border who ha[ve] suffered from conditions related to depression, anxiety and other mental health problems because of war"": U.S. drone strikes, fighting between Pakistani Taliban and the army, mass displacement, chronic unemployment and disillusionment are all causing mental suffering on an unprecedented scale in northwest Pakistan, say psychiatrists. ...""Depression is really high in Waziristan,"" said doctor Muktar ul-Haq, head of the psychiatry department at the government-run Lady Reading Hospital in Peshawar, the largest city in the northwest. ""There is uncertainty generally in Pakistan but particularly in this area. They are always apprehensive about the drones, about their lives,"" he said. While drone attacks do bring patients ""episodically"" for treatment, he says, residents in Waziristan complain of living in constant fear of drones that patrol in the skies above and the buzzing sound they say they emit. ""The sound alone gives us psychological grief,"" said Kaleemullah Mehsud, a man in his 30s from Waziristan, who spoke to AFP in Peshawar. ...There is a growing demand for locally made tranquilizers and anti-depressants - cheap copies of expensive drugs manufactured in the West.

Al-Jaafari said in an interview with the Lebanese NBN TV channel that the western governments seek to repeat the Iraqi scenario in Syria through questioning its sovereignty by opening its borders to undisciplined inspections by the UN under the pretext of chemical weapons use. Al-Jaffari said the western sides do not want an investigation to take place suggesting they know full well that the anti-government militants used chemical agents in the town of Khan al-Asal, near Aleppo, and elsewhere. The Syrian official said the comparison with Iraq is pretty clear as the UN also sent an inspection team to the country to examine weapons of mass destruction claims, but Iraq was occupied despite the fact that the inspection team did not find any WMDs. He also rejected claims by Britain and France that chemical weapons were used in Homs four months before the Khan al-Asal incident saying they would have reported it earlier if any such attack ever existed. The Syrian Foreign Ministry has written to the UN Secretary General Ban Ki Moon calling on the body to explain the details of a likely inspection in Khan al-Asal. However, Britain and France have demanded the team to be also sent to other areas of the country to investigate the use of chemical weapons. The request has been rejected by the Syrian government that says inspectors cannot have unlimited access to all regions of the country without coordination with Damascus. The Syrian government has also called for an independent inspection of Khan al-Asal saying Damascus and the UN could discuss the details on other alleged chemical weapons uses separately, though the UN has so far refused to do so.

The study had enrolled about 2,500 people, mostly gay men, in 19 cities. Half received an experimental vaccine developed by the National Institutes of Health, and half received dummy shots. A safety review this week found that slightly more volunteers who had received the vaccine later became infected with HIV. It is not clear why. The NIH said Thursday that it is stopping vaccinations, but will continue to study the volunteers' health. Multiple attempts at creating an AIDS vaccine have failed over the years. But researchers continue to try, pointing to modest success in a 2009 study in Thailand.

Peter King, R-N.Y. and Keith Ellison, D-Minn., clashed over whether or not law enforcement should increase surveillance of Muslim communities in the wake of the attacks in Boston. ""Most Muslims are outstanding people, but the threat is coming from the Muslim community,"" said King, who was behind the House hearings on Muslim radicalization. He continued: ""And in previous times, when certain elements in a community are the ones responsible for crime, the police focus on it. For instance, in Boston, the F.B.I. never spoke to the Boston police about the older brother. And afterwards, there were no intelligence files in Boston on these type of people, these people inclined to terrorism. The F.B.I. never even got to examining him."" "" I think it's ineffective law enforcement to go after a particular community,"" said Ellison, who is Muslim. ""Once you start saying, ""We're going to dragnet or surveil a community,"" what you do is you ignore dangerous threats that are not in that community and you go after people who don't have anything to do with it.""

The introduction of the new logo marks the first time that Microsoft Corp has revamped its logo in 25 years. (AP Photo/Steven Senne) After Nokia and Royal Dutch Shell, the Income Tax Department has sent a demand notice to software giant Microsoft’s Indian arm, which said, it had challenged the same. The IT Department reportedly sent notice to Microsoft seeking details of its income from Indian operations for four years beginning 2005-06. Details have been sought about income from work done at Microsoft’s Indian research and development sites on several softwares, which were marketed globally. When reached for comments, Microsoft India said it had approached the appellate forums for the resolution of the issue. “Microsoft complies with the tax laws in each jurisdiction in which we operate. We are seeking relief against the transfer pricing (TP) adjustments through the appropriate appellate forums,” it said in an e-mail statement. The IT Department notice reportedly does not quantify the amount of profits earned by its U.S.-based parent Microsoft Corporation that are attributable to the work performed at its R&D centres in India. The company said: “Since the matter is sub judice, we are unable to provide further details or comments regarding the same. We are hopeful that the Rangachary Committee recommendations on R&D Centres and Safe Harbours will help facilitate resolutions to TP litigations in the IT industry.” Last year, the government had set up a panel, headed by former Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) Chairman N. Rangachary, to address issues such as approach to taxation of development centres, tax treatment of ‘onsite services’ of domestic software firms and those related to finalising Safe Harbour provisions.

UPI/John Angelillo | License Photo NEW YORK, April 24 (UPI) -- Having babies go without diapers most of the time may be the latest rage in parts of New York City, but it's raising eyebrows among some, mothers say. ""Elimination communication,"" the diaper-free method of child-rearing, takes the techniques of potty training -- observing children for signals they want to go to the bathroom and getting them over a potty -- it just does them much, much sooner, The New York Times reported. Advertisement Adriane Stare, proprietor of Caribou Baby -- a Big Apple eco-friendly maternity, baby and lifestyle store -- and herself a diaper-free mother said parents are drawn to the method for a variety of reasons. Some do it to help the environment from the mountains of disposable diapers disposed of in landfills, some want to get away from laundering cloth diapers, and some want to get away from diaper rash. Some said they are rediscovering an ancient practice used in other cultures for millennia, but most say they like feeling more in touch with their babies' functions, Stare told The Times. However, there are misses, but even cleaning up a small mess on the floor is easier than laundering diapers, Stare said. Advertisement Some pediatricians are skeptical children age 1 and younger can control toileting behavior. ""I've certainly heard in other countries that they do toilet train babies earlier,"" Dr. Robin Jacobson, chief of outpatient pediatrics at Beth Israel Medical Center in New York, told The Times. ""But from what I've heard it's at about a year of age, not at two months.""

N. Copy link Email Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit READ LATER Remove SEE ALL PRINT Even as Delhi University’s Faculty of Arts finalised the syllabus for several of its courses like English, Hindi, Urdu and Psychology on Friday – there were several allegations of foul-play and arm-twisting from the teachers in many of these departments. “Discussion was not allowed to take place on the curricular content of the various courses before declaring them passed. The meeting, held on Friday afternoon, however, saw stormy denunciations by a large number of representatives from the colleges and university departments who felt that hardly any time was given to them to consider the courses. Teachers called for a postponement of the decision to next week but this was declined. It was also observed that the Urdu department did not have a single meeting of the Committee of Courses before finalising its courses. Many teachers from various colleges and departments submitted their dissent on not being allowed the right to speak in the meeting,” said Prof. Vijaya Venkataraman, who was present in the meeting. Many teachers alleged that a deliberate exclusion was being practiced in the process of syllabus-making. “Only a few teachers from the lesser-known colleges were invited to the meetings. Earlier there was a proper process of meetings and deliberations where even if a teacher was not part of the syllabus revision he or she was at least sent a copy. But now it is all so hushed up that the papers have been kept a secret,” said English teacher Sanam Khanna. Meanwhile, Hindi teachers were unhappy with the fact that they were not even considered in the process of making the syllabus and that the decisions were taken at the department level. “Hindi teachers were agitated over the fact that in the Committee of Courses, which passed the courses in the department, they did not invite teachers from the colleges. When asked, the Head of the Department responded that because the Department does not have seniority list, it did not invite college teachers. The regulations (16, 16 B (1) and 16 B (2)) require presence of at least four college teachers,” said one teacher. A petition signed by several teachers was sent to the Dean and Head, Arts Faculty on Thursday. Earlier in the month, the History department had several dissenters who refused to be part of the syllabus making. “The meeting was an eye-wash as the teachers were just told that the syllabus will be made, dissent or not, so the teachers really had no choice in the matter,” said a teacher.

Israel's National Security: The Iron Dome Missile Defense System
The MRC Israel blog takes a look at the Iron Dome missile defense system which was used successfully in recent weeks to defend Israel from rocket attacks by Hamas.
A few weeks ago, the Iron Dome missile defense system successfully intercepted a barrage of rockets launched by Hamas from the Gaza Strip into Israel. In addition to the successful intercepts, the Iron Dome system provided Israel with useful intelligence about the location of the launchers and the movement of the Hamas forces. As a result, the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) was able to pinpoint the locations of the rocket launchers and destroy them. Iron Dome has also provided intelligence that has helped to locate tunnels under the Gaza Strip which were used by Hamas to smuggle arms and other material into Gaza. According to the IDF, the information provided by Iron Dome was used to locate 21 tunnels and destroy them. Iron Dome is not the only effective weapon against the Hamas rocket attacks.

The attack came as Prime Minister Enrico Letta and his Cabinet were sworn in about a kilometer away in the presidential office, during a time of heightened political tensions in Italy. The two wounded police officers are expected to survive, but one was shot in the neck and remains in serious condition. Police were able to arrest the suspect shortly after he opened fire late Sunday morning. Italian Deputy Prime Minister and Interior Minister Angelino Alfano said that after the initial investigation, officials believe the attack was ""an isolated gesture"" carried out by ""a 49-year-old unemployed man"" who following his shooting spree apparently ""showed that he wanted to commit suicide.""

Latest News Wires Martha Stewart ruling: What it means for Macy's Martha Stewart's lawyers tried to get the lawsuit thrown out, but today's ruling says no: Macy's case against Martha Stewart will proceed. | Lucas Jackson / Reuters / File Martha Stewart departs the New York state Supreme Court after testifying, March 5. Macy's claims that Martha Stewart violated her exclusive contract with them when her company designed products for JC Penney. Ms. Stewart's attorneys tried to get the case dismissed, but today's ruling says that the case will move forward. Loading... By Anne D'Innocenzio Associated Press April 11, 2013, 8:44 p.m. ET | NEW YORK A New York State Supreme Court judge has rejected a motion by Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia lawyers to dismiss Macy's claim that the New York -based merchandising and media company violated its pact when it developed certain products for competitor J.C. Penney even though they don't carry the home designer's name. Lawyers for Martha Stewart argued Thursday that the exclusive contract with Macy's in certain products like bedding and bath items did not give exclusivity on design work. But Judge Jeffrey Oing ruled that Macy's has provided sufficient evidence that the contract does cover exclusivity in designs even if the items don't carry the Martha Stewart name. Judge Oing cautioned that his decision not to dismiss the claim doesn't mean Macy's will win the lawsuit against Martha Stewart Living. The suit charges that Martha Stewart breached a long-standing contract with Macy's when it signed a deal with Penney in December 2011 to open Martha Stewart mini-shops. Separately, Macy's has sued Penney for having no regard for the contract with the home maven and that it set out to steal the business. But Oing's decision could influence whether Penney can go ahead and sell products designed by Martha Stewart that bear the name JCP Everyday. Those products, which were expected to be shipped to stores this spring and housed in Penney's overhauled home area, are now in limbo. Judge Oing is expected to rule Friday whether to temporarily stop Penney from selling those products. A move to block Penney from selling the goods in the exclusive categories could be a financial blow to Penney just as the company finished a year of disastrous results that led to the ousting of its CEO, Ron Johnson . Johnson, who had been on the job for 17 months, had spearheaded a major overhaul of the company that failed to resonate with shoppers. Deborah Weinswig , an analyst at Citi Research estimated in a report earlier this week that Penney could take a hit of as much as $100 million on the JCP Everyday products. ""When given the opportunity to present our case, (Martha Stewart Living) lawyers will show that ... (the company) is a design house committed to designing beautiful, high-quality products and that our contract with Macy's permits us to license our designs to all retailers so that consumers can buy them wherever they shop,"" according to a statement issued Thursday by Martha Stewart Living. Meanwhile, Judge Oing dismissed Macy's claims that Penney intentionally interfered with its contract with Martha Stewart. He also dismissed Macy's claim that Martha Stewart violated its licensing contract when it shared the contract with Penney. Last July, Macy's won a preliminary injunction against Martha Stewart Living that prevented it from selling Martha Stewart branded houseware and other exclusive products at Penney. In August, the judge granted permission for Penney to open Martha Stewart mini-shops as long as the items covered by the exclusive contract with Macy's were not sold in them.

The stakes are high for all three companies, but particularly for Penney. The struggling department store chain is counting on the overhauled home department to help recover from a year of mounting losses and deep sales drops. Martha Stewart shops were expected to anchor the area. Penney is going ahead with opening shops filled with goods labeled Martha Celebrations, featuring stationery and paper products for parties. Those items are not covered by the Macy's contract. You've read of free articles. Subscribe to continue. Help fund Monitor journalism for $11/ month Already a subscriber?

My work in Kenya, for example, was heavily influenced by a Christian Science Monitor article I had forced myself to read 10 years earlier. Sometimes, we call things ‘boring’ simply because they lie outside the box we are currently in.” If you were to come up with a punchline to a joke about the Monitor, that would probably be it. We’re seen as being global, fair, insightful, and perhaps a bit too earnest. We’re the bran muffin of journalism. But you know what? We change lives. And I’m going to argue that we change lives precisely because we force open that too-small box that most human beings think they live in. The Monitor is a peculiar little publication that’s hard for the world to figure out. We’re run by a church, but we’re not only for church members and we’re not about converting people. We’re known as being fair even as the world becomes as polarized as at any time since the newspaper’s founding in 1908. We have a mission beyond circulation, we want to bridge divides. We’re about kicking down the door of thought everywhere and saying, “You are bigger and more capable than you realize. And we can prove it.” If you’re looking for bran muffin  journalism, you can subscribe to the Monitor for $15. You’ll get the Monitor Weekly magazine, the Monitor Daily email, and unlimited access to CSMonitor.com.

"AT&T would totally bring gigabit to Austin, provided it gets same deal as Google - Ars Technica Skip to content Ars Technica home Sections Forum Subscribe AI Biz & IT Cars Culture Gaming Health Policy Science Security Space Tech Feature Reviews Store AI Biz & IT Cars Culture Gaming Health Policy Science Security Space Tech Forum Subscribe Theme Light Dark System Sign In Cutting through red tape AT&T would totally bring gigabit to Austin, provided it gets same deal as Google AT&T wants the same ""rights of way, permitting, state licenses"" and the like. Cyrus Farivar – Apr 9, 2013 2:45 pm Credit: Cablefree Credit: Cablefree 192 On the same day that Google announced it is launching Google Fiber in the Texas capital, AT&T said it would be more than happy to do the same—that is, assuming that the telco giant is “granted the same terms and conditions as Google on issues such as geographic scope of offerings, rights of way, permitting, state licenses and any investment incentives.” ""Most encouraging is the recognition by government officials that policies which eliminate unnecessary regulation, lower costs and speed infrastructure deployment, can be a meaningful catalyst to additional investment in advanced networks which drives employment and economic growth,"" said Randall Stephenson, AT&T chairman and CEO, in a statement . On a conference call with reporters on Tuesday afternoon roughly an hour after AT&T's press release, both Google and the City of Austin were quick to point out that Google had not received any “economic incentives” from the city. “We haven't offered any economic incentives,” Lee Leffingwell, the city’s mayor, told reporters on the call. “It's strictly an agreement to expedite the process. That would be applicable to others. We have to look at [AT&T’s] operation and look at their application.” The general manager for Google Access (of which Fiber is a part), Kevin Lo, echoed this sentiment. “Like in [Kansas City], there are no special incentives,” he said on the call. “We believe it’s great when there's more user choice. We welcome AT&T's announcement. I think it's great that people want a [gigabit connection].” However, while there may not have been economic incentives in the purest and most narrow definition of the term, if Kansas City, MO is any indicator, the city certainly pulled out all the stops for Google. As we reported last year, the agreement (PDF) between Google and the City of Fountains specifies that the city will ""make space available to Google in City facilities for the installation of Google’s Central Office equipment and for additional network facilities,"" will ""provide power necessary for Google’s equipment at City locations,"" and ""will not charge Google for such space, power, or related services."" For now, neither Google nor the City of Austin has published a copy of the official agreement between the two entities, although a Google spokesperson told Ars that it would be posted on the city’s website. “Both Google and the Austin government worked hard to make sure that our agreement is fair, non-exclusive and transparent,” the spokesperson said. “The agreements address the same basic items, but since Austin and Kansas City are different cities, with different infrastructure and processes, the details differ.” Listing image: Cablefree Cyrus Farivar Editor at Large Cyrus Farivar Editor at Large Cyrus is a former Senior Tech Policy Reporter at Ars Technica, and is also a radio producer and author. His latest book, Habeas Data , about the legal cases over the last 50 years that have had an outsized impact on surveillance and privacy law in America, is out now from Melville House.
