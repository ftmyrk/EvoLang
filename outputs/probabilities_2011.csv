After 6 years of continuous, and often illegal, protests in and around the village of Bermagui (on the South Coast of NSW, Australia) the future of this community is once again under threat.

Indigenous Community to raise concerns about tourism development around Australia
Yacht owners and operators in Australia are now being asked to keep their eyes open for signs that the Indigenous tourism industry is taking a hard line against development of tourism infrastructure in and around Aboriginal Communities.
The Tourism Industry Development Association of Queensland has sent an email out to its members in which it says: “The State has seen a number of community concerns and in a number of instances the Community has refused to approve development for tourism and associated facilities.
“Communities may request a formal agreement be signed that recognises the Community’s right to veto tourism development within their boundaries, particularly in areas identified by the community as having cultural significance. This could include the closure of waterways, access roads and beach access and is being considered as a precedent by a number of communities.”

Japanese brands are struggling to recover from the devastating natural disasters that struck the country in March 2011. A few months after the quake and tsunami, Japanese firms are still battling to keep their brands going and the situation is unlikely to improve any time soon, despite a recent upturn in exports.
The earthquake and tsunami destroyed many of the facilities used by the Japanese automotive and electronic sectors. Toyota is still struggling to re-establish production, and Honda has also lost some of its production capacity due to the quake and tsunami.
A number of other industries have been hit by the disaster, with the port at Nagoya still struggling to recover. The port at Yokohama, the biggest on the east coast of Japan, was closed for six weeks. It is hoped that the port will reopen by May.
The Japanese government has announced an 18 month extension for companies that have suffered a reduction in exports. However, it is unclear if companies will receive compensation from the government if they fail to meet the targets",2011,-580998144.0

Sunrice Shareholders Reject Ebro Bid
Shareholders in the Malaysian rice processor Sunrice International Holdings have rejected an unsolicited takeover approach from Spanish company Ebro Foods.
A total of 75% of the shareholder votes cast in a general meeting voted against the €90m ($117.9m) offer. That leaves open the possibility of a takeover by a rival party. Ebro, which made its move via a Singapore holding company, had wanted to buy 100% of the shares for $2.75 per share.
The company said in a statement to the Singapore Stock Exchange that it would explore all other avenues for improving its shareholder value.
The Singapore Exchange said it would conduct a thorough review of the voting and other matters to determine the validity of the shareholder votes, the results and the implications.

Today’s 4pm ABC Radio National report by Stephen Long on the Surf Life Saving organisation’s financial situation highlighted the organisation’s inability to maintain the standard of service provided in the past. It also brought the issue of life saving back to the community.
The report highlighted the lack of funding received from the Australian Government, even though the Government’s decision to cut funding will directly affect the performance of life saving clubs. This issue was highlighted by a recent media article (see link below) which reported that 8 of 10 surf life saving clubs are experiencing financial difficulties. This has led to clubs being unable to provide the service expected by the community.
The ABC article also reported on the high risk taken by Surf Life Saving clubs in entering the commercial market. This risk is compounded by the Government’s funding cut, which will directly affect clubs’ ability to meet their financial obligations to investors. As a result, these commercial ventures may have to be abandoned.

Michigan Department of Community Health (MDCH) toxicologist Dr. Fred H. Paba said Wednesday the agency has confirmed the presence of a toxin-producing cyanobacteria (also called blue-green algae) in an area of Lake Huron near Ludington and Manistee, Mich.
Paba said an investigation is under way to determine whether the toxin is producing a substance called anatoxin-a that is known to be extremely toxic to humans and to certain animals, including fish and shellfish.
The toxin is produced by the cyanobacteria, which are microscopic organisms that occur naturally in many fresh and marine waters.
Paba said MDCH laboratory analysis detected anatoxin-a in a water sample taken from the north shore of Lake Michigan just north of Ludington. The sample was collected on March 30.
According to Paba, it is possible the toxin is being produced in the waters around the Ludington-Manistee area.

It's also a good idea to check with local animal shelters, or ask local farmers for the number of livestock you can keep.

The Tasmanian Liberal Government has been handed a major victory in the court over its pulp mill planning decision, with the Supreme Court of Victoria today upholding the decision by the former Labor Government to allow a pulp mill to be built in Tasmania.

The State Government's plan to expand casinos to the Gold Coast and broaden their playing areas is generating debate, with some concerned the move will encourage more people to play pokies.

The humble eel has the potential to revolutionise the transportation industry.
Scientists from the University of Cambridge have demonstrated that eels can propel themselves by using their electroreceptors to detect electric fields, and by twisting their bodies. The discovery of the 'propulsive eel' will revolutionise how cars and lorries drive. Scientists say that the new technology could lead to cars and trucks being controlled by computer and driverless.
They have also demonstrated how the eels are capable of using their electroreceptors to detect electrical fields as a way of navigating around obstacles. The research team says this could lead to a new way to control vehicles by detecting electric fields and steering them accordingly. For example, a driverless car could detect power lines overhead and avoid them.
The researchers hope to combine these two abilities in the future to make cars and trucks capable of driving themselves.

Kostya Tszyu is the greatest Australian boxer ever to grace the ring, but in his twilight years he has turned himself into an embittered, self-publicist, according to this report in the Australian newspaper.
I'm not sure I agree. In my view Kostya has achieved a lot more than his father did. Kostya has given Australian boxing the respect it deserves, and that is something that his father didn't do. He has also helped promote the fight against racism in Australia by taking up a lot of media space in the fight against racism, an issue that his father didn't seem to want to engage with.
In his twilight years he has achieved a lot of other things - the most important being that he is still the best amateur boxer in the country - he will fight a number of boxers in the amateur ranks before he makes his comeback, and he is the only boxer who will challenge the likes of Michael Katsidis and Daniel Geale.

"16 August 2011 - fears burn boost threatens ironbark forests
By Mark Elphick
Worrying about the future of the forests that make the Gippsland Lakes a world heritage site, researchers from CSIRO and Deakin University say the threat from bushfires has been underestimated.
The researchers, including Deakin Associate Professor Phil Mason, say 80 per cent of the Gippsland Lakes' ironbark forests are threatened by fire, with fire returning an average of every 20 years.
The research, to be published in a forthcoming issue of the journal Pacific Conservation Biology, says more than half the region's trees could die from fire in the next 20 years, threatening the health of the lakes.
Deakin's Prof David Bowman says that in fire-prone forests, fire can kill large numbers of trees because it reduces the soil moisture content of the canopy.
This leads to a drought effect that causes the trees to die.
Prof Bowman says the new study suggests ironbark trees that grow around the lakes can be particularly vulnerable to",2011,-582515520.0
"30 October 2011 - qantas grounding putting lives at risk
Qantas flight QF72 between Darwin and Cairns, in the Northern Territory of Australia, was forced to land at Melbourne after experiencing technical problems. At the time of the incident, Qantas was facing a massive strike by pilots after a failure to reach a deal with its pilot union. As a result, the carrier grounded all of its international flights from Australia. However, the grounded Qantas international fleet was made up of just 23 aircraft, representing about 5 per cent of the total fleet. Qantas was still operating a significant domestic network. On Monday, October 31st, Qantas resumed flights to Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane from Hong Kong, although other international destinations remained grounded. The carrier has promised to refund passengers, but not all passengers are happy.
For example, passengers on QF72 who were denied a seat on the first flight out after the grounding have filed suit against Qantas in a Darwin, Australia court, claiming they suffered damages as a result of the grounding",2011,-577530304.0

breakaway residents want council rates deal
RESIDENTS who have refused to pay their rates are set to strike a deal with the council to save their homes from foreclosure. They have agreed to pay half of the outstanding amount with the remainder being waived off.
The residents who have agreed to the deal are from the breakaway village of 27 households that have been living in the village since 2009 after they were evicted from their homes in the Mombasa area by the then Mombasa City Council (MCC).
According to the residents, the settlement comes after they successfully sued the council to vacate the order compelling them to pay rates amounting to Sh8.4 million.
The residents said they have been paying their dues since then.

"18 February 2011 - pokies opponents remain unmoved
After three consecutive defeats, the Labor government of South Australia appears to be gaining ground in its push for a referendum on pokies in the state. Premier Jay Weatherill claims that public support is swinging behind his plan to get rid of pokies, and the government will not back down. He is still hoping that his ""fairer gambling policy"" will pass with a two-thirds majority. If it fails, he will seek to have it passed in the next election in 2014. According to the South Australian Government website, ""Pokies currently contribute $2.7 billion in total revenue to South Australia every year. This is a significant part of our State's economy.""
Mr Weatherill argues that pokies make gambling addiction and family violence a serious issue, and that it's time for a fresh approach. In contrast, South Australian opposition leader Isobel Redmond argues that there is no need to change the current gambling system.

"19 October 2011 - office reno a 'glorified pliates centre'?
I'm trying to be constructive but the office reno project is turning into something that looks like a glorified Plastiques Centre. In fact I'm starting to wonder if the design team, which is responsible for this disaster, are not part of Plastiques or have been given a contract by Plastiques to create the perfect Plastiques facility.
The design team has clearly taken the minimalist approach. That is fine if the objective is to create a Plastiques facility but if that's not the case, it's a very serious failing on the part of the design team.
I thought the initial design was appalling. The walls are like the inside of a shoebox and very much in your face. I don't see the point of the walls being so close together.

THE future of Cobar Shire Council is looking a little brighter with the possibility of an increase in rates from the 2012/2013 financial year.
While the council had to endure a $700,000 deficit last year, it has a budgeted surplus of $400,000 for the current year.
And while a surplus of that size is welcome, it is still not enough to ensure a smooth path forward, according to Councillor Robert Taylor.
“We need to get back into the black because we’ve got to look after our community and our infrastructure and that will require money,” Councillor Taylor said.
“So it is an important step and I think that’s what the community has been looking for.”

The riots were the culmination of a series of events over the previous few months that saw growing tension between black and white communities in the area. A significant factor in the unrest was the police policy of ""stop and search"", which saw black and South Asian youth being stopped and searched on a disproportionate basis, often resulting in no arrest.

Posted by Steve on 30 November 2011
On 29 November 2011, we were at sea heading for South Australia. We were just about to start the crossing from the Great Australian Bight to Kangaroo Island, and there was a lot of excitement among us because we had a lot of people in the team that had never seen blue mud. I was really curious about blue mud, so I decided to do a small experiment. I took a small bag of mud and put it on the deck, and it just looked blue! After that, I wanted to know more, so I started taking samples of the mud all around the ship. It was amazing to see the amount of blue mud on the bottom of the ship!
As we were heading to South Australia, the weather started getting rough. We were sailing into some very strong winds, and the ship started getting some waves and getting a lot of spray on the deck. But it wasn't as bad as we thought it",2011,-569493376.0

While the market is used to the cold, it was a little unexpected and it will take a while for producers and packers to get back on track.
The weather took its toll on the red meat market yesterday, with beef the only bright spot as it traded up 1c at $5.84/kg.
The market has been in a poor position over the last few weeks as a result of the high number of cattle in the pipeline and the lack of demand. This is not helping the trade.

"02 November 2011 - regional airline subsidy
Yesterday we discussed the proposed $22m subsidy for regional airline V Australia. In this article we look at the broader issue of subsidised airline services.
We need to consider whether we want to encourage airlines to fly routes that might otherwise not be viable. The main issue with airline services is that they are very capital-intensive. A single A380 is worth many times the capital cost of an entire regional airline, yet it can fly the route only a couple of times a day. It seems a shame to me that a small regional airline with a couple of 737s and some turboprops is not capable of making a go of a profitable route.
An airline that does not generate enough revenue to cover its costs is likely to go out of business in a matter of months. But because we are now in the age of the A380, and Qantas has no viable alternative, we have to subsidise the service if we are to prevent the route being abandoned.

Bridget Brennan : So what is the Gene Technology Regulation Act?
Hamish Scott : Well, it’s a federal piece of legislation that is designed to regulate gene technology. Now the concern with gene technology, or genetic modification, is that you can introduce something into the genome that can survive in the population and that can be passed to future generations. Now in the environment, the concern is that the gene could change the behaviour of the organism, that could reduce the diversity of the population and that could even have negative effects on human health.

New Zealand's two major oil companies have expressed fears over the break up of ship owner owners in the wake of the ongoing ""Prestige"" oil spill in Spain.
The owners of the Prestige tanker are in liquidation after the ship sank off Spain last year with 58,000 tons of fuel oil on board.
In 1988 the ""Exxon Valdez"" oil spill caused huge environmental damage in the waters around Alaska.
New Zealand companies have major investments in the ship owners and their insurers.

WASHINGTON - The United States has told Pakistan that its ties with the country will not improve until it does more to crack down on militants using its territory to attack U.S. forces in Afghanistan, the White House said on Friday.
The U.S. warning was a tough public rebuke by President Barack Obama to a key ally that has grown frustrated by repeated assaults by militants on Afghan and U.S. forces and a perceived failure by Pakistani security forces to stop the attacks.
Pakistan has accused the United States of failing to coordinate with it on military strikes against militants in the tribal belt along the Afghan border, where the bulk of the 100,000 U.S. troops in Afghanistan are fighting a bloody insurgency against the Taliban and al Qaeda.

FARMERS on a 13,000-acre cattle property in South Australia have vowed to block a multi-million-dollar proposal to extract coal seam gas.
The property, near Tarlee, has been put up for sale by the Rothery family, who plan to use the money to develop an alternative energy source on the land.

Tax Office backs up WA's claim of royalty increase
The WA State Government has been told the Federal Government's royalties policy does not mean a cut for the State.
The Federal Opposition has described the tax office's stance as ""inconsistent"" and said the Government has no option but to intervene.
Minister for Natural Resources Tom Stephens said the tax office's new guidelines were in line with his department's view of the issue.
He said the tax office had confirmed the State would get royalties for all new gas and oil resources, no matter how long it took to find.
""I am very pleased that the ATO has confirmed the position that we have held for many years - that a royalty is payable on any resource which is discovered and not just on a resource which is produced,"" Mr Stephens said.

At around 5.30pm on Saturday 10 September 2011 the 52 year old male victim was in the passenger seat of a black Mercedes 500 SL car in the southbound carriageway of the A2 London Road.

After an absence of more than a year, exports of live cattle from Australia to New Zealand will resume in the next month or so, according to a range of industry participants.
The last cattle to be sent from Queensland were shipped in February 2010, and the New Zealand Meat Board (NZMB) has yet to obtain an export permit from the New Zealand government, which is required before the first shipment can sail.
However, New Zealand Meat Processors Association executive director Mark Holliday said the NZMB had received a positive response from the New Zealand Ministry of Primary Industries to its application, and was hopeful that the application would be granted imminently.
Mr Holliday said the NZMB was seeking a quota of 3000 head per year from Queensland and had applied for 4000 head per year from Northern Territory producers.

4 Corners analysis - Sex abuse of disabled child
The ABC Four Corners program that aired on Monday night revealed the sexual abuse of disabled children in residential facilities run by the New South Wales Department of Community Services. As the ABC pointed out, there have been previous reports of these sorts of abuses, including an earlier Four Corners program. Nevertheless, there has been no real action taken to prevent these abuses.
This analysis suggests that the abuse of the disabled in these facilities is symptomatic of the broader failure of Australia’s system to protect children and the disabled, and the failure to provide adequate services and support for these vulnerable groups.
In the ABC program, the NSW government and the NSW Department of Community Services (DCS) refused to take responsibility for the abuse. The government tried to blame the abusers.

It has been a week of high drama in international cricket. In the Ashes series, Australia made a great comeback and now stands only one wicket away from a victory.
The Pakistan cricket team's troubles have been well documented, with a match-fixing scandal threatening their future as an international side. In this latest investigation, the BBC's South Asia correspondent Quentin Sommerville says that despite being well down the world rankings, the Pakistan Cricket Board is still a highly profitable outfit. The BBC says the board receives more revenue than any other in the world, and its success is the result of the huge popularity of cricket in Pakistan. The BBC also quotes a former ICC official who claims that the board's relationship with bookmakers is as close as any other international cricket board.",2011,-453775680.0

The dolphins seem to have returned from the sea and been seen by people as far as Dorset’s Golden Cap. The resident seals in the Fleet are enjoying the warmer weather.
The whale that we were listening to on Sunday morning had probably just been out to feed and was returning home.
The dolphins and whales come to the Fleet from the north every year from about May to October. They have been seen here in the past, including the sighting of a whale a few miles south of the Fleet in 1988.

It was a super spring this year, with plenty of rain, warm temperatures and a prolonged wet autumn. But with spring comes a host of challenges for sheep producers including scour, liver fluke and even ticks.
Spring sheep scours are the scourge of many farmers. A common complaint from some farmers is the number of cases are getting worse, not better. A possible explanation is the increase in the number of lambs being vaccinated for clostridial diseases.
Some farmers are now vaccinating their sheep from weaning until 30-40 days before the end of the lambing season, with most of the vaccinations occurring in the autumn and early winter.
This means the lamb is receiving an early vaccination, then receiving a booster at six to eight weeks of age.
The result can be an increased number of vaccinated lambs that are then exposed to clostridial diseases.

Afghanistan war unchanged post bin Laden raid

Kabul (AsiaNews) - The news that Osama bin Laden was killed by US special forces in Pakistan is being celebrated in Washington, where many are expressing joy and relief. But in Afghanistan, the country where bin Laden was found, people remain skeptical. Many see the death of the al Qaeda leader as little more than a military operation to gain some political points before the elections.
The killing was carried out at the weekend by Navy SEALs operating on US soil, but in fact bin Laden was not found in the United States, but in Pakistan. He was killed there, in the same compound where his family lived, where he was not supposed to be",2011,-586483968.0

When the inn is full, it is the abbot’s policy to let those who came through the 99-person door leave the inn through the 1-person door. This is always done in a way that no one person gets more than one seat in the 1-person room.
Suppose there are 100 people lined up outside the inn. 99 of them are going to the 99-person room and one of them is going to the 1-person room. We’ll call that person the “winner”.

"02 March 2011 - forest moratorium protest in Melbourne
We, the people of Victoria, and of Australia, do not want to see our forests burnt down to the ground, as happens every year, for the purposes of a ""Forest Management Plan"" which is no more than an excuse for a new round of logging.
The Victorian Government's plan for ""Forest Management"" has been in operation since 1997, but the extent of destruction continues.
The Government's stated aim is to 'protect forests' by reducing fire risk in the State's 13 million hectares of forest, and to'make Victoria the best place to live, work and do business in Australia'.
It is not a 'forest plan' - it is a plan for the destruction of forests.
The Government's Forest Management Plan does not 'protect forests' because it is a plan for destroying forests - and in doing so, it destroys Victoria's biodiversity, destroys the water supply of regional towns, and destroys the health of our lungs.

"18 April 2011 - taste disorders linked to childhood obesity?
A recent study has shown a link between taste disorders and childhood obesity, suggesting that the taste bud cells may be responsible for regulating body weight.
This study suggests that a change in the taste bud cells (located in the tongue and in the upper part of the esophagus) is associated with obesity. The research, published in Nature Medicine, focused on mice and involved the development of a mouse model for human obesity. It is important to note that this research is not conclusive and more work needs to be done to understand how taste buds are linked to obesity.
Taste buds are made up of taste receptor cells (TRC) and supporting cells (SC) and the research looked at how TRC and SC interact in the regulation of body weight. The study found that the weight of the mice in the experiment was closely linked to the number of TRC cells in the tongue. This link was seen in mice fed with a high-fat diet which causes obesity, and mice fed with a low-fat diet",2011,-586654336.0

LONDON — David Cameron, who took a 4-month leave of absence from his post as Conservative Party leader, has denied he was motivated by racism when he decided to take a break from office. He also stated that he has not been subjected to any racially motivated comments and that the public had not been subjected to any racial comments as well.

From the New Zealand Herald, 11 February 2011
The Herald understands Bishop Larry has received a phone call from the Pope's representative to New Zealand Archbishop John Dew, and that the Holy See's official stance on Bishop's Larry and Vincent's decision to bless same sex unions was one of support.
Bishop Larry was the focus of the latest rally in the battle for religious freedom, as more than 2000 people turned up in his defence in Auckland today.
Bishop Larry and Bishop Vincent, the Anglican Bishop of Wellington, will bless same sex unions on Saturday.
Bishop Vincent, who has been one of the most outspoken defenders of gay rights, had planned to join Bishop Larry at the blessing, but cancelled at the last minute amid criticism from conservative churches.
The two bishops are expected to lead the blessing at a church in Ponsonby on Saturday.

The Chamber of Mines of South Africa, the National Union of Mineworkers and Solidarity have come together to urge all mining houses to be transparent about their land purchases and to sign a code of conduct to this effect.
The South African Council of Churches (SACC) has been in talks with the three parties since last year. This month they issued a joint statement, which the three unions have signed. The mining houses have been invited to sign, but as yet they have not done so.
The mining houses have said that they will buy land in order to provide for the needs of their communities. It is argued that this is a matter of social responsibility. The SACC, however, has pointed out that a major problem in South Africa is that companies purchase land and people are left without a right to their own land.

Mining royalties in Western Australia could be in for a dramatic change if an amendment to the State Government’s Resources Revenue Royalty Amendment Bill is successful.

The proposed change has been strongly opposed by the mining industry, which argues the proposal is tantamount to a “windfall tax” and a blow to foreign investors.
