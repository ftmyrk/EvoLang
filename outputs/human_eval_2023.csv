"There is everything to play for in this weekend's presidential run-off. Few Argentines saw radical candidate Javier Milei coming until he won the primaries in August.  He may have been pipped to the post by left-wing Economy Minister Sergio Massa in last month's first round but now polls put the two candidates neck-and-neck ahead of the decisive run-off vote.   One thing that is certain is that the economy will be the key factor in this election, which comes at a time of deep economic crisis for Argentina.  With inflation now topping an annual 140%, fixing the country's finances is top of the agenda for voters and candidates alike.   ""I personally have a little notebook with names of people who can't make ends meet and I give them items on credit,"" says Lourdes Monjes, who runs a corner shop in the poor Buenos Aires neighbourhood of Isla Maciel.  She has seen things get harder, especially in the past few years. ""My clients pay me back and then they end up owing again, so it's a vicious cycle they can't get out of,"" she says.   Isla Maciel sits in the shadow of Argentina's largest port, its houses made of wood and corrugated iron.  On the walls there are murals of Juan Perón, after whom the populist political movement Peronism is named and whose wife Evita was hailed as a champion of the poor.   With 40% of Argentines now living in poverty, many are desperately looking for another saviour. Sergio Massa, the economy minister in the outgoing Peronist government, is promising to move mountains to improve Argentina's finances.  His critics point out that it was under his leadership that the economy slumped to its current depths and that he therefore cannot be trusted with its recovery. But his supporters say he is a seasoned politician who can accomplish much if given a chance to steer things his way. The other choice is Javier Milei - a political outsider who has proposed drastic changes like abolishing the central bank and replacing the peso with the dollar. He also wants to liberalise gun laws and restrict abortion rights.    With increasing hardship among Argentina's population, there is also a growing appetite for radical change - and that is why far-right Javier Milei's profile has soared.  In the final TV debate between the two candidates last weekend, he made the case for shaking up the status quo. ""Ask yourself if you prefer inflation over stability, if you prefer this decline in production and employment or if you prefer economic growth,"" he said.   The other option, he said, was ""supporting this corrupt, parasitic and useless political caste, that just destroys our wealth generation and sinks us deeper and deeper"".  Mr Milei's style has captured people's attention.  He describes himself as an ""anarcho-capitalist"" and at one campaign event he wielded a chainsaw to symbolise his plan to slash government spending.  He has been compared to former US President Donald Trump - and closer to home - to Brazil's former leader, Jair Bolsonaro.  ""From an economic point of view, they are very similar because they have this idea that the markets solve everything and the state is not necessary,"" says economist Paulo Feldman from the University of São Paulo of the parallels between Mr Bolsonaro and Mr Milei.  ""You don't need to plan, you don't need to have government, you don't need rules,"" Mr Feldman says of Mr Milei's proposals.   But the academic says that that is not a viable programme: ""We know that this is not true. There is no country, no developed country that [carries out] this stupidity.""   Mr Feldman's views are shared by many other economists. Earlier this month, more than 100 wrote an open letter warning that voting in Mr Milei would spell economic disaster for Argentina. Nervousness around Mr Milei's brash campaign and lack of experience is something Sergio Massa is trying to use to his advantage. ""I know there are some who are voting for me not because they are convinced but just as a way to avoid choosing a path of violence, hatred and harm,"" Mr Massa said in Sunday's debate. ""I will ensure they feel that their vote wasn't wasted.""   Whoever wins, the next president will have a challenge on his hands.  ""Whatever comes next is going to be tough,"" says political analyst Ana Iparraguire of the difficulties of lifting Argentina out of its economic hole. ""It's going to require adjustments, budget cuts, reducing state expenses and that is going to come at a high cost, so we are going to have to wait and see how far each of them are going to go.""  Back at the port, a group of young boys are kicking around a ball in the street. In the distance are stacks of shipping containers.  These youngsters live in the shadow of one of Argentina's economic engines - yet their lives are far removed from any of its benefits.   Several of the young footballers are wearing T-shirts with Lionel Messi's name emblazoned on the back.

Transportation and commercial manufacturing were impacted by restrictions, lockdowns, and plant closures in many different countries. Delays and shortages followed, affecting the availability of induction cooktops. The epidemic has changed the priorities and behaviour of consumers. There's been a rise in demand for home-cooked meals as more individuals work and study from home. This change has increased customer interest in kitchen appliances, such as induction cooktops, as they look for quick and easy ways to make food.

Market Dynamics Driver: Aesthetic Appeal and Kitchen Design Customers currently set a greater value on kitchen application aesthetics and how well they blend into the overall decor of the kitchen. A common reason for choosing a household induction cooktop is its sleek, contemporary, and minimalist design.

Induction cooktops complement the extremely traditional oven-concept kitchen designs. A greater variety of cooking methods is now possible owing to induction cooktops, allowing for more accurate and daring culinary pursuits.

When buying kitchеn appliances, these are frequently chosen by default due to firmly ingrained consumer behaviours.

"nairobi, kenya --an elite kenyan police unit went on trial tuesday on charges of wrongful death in the killing of an outspoken pakistani journalist in nairobi a year ago. the case was jointly filed by the journalist's widow and two kenyan journalists' unions. arshad sharif was killed oct. 23, 2022, when the car he was in with another pakistani man sped up and drove through a roadblock checkpoint outside the kenyan capital and police opened fire. nairobi police at the time expressed regret over the shooting, saying it was a case of “mistaken identity” during a search for a similar car involved in a child abduction case. the 50-year-old journalist had fled pakistan earlier that year to avoid arrest at home on charges of maligning pakistan’s national institutions — a phrase used for critics of the powerful military, which has ruled pakistan for half of its 75-year history. he stayed briefly in dubai, the united arab emirates and the united kingdom before arriving in kenya. a team of pakistani investigators later said sharif's killing was a “planned assassination.” his widow, javeria siddique, filed the case against the kenyan police unit, known as the general service unit or gsu, that was involved in the shooting. kenyan police claimed sharif did not stop at a roadblock on the outskirts of nairobi but his family and pakistani investigators disagreed, saying shariff’s killing was planned in pakistan. “i am suing the gsu because they committed the crime openly,"" siddique said earlier in a phone interview with the associated press. ""for me, it was a targeted assassination because he was living in hiding in kenya after receiving threats in pakistan.” the case is being heard at the kajiado high court on the outskirts of nairobi and along with siddique, the kenya union of journalists and the kenya correspondents have been listed as joint petitioners. the plaintiffs' submission to court accuses kenyan authorities of “failing to prosecute officers involved in the wrongful death of arshad” and demands “a public apology to the family of sharif.” “it has taken us some time to go to court because we thought investigations will be carried out, and the officer who pulled the trigger prosecuted,"" a statement from the union said. “nothing so far has happened, so we are justified to go to court.” ochiel dudley, the lawyer representing shariff’s widow, said his legal team is ""assisting the family to pursue justice in kenya.” in islamabad, police have charged two kenyan-based pakistani businessmen who had hosted sharif in the east african country with involvement in his killing. the case has drawn international criticism from rights groups. “arshad sharif was politically persecuted in pakistan and sought safety in kenya, only to meet death,” said muthoki mumo, the committee to protect journalists' sub-saharan africa representative. “a year later, kenyan authorities have dismally failed in their responsibility to credibly and swiftly investigate the killing,"" she added. “his family and colleagues deserve justice, and a more credible accounting of the circumstances surrounding his death than the dubious story provided by the police.”","The case was jointly filed by the journalist's widow and two kenyan journalists' unions. arshad sharif was killed oct. 23, 2022, when the car he was in with another pakistani man sped up and drove through a roadblock checkpoint. nairobi police at the time expressed regret over the shooting, saying it was a case of ""mistaken identity""","On 01 March 2023, The case was jointly filed by the journalist's widow and two kenyan journalists' unions. arshad sharif was killed oct. 23, 2022, when the car he was in with another pakistani man sped up and drove through a roadblock checkpoint. nairobi police at the time expressed regret over the shooting, saying it was a case of ""mistaken identity"" and that the journalists were not armed. police did not charge anyone in the case.

"(WASHINGTON) — TheSupreme Courtis adopting its first code of ethics, in the face of sustained criticism over undisclosed trips and gifts from wealthy benefactors to some justices. The policy was issued by the court Monday. The justices, who have hinted at internal deliberations over an ethics code, last met Thursday in their private conference room at the court. The issue has vexed the court for several months, over a series of stories questioning the ethical practices of the justices. Many of those stories focused on Justice Clarence Thomas and his failure to disclose travel and other financial ties with wealthy conservative donors includingHarlan Crowandthe Koch brothers. But JusticesSamuel AlitoandSonia Sotomayoralso have been under scrutiny. Three justices,Amy Coney Barrett,Elena KaganandBrett Kavanaugh, have voiced support for an ethics code in recent months. In May, Chief Justice John Roberts said there was more the court could do to“adhere to the highest ethical standards,”without providing any specifics. Public trust in and approval of the court is hovering near record lows, according to a Gallup Poll released just before the court's new term began on Oct. 2. As recently as last week, Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said the justices could quiet some of the criticism and a Democratic push to impose an ethics code on the court by putting in place their own policy. Durbin's panel has been planning to subpoena Crow and conservative activistLeonard Leoabout their roles in organizing and paying forjustices' luxury travel. The committee has been investigatingthe court's ethicsand passed an ethics code, though all 10 Republicans on the panel voted against it. Republicans complained that Democrats were mostly reacting to decisions they didn't like from the conservative-dominated court,including overturning the nationwide right to an abortion. The proposal would require that justices provide more information about potential conflicts of interest. It would allow impartial panels of judges to review justices’ decisions not to step aside from cases and require public, written explanations about their decisions not to recuse. It would also seek to improve transparency around gifts received by justices and set up a process to investigate and enforce violations around required disclosures. The Democratic bill had little prospect of becoming law in the Republican-controlled House, much less the closely divided Senate. The push for an ethics code was jump-started by a series of stories by the investigative news site ProPublica detailing the relationship between Crow and Thomas. Crow has for more than two decades paid for nearly annual vacations, purchased from Thomas and othersthe Georgia homein which the justice’s mother still lives and helped pay for the private schooling for a relative. ProPublica also reported on Alito's Alaskan fishing trip with a GOP donor, travel that Leo helped arrange.The Associated Press reportedthat Sotomayor, aided by her staff, has advanced sales of her books through college visits over the past decade. The court's initial step on ethics, in the spring, did not mollify critics. Roberts declined an invitation from Durbin to testify before the Judiciary panel, but the chief justice provided a “Statement on Ethics Principles and Practices” signed by all nine justices that described the ethical rules they follow about travel, gifts and outside income. The statement provided by Roberts said that the nine justices “reaffirm and restate foundational ethics principles and practices to which they subscribe in carrying out their responsibilities as Members of the Supreme Court of the United States.” The statement promised at least some small additional disclosure when one or more among them opts not to take part in a case.
