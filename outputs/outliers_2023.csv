"Sebastian Steudtner already holds the world record for the largest wave ever surfed, but as the giant wave season begins, the German is looking to science and technology to chase a new high. Harnessing the technical prowess of racecar maker Porsche and autoparts specialist Schaeffler, Steudtner is seeking to dwarf his record 26.21-metre (86-foot) wave set at the Portuguese surfers' Mecca of Nazare three years ago. ""With the world record wave I realised I've reached a limit for how fast my board can go,"" Steudtner told AFP of his last run, involving the wave reaching the equivalent of around eight storeys. ""Together with Porsche, we asked ourselves how we could make the board faster and more stable,"" said the 38-year-old Bavarian. Surfers who increase their speed can take on bigger swells -- although it's not just a question of a ""need for speed"" but a question of safety as well. ""Speed is so important to us because the bigger the wave, the more speed I have to have to get away from it,"" said Steudtner. ""The power of the wave is an absolute force,"" he said, ""like having several buildings pushing you."" Steudtner said the pressure of riding the biggest waves means surfers need to know their equipment will allow them to focus on the run itself. Describing his record-breaking Nazare run in 2020, when he added almost two metres to the previous mark, he said: ""I shoot across the wave at 80 kilometres (50 miles) an hour and concentrate 100 percent."" ""I don't think about the past, the present and the future. ""I'm in the flow. I don't have time to think 'wow, this wave is beautiful'."" Steudtner first fell in love with surfing at the age of nine when boogie boarding in France. With his parents' blessing, Steudtner traded landlocked Bavaria for Hawaii to pursue a career in surfing at the age of 16. He worked on construction sites to earn money, while learning to surf in his own time. ""I've made a lot of decisions in my life that nobody understood at the time"". His burning curiosity may have taken him across the world but it has also propelled changes to the sport itself. Technological innovations could take the sport ""to a higher level"", he said. In order to truly let surfers harness and master the force of the ocean, surfboards need not only to be faster, but also more stable and manoeuvrable at extreme speeds. Porsche engineers helped develop a new board with an adapted nose, tail and edges to improve the hydrodynamics. Schaeffler developed a friction-reducing coating which helps the board glide through the water. Through tests in a wind-tunnel simulator, Steudtner was able to see how he should position himself on the board as it handles monster waves. ""Through changes to the board and altering Sebastian's stance, we were able to reduce air resistance by 20 percent,"" said Markus Schmelz, a project manager at Porsche. The innovations ""made the board faster and more stable at high speeds"". The new board, coloured yellow and black, has since been delivered. Steudtner, who trains daily in the gym to build up his muscle strength, was set for an autumn and winter chasing big waves. Accompanied by a team of almost 30 people, including military doctors, Steudtner said he hopes to ""understand the journey of the waves in the ocean"". With the power of science and design in tow, the German may be only days away from testing the board on the biggest stage of all. ""I'll have to give my best"".","Sebastian Steudtner already holds the world record for the largest wave ever surfed. The German is looking to science and technology to chase a new high.

"The Highlands' biggest arts venue has reported financial losses of almost £900,000 for the year ending in March. Eden Court in Inverness is facing soaring operating costs while ticket sales have not bounced back as much as hoped following the Covid pandemic. Inflation pushed up wages and utility bills tripled, according to a report by trustees. They said income from donations dropped by more than half and ticket sales had, at times, been disappointing. Trustees said the notable exception was its ""feel good"" work, such as its winter pantomime. Last year's show Peter Pan was its most financially successful pantomime on record, according to the report. The financial difficulties,  first reported in the Press and Journal, have seen the charity-run theatre and cinema complex dip into its reserves to cover the deficit. Action taken last year to improve its financial situation included the closure of the restaurant and making about 10% of the workforce redundant.

"Many experts believe Israel’s case is weak because Gaza has in effect been under Israeli control. Israel hasstormedGaza’s largest hospital andbombedresidential areas and refugee camps in attacks the United Nations human rights chief Volker Turk says have unleashed a “nightmarish” situation in the besieged Palestinian enclave. There are growing calls for a ceasefire as the humanitarian situation worsens with risks of starvation facing thousands due to the Israeli blockade of the territory – home to 2.3 million people. Israel and its allies, meanwhile, have insisted the bombings are justified because it has theright to self-defencein response to the October 7 Hamas attacks that killed 1,200 people and injured more than 5,600 in southern Israel. But what is this right to self-defence, and does it justify Israel’s killing of more than 11,500 Palestinians and wounding of 29,800 since then? According to Article 51 of the UN Charter, until the UN Security Council takes measures to maintain international peace and security, “nothing in the charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a member of the United Nations.” Ever since Israel embarked on the bombardment of the Gaza Strip, its officials and its Western allies – from theUnited StatesandUnited Kingdomto theEuropean Union– have defended Israeli actions by pointing to Article 51. Many experts aren’t convinced that it does apply. “The right to self-defence can be invoked when the state is threatened by another state, which is not the case,”Francesca Albanese, UN special rapporteur on human rights in the occupied Palestinian territories, said in an address to the Australian Press Club on Tuesday.      The attack Israel faced on October 7 came from an armed group in a territory, Gaza, that Israel has effectively controlled. Israel withdrew its forces from Gaza in 2005, but it has imposed a land, sea and air blockade on the enclave since Hamas came to power in 2007. That, according to Albanese, amounts to occupation – although Israel and its allies disagree with that assessment. “Israel does not claim it has been threatened by another state. It has been threatened by an armed group within an occupied territory. It cannot claim the right of self-defence against a threat that emanates from a territory it occupies, from a territory kept under belligerent occupation,” Albanese said. Albanese was referring to a2004advisory opinion by the International Court of Justice (ICJ), which said the construction of Israel’s separation wall in the occupied West Bank was illegal. The ICJ rejected the Israeli argument to build the wall, saying it could not invoke the right to self-defence in an occupied territory. Other experts point to the devastating scale of Israeli attacks on Gaza. “The death of a reported4,710 children, attacks on healthcare, the withholding of water and electricity – these cannot be merely justified as a ‘right to self-defence’,” said Iain Overton, executive director of the London-based Action on Armed Violence, which conducts research and advocacy on armed violence against civilians. He added that for Israel to claim this right without being challenged “would be a mockery of the international humanitarian law”. Armed conflicts are governed by international humanitarian law (IHL), a set of rules contained in international agreements like the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949 as well as other agreements and conventions meant to ensure that all member nations subscribe to a list of fundamental rules during conflicts. But member states do not always act by the rules, most recently during the Ukraine-Russia war. Israel has been accused of war crimes in its previous military assaults on Gaza, but it has not been held accountable. In the current conflict, though, experts said Israel’s actions seem to violate all of the four main principles of IHL: distinction between civilians and combatants, proportionality between anticipated loss of civilian life and damage and the strategic military advantage of an attack, legitimate military purposes and the humane treatment of all individuals from civilians to detainees and hostages. Among the dead Palestinians in the current conflict as of Thursday are 4,710 children and 3,160 women. “The scale of the bombardment and its impact on civilians raises questions about Israel’s adherence to proportionality,” Overton told Al Jazeera. Israel’s bombing of Gaza has also killed 102 aid workers with the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA), making this the deadliest conflict ever for UN staff in the organisation’s history. IHLunderlinesthe fundamental rule of all wars – that parties in a conflict must always make a distinction between civilians and combatants and that civilians and civilian objects must never be attacked. Hence, there is no justification for civilians being attacked by either side in the current conflict, and it is unlawful. Neve Gordon, a professor of international law and human rights at Queen Mary University of London, said both Hamas’s and Israel’s actions were “clearly war crimes”, adding that it was “obvious to anyone” that Hamas’s actions on October 7 violated IHL. “It is also obvious that Israel has committed war crimes in Gaza since October 7,” he said. “There is the collective punishment through the stopping of water and electricity, the compelled movement of populations and then the unleashing of eruptive violence that is killing thousands of civilians while destroying the very infrastructure of existence in the Gaza Strip,” Gordon added. Israel controls what goes in and out of Gaza. Even the fuel for its sole power plant, which has since shut down, has been supplied with Israel’s permission. Israel’s claims that Hamas is operating out of civilian facilities, however, are aimed at justifying civilian casualties, Gordon said. “When Israel claims Hamas targets in refugee camps and hospitals, the idea in both cases is to underscore that the value of the target is extremely high and, therefore, that Israel is abiding by the principle of proportionality even if many civilians die,” Gordon said. International humanitarian law insists thatmedical units must be protected. Similarly, international law also disallows attacks against places that are indispensable to the survival of the civilian population, such as drinking water installations and farmland. Attacking schools and hospitals during the conflict, as Israel has done, is“one of the six grave violations”, according to the UN Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict. Yet Israel has been unrelenting in these attacks despite facing heavy criticism. Experts have pointed to how it has relied on the claim, backed by the US and EU, that Hamas is using civilians in these places as “human shields”. US President Joe Biden on Wednesday reiterated the Israeli claim of a Hamas base at al-Shifa Hospital, Gaza’s largest medical facility. He offered no proof, and Israel has so far not shown any evidence for that claim either. One way Hamas uses civilians as“human shields”, Israel insists, is by allegedly operating out of schools, hospitals, refugee camps and shelters. But many experts believe that painting civilians as human shields is a convenient argument that Israel has used to create legitimacy for its attacks.      “When a person in a battlefield is defined as a human shield, …he or she loses some of the protections assigned to civilians by the laws of war,” Gordon said. “What many legal commentators say is that once a warring party uses human shields, lethal forms of violence that might otherwise be prohibited in a civilian setting can be used,” he added. Others, like Overton, said that even if Israel’s claims about Palestinian civilians being used as human shields are accurate, Israeli actions are still not justified. “The claim that civilians are being used as human shields does not absolve a party from its obligations under IHL. Even if combatants are present, attacks must still adhere to the principles of distinction and proportionality,” Overton said, pointing to how UN Secretary-General Antonio GuterrescalledGaza a “graveyard for children” on November 7. “This underscores the severe impact on civilians, suggesting that the claim of human shields may not justify the scale and nature of the attacks on civilian areas,” he added. Israel has also been accused of usingwhite phosphorus, which couldtriggerfires as well as lead to severe, potentially fatal burns. Firing white phosphorus is akin to an indiscriminate attack, according to Amnesty International, which affects civilians and military targets alike and hence is prohibited under international law. IHL makes it clear that parties to a conflict “may not order the displacement of the civilian population, in whole or part” except if military reasons demand or if their security is involved. On October 13, Israelorderedmore than 1 million Palestinians in northern Gaza to evacuate and move to the besieged enclave’s south despite the UN warning that Gaza faced a “real catastrophe” due to such an order. Israel has justified this order by saying it was aimed at limiting civilian casualties during its military operation in northern Gaza. IHL also lays out that all parties in a conflict must ensure that humanitarian relief operations are allowed and facilitated “unimpeded”. However, Israel had refused to allow essential aid into Gaza despite widespread warnings of a humanitarian crisis. Israel’s decision to impose a “complete siege” of Gaza’s power, food and water supplies has also been widely criticised for triggering a humanitarian crisis as thousands of Palestinians face “death by starvation”,according tothe ActionAid charity. Humanitarian law prohibits the use of starvation of the civilian population “as a method of warfare”. “The complete siege now lasting over one month has made it an agony for residents in Gaza to find basic necessities and frankly to survive,” Turk said last week, adding that “all forms of collective punishment must come to an end”. While lawyers and experts have pointed to likely violations by Israel and Hamas of international law and international humanitarian law in particular, that might not ensure legal action against them. Experts point to the lack of action against Israel for its 2008 assault on Gaza, named Operation Cast Lead, during which Israel was accused of war crimes. The 22-day Israeli offensive killed 1,400 Palestinians. At least 13 Israelis were killed in retaliatory rocket attacks by Palestinian armed groups. “Historical precedents, such as the inquiries following Operation Cast Lead and others, show that while investigations into Israeli actions in Gaza have occurred, they often have not led to significant preventative measures or accountability,” Overton said. In the current conflict, the UN Commission of Inquiry on the Occupied Palestinian Territory had announced on October 10 that there was “clear evidence of war crimes” from both sides and added that it had been “collecting and preserving evidence of war crimes” because it is “intent on ensuring legal accountability, including individual criminal and command responsibility”. “The killing of so many civilians cannot be dismissed as collateral damage. Not in a kibbutz. Not in a refugee camp. And not in a hospital,” the UN human rights chief said. At least three Palestinian rights groups have filed alawsuit with the International Criminal Court (ICC)against Israel during the ongoing war. And this week,French lawyer Gilles Deverssubmitted a complaint to the prosecutor at the ICC on behalf of Gaza victims. A US-based civil rights group, the Center for Constitutional Rights, has alsosued Bidenand senior members of his cabinet for “complicity” in the “unfolding genocide”.

"Corporate lawyers insisted that it be kept a secret, but a witness on the stand in theEpic v. Googletrial blurted it out anyway:Google pays Apple 36% of search revenues generated in Safari, a spectacularly high cut that makes it look like Google will pay anything to maintain a position of market dominance. As it's an antitrust case,that's not the impression it wanted to make. Ashley Belanger: According to Bloomberg Law, Google attorney John Schmidtlein ""visibly cringed"" when Murphy revealed the confidential information, which Google had initially claimed needed to be kept secret because otherwise it ""would unreasonably undermine Google's competitive standing in relation to both competitors and other counterparties."" For the DOJ—which has made theGoogle-Apple deal the center of its casealleging that Google maintains an illegal monopoly over search—this detail confirms how valuable default placements on iPhones are to the search leader. The DOJ has argued that Google pays so much for default search deals to block out competitors, lock search users into its services, and maintain a stronghold over the search industry—a dominant position that could be further entrenched by Google's advances with AI,Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella testified. In September, an Apple exec testified that the default deal between Google and Apple was seemingly so lucrative that it evenstopped Apple from creating its own rival search engine. It's obvious that companies such as Google use their market power to limit competition, influence other markets, all of it. The question is whether the courts and Congress are able and willing to deal with it.","Google pays Apple 36% of search revenues generated in Safari, a spectacularly high cut that makes it look like Google will pay anything to maintain a position of market dominance.

"The disappointing draw against Lesotho in the 2026 World Cup qualifiers opener has left Super Eagles fans disheartened and vocal about the much-needed changes they would like to see manager Jose Peseiro make to the team,PUNCH Sports Extrareports.The lacklustre performance, particularly by players like Francis Uzoho, Ademola Lookman, and Jamilu Collins, has sparked outrage among supporters who are now clamouring for adjustments ahead of the upcoming match against Mozambique.Peseiro has also been urged to rest Nottingham Forest striker, Taiwo Awoniyi, following his recent return from injury, suggesting that optimal match fitness might have made a difference in his gameplay.The Portuguese tactician has, however, been saved the headache of resting the Forest striker after it was confirmed that he would miss the Eagles next game due to a groin injury.Moses Oduyemi, an avid follower of the team, pinpointed goalkeeper Uzoho as the number one Eagle who should be benched.“Uzoho’s performance has been shaky lately, in fact, it has always been shaky, the only thing he has done that I can remember was when he had 11 or 12 saves against Man United and that was last year,” he toldPUNCH Sports Extra.“It’s time for a change between the posts.

We can’t afford such lapses, especially against tougher opponents. Perhaps sitting this next one out could refocus him. He did not join the attack at all and maybe that is even why Lookman suffered on that left flank.”The dissatisfaction with the team’s performance against Lesotho has extended beyond individual players.

He needs to adapt to the strengths of the players and the opponents. Otherwise, we’ll continue to struggle,” he said.Precious Ogbolu who watched the game alongside other embattled fans at a viewing centre in Festac, Lagos State believes that this Eagles side he has watched cannot win the AFCON next year.“I had high hopes for these guys, very high hopes but the display on Wednesday disappointed me.

Many fans have called for a reevaluation of Peseiro’s strategies and have questioned his ability to lead the team effectively.Tosin Soyemi, a Nigerian in diaspora, believes Peseiro has become too predictable and does not adapt to the game in real-time.“Peseiro’s tactics seemed outdated against Lesotho.

Peseiro has also been urged to rest Nottingham Forest striker, Taiwo Awoniyi, following his recent return from injury, suggesting that optimal match fitness might have made a difference in his gameplay.The Portuguese tactician has, however, been saved the headache of resting the Forest striker after it was confirmed that he would miss the Eagles next game due to a groin injury.Moses Oduyemi, an avid follower of the team, pinpointed goalkeeper Uzoho as the number one Eagle who should be benched.“Uzoho’s performance has been shaky lately, in fact, it has always been shaky, the only thing he has done that I can remember was when he had 11 or 12 saves against Man United and that was last year,” he toldPUNCH Sports Extra.“It’s time for a change between the posts. We need a keeper who instils confidence in the defense. They have invited Amas Obasogie, let them give him a try. This coach is a joke, asides Uzoho, why would he play Iheanacho at the wing when he has Moses Simon on the bench?”Deborah Uforomma, an ardent Super Eagles supporter, expressed her disappointment with Lookman’s performance saying, “Lookman was far from satisfactory. I expected a lot more based on what I have seen him do at Atalanta but he seemed disconnected from the game.

"Seven years after her skillful debutPark, which played Toronto and San Sebastian, where it won the New Directors Award, Greek filmmakerSofia Exarchouhas returned with her sophomore outing. Animal, which Exarchou directed from a screenplay she also penned, follows a group of young seasonal performers who provide entertainment at one of Greece’s many all-inclusive island resorts. Kalia (Dimitra Vlagopoulou), returning for her ninth year on the resort, is the leader of the pack, but she’s starting to crack. As the summer intensifies and the work pressure builds up, their nights become violent, and Kalia’s struggle is revealed. But when the spotlights turn on again, the show must go on.Related StoriesBreaking NewsAlexander Payne Talks 'The Holdovers,' Paul Giamatti Being The ""Greatest Actor"" And Teases Future Western & French Language Projects -- ThessalonikiBreaking News""The Profits Need To Be Shared:"" European Producers Talk Strikes, Working With Streamers & The Importance Of Owning IP -- Thessaloniki The pic debuted in competition at Locarno, where Vlagopoulou took the Pardo Award for Best Performance. Since then,Animalhas been one of the year’s buzziest arthouse titles, screening across the festival circuit and picking up awards. Next week, Exarchou returns home, with the film making its Greek debut at theThessaloniki International Film Festival. Below, the filmmaker speaks to Deadline about why she decided to make a feature about the dark side behind the Greek tourism industry, how a win in Locarno has changed the perception of her work back home, and how a fruitful filmmaking community was created out of Greece’s financial troubles. DEADLINE:Sofia, you’ve been on the road with ‘Animal’ all year. How are you feeling? SOFIA EXARCHOU:We went to Locarno, Sarajevo, Montreal, and Vancouver, where we won Best Film. Then Haifa, and now it’s actually starting to become too much. I’m going Spain, Viennale, Thessaloniki, Mannheim, Brussels. It’ll keep going until the summer, and it’s nice. It’s a good feeling to see your film is traveling and people are enjoying it. DEADLINE:Have you noticed a change in attitudes toward you and your work followingthe win at Locarno? EXARCHOU:I did also pick up awards withPark, my first feature. It won Best New Director at San Sebastian. But yes, I don’t know why, but with this film, I have felt a change in attitude. Perhaps it’s because of Locarno. We’ve also had very good reviews. It’s already been covered nicely in Greece, even though we haven’t screened it here yet. Maybe it’s also the film’s theme because it’s about tourism, and all Greek people have some relationship with that. People from the industry are happy for me, and it has changed how they perceive my work. But let’s wait until after Thessaloniki and the distribution in Greece. DEADLINE:How are you feeling about bringing the film home? EXARCHOU:I’m excited. Firstly, most of the cast and crew are coming from Athens to watch the film together. We’re going to be a big gang of more than 40 people. Many of them haven’t seen the film yet because we didn’t have the time to set up a private screening. I’m excited to be in my country, although it’s sometimes stressful. It’s a totally different feeling. You’re not among foreigners. You’re among people who you have worked with and family friends, and you want them to like it. It also feels like the end of the film’s journey, you know. I’ve done this film. I shot it. And now it’s screened in my country. DEADLINE:What would be a success in Greece for you with ‘Animal’? EXARCHOU:Well, we worry about the film’s distribution. It’s tough here for Greek films to do well in the cinemas. But that would be something that I would like to happen. I would enjoy people in my country going to the cinemas to watch the film. Of course, I enjoy going to festivals, but it’s different. Communicating with audiences in Greece would be a success for me. DEADLINE:Can you tell me a little about the genesis behind the film’s story? EXARCHOU:I started writing the script because I wanted to make a movie about work and working systems. From there, it was obvious to me that if I wanted to talk about work in Greece, the tourism industry would be the core of it. This led me to the idea of performers working in a hotel during the summer. Suddenly, it all made sense with the notion of entertainment, which, for me, is intriguing in capitalism: The idea of how we need to keep people entertained all day to keep the system rolling. DEADLINE:Despite the financial hardships and volatile political environment, it feels like there has been a fruitful new filmmaking wave in Greece. What has it been like working in these conditions? EXARCHOU:It has been difficult. We had an economic crisis, and many things changed in the industry. I started working before the crisis. It was much easier to make films and to work in films with good salaries. With the crisis, it was almost impossible to have a job. On the other hand, we built a small community because of all the struggle. Everybody was helping each other. Plus, sometimes, when everything is collapsing, an energy is created where you want to present your universe to the world.  You have this anger and stress, which is a big motivation for an artist. DEADLINE:What’s next for you? EXARCHOU:I still have some work onAnimal. We took it to Locarno very quickly, so a lot of promotion hasn’t been done. We’re now working on a trailer and a poster. I have an idea for a new project, but I need to relax first.  I feel quite drained after all these years of work, especially the last two. It’s really important to recharge the batteries in your brain before beginning a screenplay, which is the most difficult step in the creation.","Sofia Exarchou's sophomore outing follows a group of young seasonal performers who provide entertainment at one of Greece’s many all-inclusive island resorts.

"Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Friday that the sanctions on Moscow mostly boomeranged on those who imposed them and inspired Russia to develop its own industry. President Vladimir Putin’s spokesman was answering a question aboutThursday’s resolutionof the European Parliament, which called for tougher sanctions on Moscow but argued against  confiscating the personal belongings of Russians – such as personal vehicles – because“such over compliance discredits the goal and instrument of sanctions.” “Many are beginning to see the light and understand that, firstly, the sanctions backfired on them, and secondly, turned out to be not so painful and pushed us to build up our own potential,” Peskov said at a press briefing. Earlier this week, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrovpointed outthat EU companies have lost at least €250 billion ($266.6 billion) due to the embargoes put in place over the Ukraine conflict. He said these were“very conservative estimates”and that the true cost of unilateral measures could be even higher. The decision to cut ties with Russia has made the EU dependent on“expensive American energy”instead, causing an industrial crisis. The“terrorist attacks”on the Nord Stream gas pipelines in September 2022 ended all hopes of restoring the flow of affordable Russian gas to the EU economies, Lavrov said. “The West decided to destroy the world economy for the sake of teaching Russia a lesson,”Lavrov told a roundtable of Russian ambassadors in Moscow. For this reason, Lavrov explained, Russia does not expect the sanctions to be lifted any time soon, and has chosen to build new transport corridors and supply chains that will be“beyond the control of malicious influence”from the West. Deputy Prime Minister Andrey Belousov said last week that the West predicted“a catastrophe comparable to the 1990s”for Russia and was“shocked”when that did not happen. Instead, Russia entered a period of“strengthening sovereignty,”leveraging its education, science, technology, infrastructure and natural resources. While Russia’s GDP fell by 2.1% in 2022, it has since recovered and is on track to grow by 2.8% by the end of 2023, according to the Kremlin. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimates Russian GDP will grow 2.2%, up from its April forecast of 0.7%.","Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Friday that the sanctions on Moscow mostly boomeranged on those who imposed them.

"from 7 a.m. onward sunday, ballot boxes in poland started filling up so fast that spare ones had to be dusted off and more ballots needed to be printed. no one had anticipated such long lines throughout the country. voting was to end at 9 p.m., but by law, polling stations stayed open to accept all who queued up, and the last one closed at 5 a.m. monday. some voters braved the night chill for up to eight hours to cast their vote. this resulted in a record turnout of nearly 74% -- highest voter turnout in poland since 1919 and even higher than that of the first free elections after the fall of communism in 1989.  the high turnout confirmed that millions of poles agree these parliamentary elections may have been the most decisive in the last three decades. either they would allow the ruling right-wing populist law and justice (pis) party to extend its eight-year hold on power for another four-year term, or they would opt for the return of a liberal democracy. late poll figures univocally indicate that opposition parties stand a realistic chance to form poland's next government. the pis conservatives currently in power took 36% of the vote, but that doesn't translate into a seat majority in parliament, which would allow it to form a cabinet. latest polls show they would have 196 deputies in the 460-seat legislature as opposed to 249 seats won by the broad civic coalition of opposition parties led by donald tusk, former president of the european council. sunday's vote was a confrontation of two radically different visions of poland's future. conditioned by pis propaganda that has continually been exploiting fears, pis supporters claim only that party can secure poland's sovereignty and protect its interests. the threat of illegal migrants is perhaps the most unifying emotion binding the pis electorate. supporters see pis as their only protector from the alleged dominance of european union bureaucrats in brussels and their meddling in polish affairs. pis voters turn a blind eye to the fact that the country began to drift toward authoritarian rule, authorities neglect the eu's legal norms and the country continues on a collision course with the union. some €36 billion of eu covid pandemic recovery funds have been frozen in a row over pis judicial reforms. many observers believe another pis term would result in poland leaving the european union. germany, poland's by far most important trade partner and neighbor, is presented as another source of fear and the country is made out to be an ally of russia, poland's greatest foe throughout centuries. but if it's not the threat of german capital buying out polish industry, then it's the threat of moral decay. in order to appeal to radical voters who accuse the government of extending excessive welfare to ukrainian refugees, authorities cynically strained relations with kyiv. pis voters declare the fear that if the party loses, the next government would take away the generous social benefits pis guaranteed, such as 14 pensions, child care payments and early retirement. those who sunday voted for parties forming the anti-pis coalition declare they voted for a poland securely rooted in the european union. in radio and tv street interviews, they say they want to see poland mend its strained relations with neighbors, particularly germany and ukraine. they do not want to see the catholic church influencing state affairs. sixty-four percent of those polled declare they're in favor of same-sex marriages, and 70% want the new government to liberalize the current strict anti-abortion law. it is uncertain whether poland's new government will be prepared to meet the more liberal postulates voters expect. the potential ruling coalition's unifying factor is its pro-democratic, pro-eu, anti-pis stance. other than that, they often differ in their proposed policies and outlook. they're a broad coalition composed of parties spanning from the far left to liberal conservative. the civic coalition's clear victory makes it the only faction in parliament able to constitute poland's new government. but first, polish president andrzej duda, a pis nominee, will need to designate a prime minister. most likely, against the odds, he will name a pis candidate. that candidate will have little realistic chance of being approved by parliament, and poland may be faced with many weeks of squabbling and chaos. constitutionalists predict it may not be until december that poland gets its new government.","Voting was to end at 9 p.m., but by law, polling stations stayed

"Issued by Defence Media3 November 2023 The Royal Australian Navy has worked with defence industry to test autonomous and uncrewed systems that have the capacity to transform the way Navy conducts maritime warfare. Held at Jervis Bay over two weeks, Exercise Autonomous Warrior tested a range of autonomous technologies below and on the surface of the ocean. This year's exercise focused on the development and evaluation of autonomous undersea warfare systems and related future operating concepts, critical to the Australian Defence Force's ongoing operational success. Autonomous Warriorprovides a controlled environment to continue developing trusted autonomy and to ensure these systems complement Navy's submarine and surface fleet. Uncrewed undersea warfare exercises such as this allow Defence to lift its capacity to rapidly translate disruptive new technology into capability, in close partnership with Australian industry, as recommended in the Defence Strategic Review. Head Navy Capability, Rear Admiral Stephen Hughes, AM, CSC, RAN, said Autonomous Warrior assists with accelerating the delivery of complementary capabilities to the fleet, providing Navy with asymmetric warfighting effect options.

"THE HAGUE, Netherlands --Anti-Islam populist Geert Wilders won a huge victory in Dutchelections, according to a near complete count of the vote early Thursday, in a stunning lurch to the far right for a nation once famed as a beacon of tolerance. The result will send shockwaves through Europe, where far-right ideology is on the rise, and puts Wilders in line to lead talks to form the next governing coalition and possibly become the first far-right prime minister of the Netherlands. With nearly all votes counted, Wilders' Party for Freedom was forecast to win 37 seats in the 150-seat lower house of parliament, two more than predicted by an exit poll when voting finished Wednesday night and more than double the 17 he won at the last election. “I had to pinch my arm,” a jubilant Wilders said. Political parties were set to hold separate meetings Thursday to discuss the outcome before what is likely to be an arduous process of forming a new governing coalition begins Friday. Despite his harsh rhetoric, Wilders has already begun courting other right and center parties by saying in a victory speech that whatever policies he pushes will be “within the law and constitution.” Wilders’ election program included calls for a referendum on the Netherlands leaving the European Union, a total halt to accepting asylum-seekers and migrant pushbacks at Dutch borders. It also advocates the “de-Islamization” of the Netherlands. He says he wants no mosques or Islamic schools in the country, although he has been milder about Islam during this election campaign than in the past. Instead, his victory seems based on his campaign to rein-in migration -— the issue that caused the last governing coalition to quit in July —- and tackle issues such as the cost-of-living crisis and housing shortages. “Voters said, ‘We are sick of it. Sick to our stomachs,’"" he said, adding he is now on a mission to end the “asylum tsunami,” referring to the migration issue that came to dominate his campaign. “The Dutch will be No. 1 again,” Wilders said. “The people must get their nation back.” But Wilders, who has in the past been labeled a Dutch version ofDonald Trump, first must form a coalition government before he can take the reins of power. That will be tough as mainstream parties are reluctant to join forces with him and his party, but the size of his victory strengthens his hand in any negotiations. Wilders called on other parties to constructively engage in coalition talks. Pieter Omtzigt, a former centrist Christian Democrat who built his own New Social Contract party in three months to take 20 seats, said he would always be open to talks. The closest party to Wilders' in the election was an alliance of the center-left Labor Party and Green Left, which was forecast to win 25 seats. But its leader, Frans Timmermans, made clear that Wilders should not count on a coalition with him. “We will never form a coalition with parties that pretend that asylum seekers are the source of all misery,” Timmermans said, vowing to defend Dutch democracy. The historic victory came one year after the win of Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni, whose Brothers of Italy’s roots were steeped in nostalgia for fascist dictator Benito Mussolini. Meloni has since mellowed her stance on several issues and has become the acceptable face of the hard right in the EU. Wilders was long a firebrand lashing out at Islam, at the EU and migrants -— a stance which brought him close to power but never in it, in a nation known for compromise politics. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who boasts of turning Hungary into an “illiberal” state and has similarly harsh stances on migration and EU institutions, was quick to congratulate Wilders. “The winds of change are here! Congratulations,” Orban said. During the final weeks of his campaign, Wilders somewhat softened his stance and vowed that he would be a prime minister for all Dutch people, so much so that he gained the moniker Geert “Milders.” The election was called after the fourth and final coalition of outgoing Prime Minister Mark Rutte resigned in July after failing to agree to measures to rein-in migration. Rutte was replaced by Dilan Yeşilgöz-Zegerius, a former refugee from Turkey who could have become the country's first female prime minister had her party won the most votes. Instead, it was forecast to lose 10 seats to end up with 24. The result is the latest in a series of elections that is altering the European political landscape. From Slovakia and Spain, to Germany and Poland, populist and hard-right parties triumphed in some EU member nations and faltered in others. ___ Casert reported from Brussels.","Anti-Islam populist Geert Wilders won a huge victory in Dutchelections.

"A Ukrainian strike on a brand-new Russian cruise missile carrier in Crimea is likely to push Russia to consider moving its shipbuilding capacities further away from the front line, the UK's Ministry of Defence saidin an intelligence update on Tuesday. Saturday's strike at the Zaliv shipyardwas ""farther to the east in Crimea than most previous Ukrainian-claimed long-range strikes,"" the UK MOD said. And the strike will likely nudge some Russian capacities further away, it added. ""Ukraine's capability to hit Crimean shipbuilding infrastructure will likely cause Russia to consider relocating farther from the front line, delaying the delivery of new vessels,"" it said. On Monday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyycongratulated his armed forcesfor the attack on the shipyard, which is about four miles south of Crimea's Kerch Bridge. A spokesperson for Ukraine's air force, Yuriy Ihnat,named the damaged ship as the Askold, one of Russia's most advanced corvettes. The Askold is a Karakurst-class corvette — or small missile ship — that can carry up to eight Kalibr cruise missiles. The ship had yet to fire a single shot in action, Ihnat said. A fire burning at Zaliv Shipbuilding Yard in Kerch, Crimea after it was attacked by Ukrainian  fired missiles earlier today, the visible fire in the dock could possibly be a Karakurt-class ship burning after several Russian sources reported that it was hit by missilespic.twitter.com/XtbH1bZbL0 Russia's Ministry of Defence acknowledgeddamage to one of its ships from a missile barrage, without giving further details. A Ukrainian air force commander hinted that it was struck by a French-supplied SCALP missile, also known as aStorm Shadow missile. According to the UK MOD, the Askold had not yet joined the Black Sea Fleet, but pera Russian sitethat closely follows its developments, it had been poised to do so this year. The UK MOD's comments suggest that the impact of the attack is likely to go beyond the Askold's own fighting capacity. Moving shipbuilding activities would be a distinct problem for Russia's navy. It has alreadymoved a large number of vesselsfrom Sevastopol, the most advanced port at its disposal, followinga Ukrainian strike in Septemberthat dealt massive damage to a submarine and a landing craft. As of last month, much of the Black Sea Fleet was scattered to ports such as Novorossiysk and Fedosia, which have less advanced facilities and are much further away from the waters Russia aims to project power over. Experts have told Insiderthat as damages rack up, it could put a strain on Russia's ability to repair and maintain its fleet. Anddue to an international treaty enforced by Turkey,Russia cannot simply bring additional existing ships into the Black Sea. Ukraine's attacks on Crimea are designed to make Russia's continued occupation of the peninsula ""untenable,"" Ben Hodges, a former commander of US Army Europe,previously told Insider's Jake Epstein.","Ukrainian strike on Russian cruise missile carrier in Crimea likely to push Russia to move shipbuilding capacity further away from front line, UK says.

"Getting the right gifts for your pets can be just as tricky as shopping for humans. Thankfully, there are tons of Cyber Monday deals on pet gear and supplies right now, making it easier than ever to not only do your pet-centric holiday shopping but also to stock up on supplies. Megastore Chewy is having a hugesite-wide salethat's worth checking out, but we've also included some of our top picks on pet beds, treats, toys, and more. We test products year-round and handpicked these deals.The discounts we show are based on actual street prices at retailers in the past few months. Products that are sold out or no longer discounted as of publishing will becrossedout. We'll update this guide throughout the day. If you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission. This helps support our journalism.Learn more. Jump to Topic:Pet Cameras,Carriers and Beds,Litter Boxes,Pet DNA Tests,Pet Food Read ourBest Pet Camerasguide for more info and options. 2Furbo 360 Dog Camera Furbo's 360 Camera (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is ourfavorite for dogs. Spin it manually to find your furbaby or turn on auto-tracking. You can fling treats through the app or ask Alexa to do it for you. This deal is easier to understand directly from Furbo. If you bundle a camera with a Dog Nanny subscription for alerts and video history, you get a pretty solid discount. You'll have to choose between monthly for a minimum of three months, one year which comes out to $138 with the camera, or a two-year bundle for $198. Amazon has this deal too, but makes it seem like both the camera and subscription cost just one payment of $69. This is for the camera only, and you'll still have to set up the subscription through the Furbo app. If you want just the camera and don't want to remember to cancel the membership, that costs$145 ($65 off). You don't need a camera specifically for dogs or cats, and it's annoying that Furbo's new 360 Cat Camera costs more than the dog version. I've been testing it for a few months and it's nearly identical, but it has a feather wand toy on top to attract your cats. I do prefer the black casing versus white; it looks a little more sleek. Like the Furbo Dog Camera, you can bundle in the subscription for a much bigger discount—choose between $7 a month for a minimum of three months, a year for $69, or two years for $129—or pay for just the camera for$154 ($66 off). If you do the former, it's probably easier to just buy through Furbo, as you still have to set up a subscription if you pay the cheaper option from Amazon. Eufy Pet Camera D605 If you buy directly from Eufy, copy the on-screen codeWS24BFT7203to apply this discount. I used an older version of this camera (9/10, WIRED Recommends), sending my cats treats while I was away. I particularly liked the daily recap videos, AKA Doggy Diaries (we won't tell the cats it's called that), which condenses the day's antics into a 60-second clip. The version I tried, the D605, is alsoon sale for $130 ($70 off). We think it might be worth springing for this new model since it's only $16 more right now. It has 2K resolution versus 1080p, and it seems to rotate a full 360 degrees without stopping. The D605 can only spin 270 degrees to one side before having to go back around to catch the other 90 degrees. We've been testing this brand-new camera for the last few weeks. The design is unique, where the base spins around for 360-degree views, but the lens is a separate piece that lets you move it up and down too. When you turn it on privacy mode, it rotates all the way down so the lens is completely covered. We like a few of Petcube's cameras, but the app needs a revamp. It's slow, and sometimes just doesn't do what you want it to. But if you can deal with some frustrations, you'll get a camera for pretty cheap. Jump to Topic:Pet Cameras,Carriers and Beds,Litter Boxes,Pet DNA Tests,Pet Food Casper Medium Dog Bed Casper makesour favorite dog bed, which makes sense because it also makes one ofour favorite mattresses. There are several different sizes available, and the prices fluctuate often, but at least most are discounted right now—they're more expensivedirectly from Casper. The memory foam is thick but it's still low enough to the ground that even arthritic dogs should be OK using it. The cover is machine washable. Enter codeCYBER25at checkout if you're buying directly from the Diggs site. Diggs' Passenger carrier is pricey, but it's high-quality and this price matches the sale we saw during Prime Day. There are seat belt clips and a buckle strap, and a bunch of pockets for you to hold treats, or your keys or wallet. The material feels thick and durable and I get compliments every time I bring mycatsto the vet in it. Little Chonk The Maxine One Dog Backpack WIRED reviews editor Julian Chokkattu loves thisInstagram-famousbackpack (8/10, WIRED Recommends) for toting around his 17-pound dog. It may take some coaxing to get your pup in, but once they settled, they're secured safely to your back. You can use your hands for carrying groceries or ride the subway without issue. The Maxine One comes in two sizes, the smaller of which worked for Chokkattu's Tobu. You don't have to go full backpack to carry around your pet. Roverlund makes a few pet products we like, including this tote. It's soft, but base is stable and the thick straps stay on your shoulders better than a lot of tote bags. The side pocket is just very small, so it won't fit more than a few dog poop bags. This price is for the small size, the large is discounted to $111 ($48 off). If you're buying from Amazon, make sure to click the on-page coupon button, but it's still a few dollars more from there. We also loveRoverlund's Out-of-Office Carrierbut it isn't included in this sale as of this writing. Jump to Topic:Pet Cameras,Carriers and Beds,Litter Boxes,Pet DNA Tests,Pet Food Leo's Loo Too Automatic Litter Box The Leo's Loo Too (8/10 WIRED Recommends) jumped up $50 at the beginning of the year, so this sale brings it back down to the price it was when we tried it. Sale or not, automatic litter boxes are a huge investment but they take a lot of work out of the litter cleaning process. This one is nearly silent and not a single odor comes through the drawer until you actually open it—and then nose beware. The drum may be a little small for extra large cats. If you're going to get an automatic box, we recommend one like this from Casa Leo (formerly Smarty Pear) or aLitter-Robot, both of which include information like weight and bathroom habits in the app (if you aren't scooping everyday you might miss an important health signs like decreased or increased bathroom frequency). Litter-Robot is having sales on somebundles, but no device-only sales as of yet. The Petivity Monitor (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is a much cheaper way to get valuable health information about your cats than an automatic litter box. It sits under a normal box and after a brief training period, tracks when each cat goes to the bathroom, what they do there, and how much they weigh. If you cat isn't feeling well, you can bring that information right to the vet. The app can be glitchy sometimes and occasionally tells me that a cat entered the box but didn't go, even though I watched them. But the brand is regularly adding new features and updating it as it gets more popular. Archie & Oscar Rena Litter Box Enclosure The price of this seems to fluctuate frequently, and there are a few dollars difference between the colors, but this is still a pretty good deal on a nice piece of furniture that hides the litter box away. Inside is a place for a regular pan to sit, and a little entryway—a mudroom if you will—where you should put a mat to catch stray litter on the way out. There's enough headroom that most cats should be OK using it, but not every cat loves the privacy. WIRED writer Louryn Strampe uses this, and says it looks like a small credenza and most people don't even realize what's inside. This discount should be automatically applied in your cart. The Litter Genie is an amazing accessory if you don't want to be running garbage to the bins every day. Like a Diaper Genie, you scoop clumps into the top and pull the lever which drops the clumps into the bottom where it stays odor-free until it's time to empty it. There are smaller and cheaper ones, but this is a good size if you have multiple cats. It's compatible with the standard and jumbo size refills, but the latter lasts around fourish months depending on how much waste is going in there. They're also discounted to$8 ($12 off) with code PET50 at Chewy. Jump to Topic:Pet Cameras,Carriers and Beds,Litter Boxes,Pet DNA Tests,Pet Food Pet DNA tests are interesting but should be taken with a grain of salt. It's an unregulated industry, and results may vary. We haven't testeddog tests since 2019, but still, they're fun and can make great gifts for pet lovers in your life. Embark Dog DNA Breed and Health Test This test frequently drops from its $105 list price to $85, but this matches the lowest price we've seen this year. It'll screen for 365 plus brands and over 25 genetic health conditions, and you can even find your dog's relatives. You'll also get some fun physical traits predictions like if your pup is likely to have short legs or floppy ears. You have to swab your dog's mouth for 15 seconds two times, which is one less than when we originally tested, but still might be frustrating to Fido. For even more info, thePremium test for $112 ($48 off)tests for over 265 genetic conditions. Wisdom Panel also has acat DNA testthat we haven't tested, but we think it's likley similar. Embark was created as a spin-off of Cornell’s canine genomics initiative, and its test was the easiest to use—one swab instead of two! Results are packed with information and you can take several quizzes afterward for things like behavior and eating habits. Embark tests more genetic markers so your results should be more accurate and you'll get to see a family tree. It's also super pricey (theage testis $150onsale). Basepaws Breed + Health Cat DNA Test Basepaws is the only cat DNA test we've tried. It was thorough, delivering 70-plus pages of breed and health results and it's frequently discounted if you want to try it. Cat breed identification is a little bit harder, and at the end of the day, my cats are simply brown, black, and orange, but it was fun to learn a little bit more about them and be able to breathe a sigh of relief that no major diseases came up. I did, however, learn that Eely-Rue was at risk of periodontal disease and the vet confirmed her gums were a concern. We had a cleaning and will continue to monitor it. Jump to Topic:Pet Cameras,Carriers and Beds,Litter Boxes,Pet DNA Tests,Pet Food Lightweight and easy to maneuver, the Tineco Carpet One Pro is the upgrade pick on ourBest Carpet Cleanersguide. It’s lightweight, easy to maneuver, and has a drying mode that blows hot air at your carpet to help it dry out faster after cleaning. This carpet cleaner is the top pick on ourBest Carpet Cleanersguide. It cleans carpets so well that during testing, writer Medea Giordano said it felt like her whole house was renewed. It removed excess cat hair and obliterated any persistent odors. Chewy's sale encompases a ton of products like toys and accessories, but sometimes the most expensive thing we have to buy are the necessities like food and treats.

"Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Sunday said the “Sikh Panth has always played a leading role in the defence of the motherland” and that the sacrifice and dedication of Sikh Gurus inspired us all to protect our country and religion. Inaugurating an intersection inLucknow’s Alambagh locality that was renamed Khalsa Chowk to commemorate the Jyoti Jyot Diwas of Guru Gobind Singh, the tenth Sikh master and founder of the Khalsa Panth, Adityanath “took a dig at the Iftar parties organised in the Chief Minister’s Office during the tenure of theSamajwadi Partygovernment”. “But after the formation of theBJPgovernment in the state, a grand celebration of the 550th Prakash Parv of Guru Nanak Dev was organised in the CMO,” a statement by the state government quoted the Chief Minister. The intersection was previously known as Tedhi Pulia. Guru Gobind Singh established the Khalsa Panth in 1699 to protect the religion and culture of India from foreign invaders, the CM said, adding, “This Panth has always played a leading role in the defence of the motherland. The sacrifice and dedication of Sikh Gurus inspire us all to protect our country and religion.” Asserting that the lives of Sikh Gurus reminded us of the glorious saga of India, Adityanath paid tributes to the Sikh community’s tradition of sacrifice, dedication, devotion to religion, and service to society. “In the coming days, we will get the opportunity to participate in many programmes,” he said, referring to the martyrdom day of Guru Tegh Bahadur on November 24, Prakash Parv of Guru Nanak Dev on November 27 (on Kartik Purnima), and Birbal Day on December 26.",Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath said the ‘Sikh Panth has always played a leading role in the defence of the motherland’ He also took a dig at the Iftar parties organised in the Chief Minister’s Office during the tenure of theSamajwadi Partygovernment.,"On 26 August 2023, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath said the ‘Sikh Panth has always played a leading role in the defence of the motherland’ He also took a dig at the Iftar parties organised in the Chief Minister’s Office during the tenure of theSamajwadi Partygovernment.  “It was during the regime of the Samajwadi Party that such ‘Iftar’ parties were held in the office.

"The breakdown in the relationship with the US makes contacts even on an issue as vital as the strategic balance of power nearly impossible, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov has told the Izvestia newspaper. The last surviving bilateral nuclear arms reduction treaty is likely to expire, leading to a possible arms race, he predicted in an interview published on Wednesday. New START, the latest iteration of a series of agreements that limited Moscow’s and Washington's nuclear arsenals, was last renewed ‘as is’ in January 2021, days after Joe Biden was inaugurated as US president. Moscow suspended its participation in the agreement in February, citing US involvement in the Ukraine conflict and Kiev’s attacks on Russian air bases hosting strategic bombers. At this point, there is“no option”to continue New START or replace it, after it expires in February 2026, Ryabkov said. “We have to take into account the level of hostility of our opponents and their reckless drive to pump the Kiev regime with all kinds of weapons,”he explained, calling the situation“the opposite to what we’ve always aimed for.” Ryabkov suggested that people in Washington may be looking for a new arms race, similar to the one that President Ronald Reagan triggered with the Strategic Defense Initiative. His proposal was to create an advanced anti-ballistic missile system that could stop a Soviet nuclear strike – consequently exposing America’s Cold War opponent to an undeterred US attack. The technologies required for such a system were far from maturity, but the threat pushed Moscow to overextend military spending. If the Americans hope to repeat Reagan’s deception, they are wrong, Ryabkov said. “We will not fall for provocations, which are a feature of American politics on the Russian track; we will guarantee our security,”the diplomat promised. He also remarked that Russia sees no need for any treaties on nuclear weapons with China, considering that the two nations have reached a“perfect understanding on all issues.” “What we have is enough, and we are happy with it,”he noted. Officials from the administration of President Donald Trump claimed that they wanted a trilateral agreement with Russia and China to replace New START, when they argued against renewing it. They also cited a need to confront China, when the US announced in 2018 an intention to withdraw from the INF Treaty, another nuclear arms control treaty with Russia that banned both sides from fielding intermediate-range land-based missiles.","Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov says the last surviving nuclear arms reduction treaty is likely to expire.

"The BBC's flagship car show Top Gear will not return ""for the foreseeable future"" after presenter Andrew ""Freddie"" Flintoff was hurt in a crash while filming last year. In a statement, the BBC said it has ""decided to rest the UK show"". The presenter was injured in December at Top Gear's test track at Dunsfold Park Aerodrome in Surrey. The 34th series was subsequently halted and the BBC apologised to the former England cricketer. The BBC added it ""remains committed to Freddie, Chris and Paddy who have been at the heart of the show's renaissance since 2019, and we're excited about new projects being developed with each of them. We will have more to say in the near future on this.  ""We know resting the show will be disappointing news for fans, but it is the right thing to do. ""All other Top Gear activity remains unaffected by this hiatus including international formats, digital, magazines and licensing."" Flintoff recently reached a settlement with the BBC, reportedly worth £9m. The payout will not be funded by the TV licence fee, as BBC Studios is a commercial arm of the broadcaster. Last month, his legal team told the Sun newspaper that the former cricketer was still recovering from ""life-altering significant"" injuries. The BBC apologised to Flintoff in March over his injuries, as it announced a health and safety review of the show. It was expected to be undertaken by an independent third party. It reiterated that apology last month when the compensation to Flintoff was announced. BBC Studios said the external investigation report ""was concluded in March of this year and is not being published, which we have always made clear"". In a statement on a separate health and safety review, which did not cover Flintoff's accident, BBC Studios said: ""The independent Health and Safety production review of Top Gear, which looked at previous seasons, found that while BBC Studios had complied with the required BBC policies and industry best practice in making the show, there were important learnings which would need to be rigorously applied to future Top Gear UK productions."" ""The report includes a number of recommendations to improve approaches to safety as Top Gear is a complex programme-making environment routinely navigating tight filming schedules and ambitious editorial expectations - challenges often experienced by long-running shows with an established on and off screen team.  ""Learnings included a detailed action plan involving changes in the ways of working, such as increased clarity on roles and responsibilities and better communication between teams for any future Top Gear production.""   Flintoff was pictured for the first time since the accident in September, as he led fielding drills with England players in Cardiff ahead of the team's one-day international with New Zealand. Scars were visible on his face and he had tape on his nose. The 45-year-old former England captain retired from cricket in 2009 having played 79 Tests, 141 one-day internationals and seven T20s. He joined BBC One's Top Gear as a host in 2019 alongside Paddy McGuinness and Chris Harris. Their most recent series attracted an average audience of 4.5 million viewers.","Presenter Andrew ""Freddie"" Flintoff hurt in a crash while filming last year.

"MOSCOW --With pointed disdain for the West, Russia on Saturday unveiled a sprawling exposition highlighting the nation's accomplishments, which will run through the months leading to the presidentialelectionin which Vladimir Putin is widely expected to seek a new term. Putin issued a decree in March to hold the exposition and some observers have seen it as aimed at creating an ideological framework for his reelection. News reports had suggested he might use the opening to announce his candidacy for the March election, but his spokesman later said he would not attend the event. Putin has led Russia as president or prime minister since 2000, and reelection would extend his term until 2030. The event is held at VDNKh, the vast exposition grounds in northern Moscow that was established by Josef Stalin and is renowned for its collection of elaborate Soviet Gothic-style pavilions. The setting plays to many Russians' nostalgia for the Soviet era and echoes Putin's drive to restore Russia as a superpower. Thematically, the exposition focuses on Russia as a country of diverse ethnic groups and cultures unified by a sense of national purpose. It includes displays from each of Russia's regions, as well as from the Luhansk and Donetsk regions ofUkrainethat Russia claims to have annexed, along with an array of presentations on industry, education and technology will be on offer. It also draws on the view of Russia being in a civilizational battle, a concept that has been in forefront of official discourse since Russia sent troops into Ukraine in February 2022. “Any provocations and aggressive actions directed against Russia are doomed to failure. Because we are a single people, bound by a common history, fraternal bonds of friendship and mutual understanding,” Putin said in a message marking the opening of the exposition. In a speech at the show's opening day, Putin's close ally Nikolai Patrushev, head of the national security council, amplified the idea. ""In contrast to the West, Russia has offered a civilizational choice based on preserving national sovereignty, mutual respect, equal partnership, traditional family values, protection of religious foundations and the rights of believers, as well as generally accepted norms of morality, ethics and social behavior,” he said. “Historically, Russia has always been a bone in the throat of the West, interfering with the implementation of its hegemonic plans,” Patrushev said.","Putin issued a decree in March to hold the exposition.

"Milwaukee Brewers' Brandon Woodruff is douced as they celebrate after clinching the National League ... [+] Central Division after a baseball game against the St. Louis Cardinals Tuesday, Sept. 26, 2023, in Milwaukee. (AP Photo/Morry Gash) The number of players on the free agent market has grown. Following Friday night’s deadline for MLB teams to offer players contracts for next season, 63 joined the open market after being nontendered. Most of those players are fringe major-leaguers or second-tier prospects. However, some notable players were also set free. Here is a look at five who could generate a fair amount of interest. BRANDON WOODRUFF The two-time All-Star underwent shoulder surgery that could cause him to miss the 2024 season. Considering the right-hander is eligible for free agency at the end of next season, is no surprise that the Milwaukee Brewers decided to cut him loose rather than go through the arbitration process. Any team signing Woodruff will almost certainly give him a two-year contract. That way, he could spend next year rehabbing before returning to action in 2025. While Woodruff was limited to 11 starts this year, he was outstanding as he posted a 5-1 record and 2.28 ERA. The 30-year-old has gone 46-26 since breaking into the major leagues with the Brewers in 2017 with a 3.10 ERA in 130 games. AUSTIN MEADOWS It also wasn’t surprising that the Detroit Tigers nontendered the 28-year-old outfielder. He played in just 42 games the last two seasons because of anxiety and vertigo after the Tigers acquired him from the Tampa Bay Rays in a trade. Any team signing Meadows would take on some risk because of his mental health struggles. However, Meadows has also hit .259/.333/.472 with 70 home runs and 23 stolen bases in 417 career games over six big-league seasons. Meadows is still young enough to get his career back on track. He also has the pedigree of being an All-Star in 2019 with the Tampa Bay Rays and being the ninth overall pick in the 2013 draft by the Pittsburgh Pirates. JACOB STALLINGS Stallings had a miserable season at the plate for the Miami Marlins as the 33-year-old catcher had a .191/.278/.286 slash line with three home runs in 88 games. His defense was average as his zero defensive runs saved indicates. Yet Stallings is just two years removed from being the National League Gold Glove catcher in 2021 with the Pirates, a season in which he hit a career-high eight homers. Stallings had 21 DRS that season, but his defense slipped after going to the Marlins and he had minus-nine DRS in 2022. Stallings doesn’t provide much offensively, but he handles a pitching staff well. With the catcher market thin this winter, he should have suitors. SPENCER TURNBULL The right-hander has had his moments since breaking into the major leagues in 2018 with Detroit. However, the Tigers decided to cut ties with Turnbull after he made just 16 starts over the last three seasons because of injuries, including a torn elbow ligament that required Tommy John reconstructive surgery. Since throwing a no-hitter on May 18, 2021, against the Seattle Mariners, Turnbull has pitched only 10 times in the big leagues. The elbow injury a month later dashed a promising season two years after the Tigers stuck with Turnbull through a 3-17 rookie season. Turnbull is 31 and has that no-hitter on his resume. Some teams will view him as an intriguing reclamation project. DAKOTA HUDSON Speaking of reclamation projects, Hudson also fits that bill. The St. Louis Cardinals nontendered the right-hander after once considering him a prime building block for their starting rotation. Hudson is also a Tommy John survivor and hasn’t been the same since undergoing the surgery in 2020. He went 15-10 with a 4.55 ERA in 47 games in the succeeding three seasons. Hudson had a 6-3 record this past season but, that was deceiving since his ERA was 4.98 and he had just 45 strikeouts in 81 1/3 innings. However, at 29, he is still young enough to give teams hope they can turn his career around.","Following Friday night’s deadline for MLB teams to offer players contracts for next season, 63 joined the open market after being nontendered.

"An astronaut aboard the International Space Station snapped this astonishing photo in February of a massive skull peering up from a volcanic pit on Earth.

The cinder cones are thought to be relatively young in geological terms, likely forming within the past few million years and possibly as recently as the past few thousand years.

"Former Venture Partner at Versant Ventures and CEO of Inception, Versant’s San Diego Company Creation Engine, Brings Red Tree Strong Ties to San Diego Biopharmaceutical Ecosystem Addition of Dr. Caldwell Highlights Red Tree’s Strategic Prioritization of San Diego as Key West Coast Market for Sourcing Innovation to Drive Company Creation and Investment Red Tree Also Highlights Successful IPO for Portfolio Company, Cargo Therapeutics; Represents One of 2023’s Largest New Nasdaq Biotech Listings SAN FRANCISCO, Nov.  16, 2023  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Red Tree Venture Capital (“Red Tree”), a West Coast-centric, early stage-biased life science venture capital firm, today announced that Jeremy Caldwell, Ph.D., a widely respected biopharmaceutical executive and research and development leader, whose accomplishments span from the creation of innovative drug development companies to driving the discovery, development and translation of novel therapies, has joined the firm as a partner. Dr. Caldwell brings Red Tree a range of deep industry expertise built throughout a career involving roles as a member of both industry and the venture community. In alignment with the firm’s West Coast focus, he has forged deep ties within the San Diego and San Francisco Bay Area biotechnology communities. Based in San Diego, Dr. Caldwell’s addition to Red Tree illustrates the firm’s increased emphasis on targeting company creation and investment opportunities emanating from the greater San Diego area. This market has long served as a hotbed of academic entrepreneurs, life sciences talent, and pharma leadership, providing a fertile environment for Red Tree to expand its current operations beyond the Bay Area. Nicknamed “Biotech Beach,” San Diego is the third largest and fastest-growing biotech hub in the U.S. and home to such prestigious life sciences institutions as Scripps Research, the Salk Institute and the University of California, San Diego (UCSD). The area has a rich history in the formation of successful biopharmaceutical companies and these vibrant research institutes are producing a steady stream of transformative biomedical breakthroughs capable of continuing that tradition. “Jeremy has led an accomplished career in the biopharmaceutical space, achieving impressive successes from the perspectives of executive, R&D leader, and company builder. In his most recent role leading Inception, Versant Ventures’ San Diego-based company creation engine, he helped drive the establishment of various new biotech companies on the West Coast. His breadth of expertise, coupled with the deep relationships that he has established in the industry, position him as an ideal addition to Red Tree, particularly as we look to strategically expand our footprint,” said Heath Lukatch, co-founder and managing partner of Red Tree Venture Capital. “As a West Coast-centric venture firm, San Diego has always been high on our list of target markets within which to create a presence for sourcing the best and brightest local opportunities for developing first-in-class and/or best-in-class therapeutics and technologies. Jeremy’s strong and broad relationships in the San Diego biopharma ecosystem well position us to pursue our vision of establishing Red Tree as a leading venture firm serving this key Southern California geography.” “I am thrilled to join Red Tree and work alongside Heath, Jennifer Cochran, Red Tree co-founder and chief scientific advisor, and the rest of the team of talented individuals to further cement the firm as a premier West Coast venture group. Heath and I have a long-standing relationship dating back several decades. We share similar views on the immense potential of the biotechnology space to drive amazing innovations in human health, as well as the role that venture can play in supporting brilliant scientists and entrepreneurs who drive these innovations,” stated Dr. Caldwell. “In my experience, San Diego is home to a wealth of scientists and entrepreneurs, along with broad-reaching skilled life sciences talent and access to Big Pharma. This confluence of key factors highlights San Diego as a major player in the biopharma space and gives me great excitement for the position that Red Tree can establish within the San Diego ecosystem.” In his previous roles with Inception Therapeutics and Versant Ventures, Dr. Caldwell co-led in the formation of Chinook Therapeutics, which was acquired by Novartis in a deal valued at up to $3.5 billion, and co-led the investment and formation of Lycia Therapeutics, and Belharra Therapeutics, among others, acting as founding CEO and board director for each company. Prior to Inception/Versant, Dr. Caldwell was an entrepreneur-in-residence at Third Rock Ventures, where he participated in the genesis and formation of Revolution Medicines (RVMD), Pliant Therapeutics (PLRX), Decibel Therapeutics (DBTX), and Nurix Therapeutics (NRIX). He also played key roles in the foundational science on which Rigel, Inc. (RIGL), and Kalypsys, Inc., were formed, as well as advising in the build out of Syrrx, Inc., which was acquired by Takeda for approximately $270 million. With drug discovery and development expertise primarily focused on oncology, immunology, neurology and cardiometabolic disease, Dr. Caldwell is credited with significant contributions to research leading to four commercial drugs. During his career he has served as executive director of molecular and cellular biology, lead discovery and genomics at the Genomics Institute of the Novartis Research Foundation (GNF), vice president and head of RNA therapeutics at Sirna, lead discovery and protein sciences for Merck Research Laboratories, and executive vice president and chief scientific officer at Ardelyx, Inc. He currently serves as a member of the board of Red Tree portfolio companies Sardona Therapeutics and Biograph 55. In other firm news, Red Tree is proud to highlight the successful initial public offering (IPO) for Cargo Therapeutics, one of the firm’s portfolio companies. Red Tree has roots dating back to the beginning of Cargo Therapeutics, having participated as a co-investor in the company’s seed financing round. Since that initial investment, the firm co-led a $32 million bridge financing for Cargo and served as a co-investor in the company’s $200 million Series A funding round. Additionally, Dr. Lukatch was a Cargo board director prior to the company’s IPO. Cargo Therapeutic completed one of this year’s largest biotech IPOs on November 9, 2023, raising approximately $281 million and marking a significant milestone for Red Tree as the firm’s first IPO. About Red Tree Venture Capital Red Tree Venture Capital is a West Coast-centric, early stage-biased life science venture capital firm. The firm was founded on the idea that an untapped opportunity exists for a venture capital firm guided by a targeted strategy of leveraging deep relationships with leading West Coast academic and research institutions to source innovation emerging from those organizations. Red Tree Venture Capital has raised an inaugural $272 million fund, Red Tree Venture Capital Fund I, to create and invest in companies developing first-in-class and/or best-in-class therapeutics and technologies in the areas of oncology, neurology and immunology.

"European Commission Speech16 November 2023Brussels Dear Ministers,State Secretary,Mayor Close,Mayor Klitschko, Let me begin by thanking the City of Brussels for once again hosting the Kyiv Investment Forum. Since the start of Russia's war of aggression, over 60,000 Ukrainians have received their European temporary protection in this city. Brussels has also sent to Kyiv City Hospital over 300,000 euros worth in medical equipment, a powerful generator, and 6 fully equipped ambulances. These remarkable acts of solidarity have been multiplied by cities across our Union, with cities in Ukraine. Like in Lviv, where Brussels and others support the largest care centre in Ukraine for wounded civilians and soldiers. The centre is called ""Unbroken"". And so is Europe's solidarity and Ukraine's resistance. Today, we're gathered here to discuss the future of Ukraine in the European Union. In particular, the sustainable revival of greater Kyiv. Mayor Vitali Klitschko, your city and its people have become synonymous with resilience. You've sheltered tens of thousands of internally displaced Ukrainians. You've countered Russian missiles against your energy and civilian infrastructure. You were besieged by Russian tanks. In Bucha, I saw the body bags laying on the street. But your city and your nation fought back. You won the Battle of Kyiv, and you will win the war for Ukraine! I saw Ukraine's determination again two weeks ago, during my latest visit to your country. Once again, I was so inspired by Ukraine's confidence in a better future. And while fighting a full-scale war, Ukraine is also passing deep and bold reforms. You have completed almost all of the steps we asked you to take. The constitutional justice reform. The selection of the High Council of Justice. The Anti-Corruption Program. Progress against money-laundering. Important measures to curb the oligarchs' grip on your public life. Just to name a few. The good news is, that the remaining measures are already on their way. Therefore, the Commission recommends the start of accession negotiations to the Council. Your reforms will make Ukraine stronger and more attractive for investors. If you stay the course at your impressive pace, the future of Ukraine is in the European Union. And we want to underpin Ukraine's reforms with European investments. This is why we are working on a 50-billion-euro financial and reform package. It will support Ukraine's National Plan, to rebuild the country. And the Ukraine Plan can also provide guidance and coordination for international donors, both public and private. Ukraine wants to become a hub of green industry and digital innovation. It has the people and the will to make this happen. So let's invest together in their European future. The city of Kyiv is leading this effort to build a better future for Ukraine. I have seen first hand how the city is reimagining itself, as a dynamic, green, and inclusive capital. Kyiv can also be an example for other Ukrainian cities, as well as for cities in the EU. We can learn so much from each other, and help one another. Including through the ""mayor's platform"", which this forum brought to life last year. Now, with the winter coming, we must all re-double our efforts in support of Ukraine. From healthcare and energy support to protecting Ukraine's rich cultural heritage, every action matters. Europe stands with Ukraine, this winter, and all seasons to come. Slava Ukraini.Long live Europe.","Since the start of Russia's war of aggression, over 60,000 Ukrainians have received their European temporary protection in this city.

"Moscow: Russian President Putintold leaders of the Group of Twenty (G20) Wednesday that it was necessary to think about how to stop ""the tragedy"" of the war in Ukraine, some of his most placatory remarks to date about the conflict. Addressing G20 leaders for the first time since the start of the war, Putin said some leaders had said in their speeches they were shocked by the ongoing ""aggression"" of Russia in Ukraine.""Yes, of course, military actions are always a tragedy,"" Putin told leaders.""And of course, we should think about how to stop this tragedy,"" he said. ""By the way, Russia has never refused peace talks with Ukraine.""The remark, although clearly intended for international consumption, is one of Putin's most dovish on the war for months and contrasts with his sometimes long diatribes about the failings and arrogance of the US.Putin used the word ""war"" to describe the conflict instead of the current Kremlin term of ""special military operation"". ""I understand that this war, and the death of people, cannot but shock,"" Putin said, before setting out the Russian case that Ukraine had persecuted people in eastern Ukraine. ""And the extermination of the civilian population in Palestine, in the Gaza Strip today, is not shocking?"" Putin asked.Putin skipped previous G20 summits in New Delhi and Nusa Dua, Indonesia, sending foreign minister Sergei Lavrov instead. He addressed the 2021 and 2020 summits from Moscow.

"us corporations aremaking more stuff in america. but fewer made-in-china product labels will likely also mean higher prices for americans at the checkout line. that's according to anew paperfrom jpmorgan, which explored how us efforts toreduce supply chain dependency on chinacould impact consumer prices in the years ahead. while these efforts shouldcreate us jobs, there's a potential downside for americans. given it's generallymore expensivetomanufacture goodsin the us than china, shoppers could have to pay more for made-in-americaitems likeclothes, toys, and furniture. ""no plausible path for us-china trade should put downward pressure on us inflation comparable to what was observed during the 2000s,"" the authors wrote. however, jpmorgan researchers found that the inflationary impact of doing less business with china will likely be relatively small in the near term — up to 10 to 20 basis points each year between now and 2032.that's the equivalent of a 3.0% annual inflation figure being 3.1% or 3.2%. efforts to ""friend shore"" — or shift some manufacturing and trade tous allies like mexico— could help offset some price pressures. since the turn of the century,cheaper overseas manufacturing costsin countries like china have driven down us prices for goods like smartphones, tvs, and computers. even for companies that continued to make goods in the us, buying supplies from overseas helped keep prices down. between 2000 and 2010, the surge in chinese imports reduced us inflation by roughly 40 basis points per year, jpmorgan's researchers said, relative to a more modest import growth scenario. but times have changed and recent global factors have pushed us corporations tobring their supply chains closer to home. these events include pandemic-erasupply chain nightmares, russia's invasion of ukraine, and chinese national security and human rights concerns. the ongoing war betweenisrael and hamascould expedite these efforts. last year, 364,000 jobs were ""reshored"" in the us, according to areportby the reshoring initiative, a non-profit that tracks manufacturing data, and whose mission is to bring high-paying jobs back to the us. this number, which was up 53% from 2021's record-highfigure, included jobs that had been previously done in other countries and those created in the us by foreign-owned corporations. more jobs could be on the way. construction spending by us manufacturersmore than doubledbetween june 2022 and april 2023, according to census bureau data. us shoppers aren't the only ones who should be closely monitoring the impacts of reshoring, jpmorgan's paper reported. that's because higher prices could make it more difficult for thefederal reserve to cool inflation. ""if the fed lacks the ability or willingness to anticipate and neutralize the effect of this supply shock, it could lead to higher inflation,"" the report said. even if reshoring has a modest impact on inflation over the next year, every little bit matters in the fed's fight to hit its long-term2% inflation target. ""inflation is still too high, and a few months of good data are only the beginning of what it will take to build confidence that inflation is moving down sustainably toward our goal,"" federal reserve president jerome powell said to the economic club of new york last week. if the fed anticipates these price pressures and keeps interest rates higher for longer, this could help keep inflation in check. but even this could have a downside for americans. higher interest rates are making it difficult for many people tobuy a homeandmeet their car payments. ""monetary policy could be more restrictive than otherwise for the duration of the shock,"" the report said.","Jpmorgan: Fewer made-in-china product labels will likely also mean higher prices for americans at the checkout line.

"Agencies From  Hamas 's brutal attacks in  Israel , and the fierce retribution it provoked, to the kiss that caused a revolt in Spanish football, here are 10  events  that marked a tumultuous 2023: -  Israel-Gaza war  - On October 7, hundreds of Hamas gunmen pour across the border from  Gaza , killing around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking about 240 people hostage in the worst attack in Israel's history, traumatising the country and stunning the world.  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vows to ""destroy"" Hamas and Israel launches air bombardments followed by a ground offensive that reduces entire neighbourhoods in the densely packed Palestinian territory to rubble. As Gaza's destruction and death toll mount, international pressure grows on Israel to pause its offensive. Seven weeks into the war, the two sides agree to a four-day truce. Gaza's Hamas-run government estimates around 13,000 Palestinians have been killed, mostly civilians and including thousands of children.  Hamas releases 50 women and child hostages in return for 150 Palestinian prisoners, all women and minors, leading to emotional reunions. On November 27, the two sides agree to extend the ceasefire by two days. - Ukraine's laboured fightback - Sixteen months after Russia invaded its neighbour, Kyiv launches a highly anticipated counteroffensive after amassing billions in powerful Western-made weapons and training new recruits. But the pushback fails to make much of a dent in Russia's deep defensive lines. In late November, Ukraine announces it has made inroads along the Russian-held left bank of the Dnipro River, its first major success in months.  But as winter sets in, both sides still appear largely dug in. - Devastating quakes - In the early hours of February 6, one of the deadliest earthquakes in a century flattens entire cities in southeast Turkey, killing at least 56,000 people, with nearly 6,000 others killed across the border in Syria. Two images come to define the devastating 7.8-magnitude tremor: that of a father holding the hand of his dead 15-year-old daughter, protruding from under a collapsed building in Kahramanmaras, the epicentre, and that of a newborn baby rescued from the rubble while still umbilically attached to her dead mother. Seven months later, on September 8, Morocco suffers the deadliest quake in its history, centred on the Atlas mountains. Nearly 3,000 people are killed. - More coups in Africa -   The spate of coups that have marked a brutal democratic backsliding in francophone Africa continues in 2023, with Niger and Gabon the latest countries to overthrow an elected president. An unpopular France is forced to withdraw both its ambassador and counter-terrorism troops from Niger -- the third time its forces are sent packing by a former African colony in under two years. In August, meanwhile, Gabon's president Ali Bongo Ondimba, heir to a dynasty that ruled for 55 years, is deposed after a presidential election which the army and opposition declared fraudulent. - Hollywood on strike -  The existential dread caused by generative AI in the creative economy spreads to Hollywood in 2023, where writers go on strike in May to demand curbs on the use of the technology in films as well as a pay rise. Hollywood actors join the biggest work stoppage in Tinseltown since the 1960s in July, saying that it has become almost impossible to earn a decent living for non A-listers and fear AI could be used to clone their voices and likenesses. The strike cripples the entertainment industry and delays hundreds of popular shows and films before the studios and actors agree a deal in November, two months after the writers went back to work. - Deadly fires -   The year goes out with a sizzle, with the European Union's climate monitor predicting 2023 will be the hottest on record. Drought made worse by climate change was cited as one of several factors behind the deadliest wildfire in the US in a century that claimed at least 115 lives on the Hawaiian island of Maui in August. Tourists and residents also fled huge fires on the Greek islands of Rhodes and Corfu but the worst-affected country, in terms of area consumed by fire, was Canada, with over 18 million hectares of forest going up in smoke. -  Moon , the new frontier -   The space race heats up in 2023, with rising star India becoming the first nation to successfully land an unmanned craft on the Moon's south pole in August, just days after a Russian lunar vehicle crashed into its surface. Over half a century after US astronaut Neil Armstrong became the first man to walk on the moon, several countries are jostling to return humans to the celestial body. NASA is aiming for a crewed mission by 2025, China for 2030 and India for 2040. - Forced Spanish kiss - Spain's victory over England in the women's football World Cup final in Sydney on August 20 triggers scenes of wild rejoicing at home. But the euphoria quickly gives way to outrage when Spanish football chief Luis Rubiales is caught planting a kiss on the lips of captain Jenni Hermoso minutes after the game -- a kiss she says later she saw as ""an assault"". A defiant Rubiales insists the kiss was consensual but faced with a huge outcry, he eventually resigns. - Caucasus exodus - The breakaway republic of Nagorno-Karabakh winds up its three-decade push for independence in September after being recaptured by Azerbaijan in a lightning offensive that empties the mountainous region of most of its ethnic Armenian population. Karabakh residents flee to Armenia, fearing violence and not wanting to be ruled by Turkic-speaking Azerbaijanis with whom ethnic Armenian separatists fought two wars over the territory since the 1990s.  - Argentina lurches right -   In November, Argentina lurches to the right with the election of libertarian wild card candidate, Javier Milei, on a promise to ""blow up"" the central bank, dollarise the economy, privatise health and education and hold a vote on repealing abortion laws. The economist and TV pundit known for his foul-mouthed rants against the political ""caste"" rides a wave of fury over decades of economic decline and double-digit inflation under the long-dominant Peronist (centre-left) coalition. His vow to return Argentina to its ""golden age"" at the dawn of the 20th century draws comparisons with former US president Donald Trump's ""Make America Great Again"" slogan.

"US President Biden calls Xi Jinping a dictator; China hits back U.S.  President  Joe Biden  said on Wednesday he had not changed his view that Chinese President  Xi Jinping  was effectively a  dictator , a comment likely to land with a thud in  Beijing  after the two leaders held straightforward summit talks after months of preparation.  Biden held a solo news conference after four hours of talks with Xi on the outskirts of  San Francisco . At the end of the news conference, he was asked whether he still held the view that Xi was a dictator, something he said in June.   ""Look, he is. He's a dictator in the sense that he's a guy who runs a country that is a communist country that's based on a form of government totally different than ours,"" Biden said.  Last March Xi clinched a third term as president when nearly 3,000 members of  China 's rubber-stamp parliament, the National People's Congress, voted unanimously for him in an election in which there was no other candidate.   Xi is considered the most powerful Chinese leader since Mao Zedong, after a decade of consolidating power in policy-making and the military, and stifling media freedoms.   There was no immediate reaction from the Chinese delegation, which had come to the United States to attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in San Francisco. Hundreds of critics of Beijing marched through the city's downtown around noon, chanting ""free Tibet"" and ""free Hong Kong.""  When Biden made a similar dictator reference in June, China called the remarks absurd and a provocation. But the spat did not prevent the two sides from holding extensive talks aimed at improving strained relations, which culminated in Wednesday's meeting.  Still, Biden's opinion of the Communist Party was a topic of the Wednesday meeting. Xi told Biden that the negative views of the Communist Party in the United States were unfair, a U.S. official told reporters after the meeting.   Xi-Biden meet: 'Resuming military ties, aiming better coordination with China', says  POTUS 'Resuming military ties... aiming better coordination with China', says US President Joe Biden after meeting his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping.

The Secretary General emphasised that cyber is driving strategic competition and that authoritarian regimes, including China and Russia, are: ""challenging our interests, our values and our security."" He said they are: ""determined to shape the future of cyberspace in [their] own image with little transparency and no regard for human rights."" At the Vilnius Summit this year, Allies agreed to enhance NATO's cyber defence politically, militarily, and technically. To ""avoid relying on equipment supplied by authoritarian regimes to build our digital backbone for the future,"" the Secretary General said NATO must collaborate with the private sector to build resilience. Mr Stoltenberg reiterated that ""without industry, there is no defence, no deterrence and no security."" He thanked Germany for its leadership on cyber issues and for hosting the conference. Cyber is part of NATO's core task of deterrence and defence and Russia's war against Ukraine has highlighted the use of cyber in modern conflict.

To get out of this, the BJP has turned to their most reliable leader Asaduddin Owaisi. They proclaim themselves to be pure as they have declared a war against corruption.

Partha Chattopadhyay (another jailed TMC Minister) has learnt now. SSKM is a five-star hotel for them. It has become a refuge for thieves.

Police arrested 118 people on the day of the race, after the disruption saw it start 14 minutes later than its scheduled time. Nine people have been charged with wilful obstruction of a highway while a 10th person has been charged with stopping/causing a vehicle to remain at rest on a carriageway of a motorway.

"On Thursday, trades handled by the world’s largest bank in the globe’s biggest market traversed Manhattan on a USB stick. Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd.’s U.S. unit had been hit by a cyberattack, rendering it unable to clear swathes of U.S. Treasury trades after entities responsible for settling the transactions swiftly disconnected from the stricken systems. That forced ICBC to send the required settlement details to those parties by a messenger carrying a thumb drive as the state-owned lender raced to limit the damage. The workaround — described by market participants — followed the attack by suspected perpetrator Lockbit, a prolific criminal gang with ties to Russia that has also been linked to hits on Boeing Co., ION Trading U.K. and the U.K.’s Royal Mail. The strike caused immediate disruption as market-makers, brokerages and banks were forced to reroute trades, with many uncertain when access would resume. The incident spotlights a danger that bank leaders concede keeps them up at night — the prospect of a cyber attack that could someday cripple a key piece of the financial system’s wiring, setting off a cascade of disruptions. Even brief episodes prompt bank leaders and their government overseers to call for more vigilance. Read More:A New Generation of Bank Robbers Infiltrates Global Finance “This is a true shock to large banks around the world,” said Marcus Murray, the founder of Swedish cybersecurity firm Truesec. “The ICBC hack will make large banks around the globe race to improve their defenses, starting today.” As details of the attack emerged, employees at the bank’s Beijing headquarters held urgent meetings with the lender’s U.S. division and notified regulators as they discussed next steps and assessed the impact, according to a person familiar with the matter. ICBC is considering seeking help from China’s Ministry of State Security in light of the risks of potential attack on other units, the person said. Late Thursday, the bank confirmed it had experienced a ransomware attack a day earlier that disrupted some systems at its ICBC Financial Services unit. The company said it isolated the affected systems and that those at the bank’s head office and other overseas units weren’t impacted, nor was ICBC’s New York branch. The extent of the disruption wasn’t immediately clear, though Treasury market participants reported liquidity was affected. The Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, or Sifma, held calls with members about the matter Thursday. ICBC FS offers fixed-income clearing, Treasuries repo lending and some equities securities lending. The unit had $23.5 billion of assets at the end of 2022, according to its most recent annual filing with U.S. regulators. The attack is only the latest to snarl parts of the global financial system. Eight months ago, ION Trading U.K. — a little-known company that serves derivatives traders worldwide — was hit by a ransomware attack that paralyzed markets and forced trading shops that clear hundreds of billions of dollars of transactions a day to process deals manually. That has put financial institutions on high alert. ICBC, the world’s largest lender by assets, has been improving its cybersecurity in recent months, highlighting increased challenges from potential attacks amid the expansion of online transactions, adoption of new technologies and open banking. Read More:How China Became a Global Lender of Last Resort “The bank actively responded to new challenges of financial cybersecurity, adhered to the bottom line for production safety and deepened the intelligent transformation of operation and maintenance,” ICBC said in its interim report in September. Ransomware attacks against Chinese firms appear rare in part because China has banned crypto-related transactions, according toMattias Wåhlén, a threat intelligence specialist at Truesec. That makes it harder for victims to pay ransom, which is often demanded in cryptocurrency because that form of payment provides more anonymity. But the latest attack likely exposes weaknesses in ICBC’s defenses, Wåhlén said. “It appears ICBC has had a less effective security,” he said, “possibly because Chinese banks have not been tested as much as their Western counterparts in the past.” Ransomware hackers have become so prolific that attacks may hit record levels this year. Blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis had recorded roughly $500 million of ransomware payments through the end of September, an increase of almost 50% from the same period a year earlier. Ransomware attacks surged 95% in the first three quarters of this year, compared with the same period in 2022, according to Corvus Insurance. In 2020, the website of the New Zealand Stock Exchange was hit by a cyberattack that throttled traffic so severely that it couldn’t post critical market announcements, forcing the entire operation to shut down. It was later revealed that more than 100 banks, exchanges, insurers and other financial firms worldwide were targets of the same type of so-called DDoS attacks simultaneously. Caesars Entertainment Inc., MGM Resorts International and Clorox Co. are among companies that have been hit by ransomware hackers in recent months. Read More:This Company Was Hit With a Devastating Ransomware Attack—But Instead of Giving In, It Rebuilt Everything ICBC was struck as the Securities and Exchange Commission works to reduce risks in the financial system with a raft of proposals that include mandating central clearing of all U.S. Treasuries. Central clearing platforms are intermediaries between buyers and sellers that assume responsibility for completing transactions and therefore prevent a default of one counterparty from causing widespread problems in the marketplace. The incident underscores the benefits of central clearing in the $26 trillion market, said Stanford University finance professor Darrell Duffie. “I view it as one example of why central clearing in the U.S. Treasuries market is a very good idea,” he said, “because had a similar problem occurred in a not-clearing firm, it’s not clear how the default risk that might result would propagate through the market.”","ICBC was unable to clear swathes of U.S. Treasury trades after entities responsible for settling the transactions swiftly disconnected from the stricken systems.

"As the voting window for the Oscar shortlists approaches, Academy members are consideringKaouther Ben Hania’s filmFour Daughtersin not one, but two categories: Best Documentary FilmandBest International Feature. In August, Tunisia selected Ben Hania’s documentary as its official entry for International Film, the third time the director has been chosen for that honor, following 2017’sBeauty and the Dogsand 2020’sThe Man Who Sold His Skin, which went on to earn an Oscar nomination. Both of those earlier films were narrative dramas, and there are dramatic elements inFour Daughters: Ben Hania enlisted three actresses to participate in her documentary. Four Daughterstells the story of Olfa, a working-class Tunisian woman who raised four girls: Ghofrane, Rahma, Eya, and Tayssir. After the Arab Spring led to the ouster of Tunisia’s dictator in 2011, Islamic fundamentalism surged in the country. Olfa’s eldest – teenagers Ghofrane and Rahma – were swept up in the religious fervor and disappeared in 2015. Only later did it emerge they had joined ISIS in Libya and had been married off to militant leaders. The case attracted huge attention in Tunisia and elsewhere (not least because of the beauty of Olfa’s daughters; in the film, Islamist men are heard swooning over Ghofrane after she adopted fundamentalist garb, her dark eyes neatly framed by the black niqab). “Olfa did TV and radio interviews to tell the story of her daughters. I heard an interview with her on the radio and I was like, ‘I want to make a movie about it,’” Ben Hania recalls. “I contacted the journalist, and he gave me her number. It was like an impulse.” That was back in 2016. The director says she became close to Olfa, Eya and Tayssir over the next several years, but struggled to find the best way to document their experience. “In the beginning, I thought that I’ll do, I don’t know if I can call it a straightforward documentary, but kind of ‘fly on the wall’ documentary, filming Olfa and her two daughters in their home, thinking about the two other daughters,” Ben Hania tells Deadline. “But I realized quickly — and that’s why the project took so many years to come to life — that with this approach, I will not get to the multilayered dimension of the story.” She settled on an approach more in line with her background in narrative. “When you think about the past in general, in classical documentary, you think about reenactment, and I hate reenactment. So, I told myself, it’s such a cliché, I will hack it,” she remembers thinking. “I’ll use reenactment, but as I want it, and to serve the story.” Ben Hania engaged two young actresses to play the missing daughters, and Hend Sabri, a star of Middle Eastern cinema, to play the compelling Olfa. The concept was not to fictionalize the story, but quite the opposite – to use the methods and process of acting to explore the truth of what the family had gone through. “I know that actors are very good asking questions about character,” Ben Hania explains. “So, I told myself, when the actors meet with the real characters, they will be confronted with the reality, they will ask questions, they will react. The main idea was to insert cinema tools in the film to have a global vision, more kaleidoscopic vision for such a complex topic, such complex life, such complex characters.” Instead of a conventional documentary talking head interview, we learn about Olfa and her daughters through their interactions with the actors. “The idea wasn’t only to summon the past to bring it to life, but also to question it,” Ben Hania says, “to ask Olfa and her daughter’s questions and to give them the possibility to reflect on it too.” Olfa speaks of growing up poor — how she became a weightlifter in her youth, to fight off any men who might try to sexually assault her mom or sisters. She describes battling her husband, who seemed to regard her as property, and later divorcing him. That left Olfa to raise four girls on her own. Consistent with a culture preoccupied with the “purity” of girls and women, Olfa admits to fretting constantly that her daughters would become “whores” (a rather elastic term that, to her, encompassed flirting with boys). When Ghofrane entered a goth phase early in her teens, Olfa beat the girl so severely with a broom handle she thought she had killed her. These harsh anecdotes do not endear Olfa to the woman who plays her – Sabri. In the film, Sabri tells Olfa to her face that she’s alarmed by what she did to her kids. “Hend is very rational. She says what she thinks, and she told me, ‘I don’t like Olfa’s character,’” Ben Hania says. “It was really interesting to see them interact, and it was very rich for the movie and to understand better Olfa’s character.” That character, forged in a male-dominated culture, must be seen in context, Ben Hania says. “It’s a movie with women and they are strong women. Olfa is very strong. She doesn’t respect men. She’s not the kind of woman that will fear a man,” Ben Hania notes. But ironically – perhaps tragically would be a better word – Olfa could not avoid reproducing the mindset in which she was raised. “She’s like the guardian of patriarchy. And you have women like this, they perpetuate the patriarchy codes. We know that patriarchy is something that exists all over the world. We know that religion, and especially monotheistic religions, are very patriarchal. But also there is the common culture of patriarchy that is very, very old.” The youngest two, Eya and Tayssir, express determination not to repeat their mother’s patterns. “When her daughters say they are trying to stop this malediction,” Ben Hania observes, “I think they’re talking about patriarchy.” Ben Hania, along with Olfa, her daughters Eya and Tayssir and the cast of actors attended the Cannes Film Festival, whereFour Daughterspremiered in competition. (Ghofrane and Rahma remain imprisoned in Libya, where they were apprehended and tried for joining ISIS; Ghofrane has been raising a child behind bars). Ben Hania says it was never her intention to make a separate fictionalized version of the family’s story. The reenactments she filmed were always in service of getting to the heart of what they experienced, in nonfiction form. “The main idea,” she says, “was let’s engage together with the actresses in this process and to see what will happen.”","Kaouther Ben Hania’s filmFour Daughters was selected as Tunisia's official entry for International Film in August.

"Earlier this morning, ESA released the Euclid space telescope’s first scientific images, offering a glimpse into its mission to explore the “dark universe”—the mysterious 95% of the cosmos made up of dark matter and dark energy. The five images were chosen for their scientific value and public appeal, as the ESA team naturally wants to debut the telescope’s capabilities with a bang. For almost 14 billion years, the universe has seen phases of brightness and darkness. Its accelerating expansion, driven by the enigmatic “dark energy,” is a puzzle that the Euclid mission aims to solve. Euclid will also probe dark matter, an invisible substance only detectable by its gravitational effects, such as bending light from distant sources—a process known as gravitational lensing. You can see the telescope’s first images in the following slides and on the ESA website. Final fine-tuning of Euclid is now taking place and routine scientific observations are expected to begin in early 2024.",The Euclid space telescope has released its first scientific images.

"Binance and Changpeng Zhao (CZ) struck a settlement deal with the U.S. government in a bid to continue the crypto exchange's operation and end the years-long investigations by several agencies and regulators into the firm and its executives. However, days before the historic settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice, Binance transferred $3.9 billion in Tether between its wallets, raising suspicions in the cryptocurrency industry. Binance and its CEO Zhao pleading guilty to the allegations by the U.S. government helps explain why the exchange has been moving billions worth of stablecoins in the weeks leading to the finalization of the settlement with the U.S. government. The $3.9 billion USDT transaction, which was completed on Nov. 9, is within the range of the $4.3 billion that Binance is required to pay as part of the settlement agreement. The funds were moved from the Binance cold wallet (Binance-Cold 2) into Binance 3, another wallet of the exchange. Binance moved $3.9 billion$USDTfrom its cold to hot wallets a few days ago.https://t.co/AY4gS9wlISpic.twitter.com/QnnWKwChsC On-chain data revealed that the Binance 3 wallet currently holds around $6.6 billion in funds, with $4 billion in USDT and the rest in different stablecoins like Decentraland USD (USDD) and TrueUSD (TUSD). So far, it is unclear if Binance reserves the funds in that particular wallet for its payment to the settlement agreement or if it intends to use the funds for other matters. In the past, Binance mentioned that its cold wallets held the bulk of the company's funds. Earlier this week, it was reported that Binance is in discussion with the U.S. Justice Department for a potential settlement that includes over $4 billion in fines. In a federal court in Seattle on Tuesday, Zhaopleadedguilty to violating the Bank Secrecy Act and anti-money laundering and U.S. sanctions violations. As part of the settlement deal, Zhao had to resign from his post as the CEO of Binance, which he confirmed in a post on X on the same day. He also introduced Richard Teng as his replacement. ""Today, I stepped down as CEO of Binance. Admittedly, it was not easy to let go emotionally. But I know it is the right thing to do. I made mistakes, and I must take responsibility. This is best for our community, for Binance, and for myself,"" Zhaosaid. As part of the settlement agreement, Binance needs to pay a $4.3 billion fine, while Zhao is required to pay a $50 million fine. The settlement agreement included the Justice Department, Treasury Department and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), bringing an end to their years-long investigation of the exchange.","Binance struck a settlement deal with the U.S. government in a bid to continue the crypto exchange's operation and end the years-long investigations.

"Govee is my favorite lighting brand; I used most of its products over the last two years, and they've all been great. What I like the most is that its products always deliver a good value, and they work seamlessly. I have a lot of smart lighting products in my home, and until Govee came along, it was always a hassle to integrate these products with Google Assistant or Alexa. There are no such issues with Govee — if anything, the brand goes out of its way to give users customization options. I set up Govee with the DIY Home Assistant dashboard, and the lights even work with Elgato's Stream Deck. That brings me to the Glide Hexa Pro light panels; I got started with these nearly six months ago, and they're fantastic.  They have a 3D design that looks fabulous, and they're highly customizable. If you're looking to pick up some wall lighting, I cannot recommend these highly enough, and they're down to just $119, an $80 discount. Govee Glide Hexa Pro Light Panels (10-Pack): $199 $119 at Amazon Govee's The Glide Hexa Pro light panels are straightforward to install, highly customizable, and the 3D lighting effect is outstanding. These are the best light panels you can get at the moment, and considering what you're paying, you are getting a great value.   The standard Glide Hexa Pro kits contains 10 panels, and Govee sent over two kits for testing. These lights are inherently easy to set up, and you can plan what configuration you intend to use in the app, and it will guide you on how to set them up on the wall. Installation is very easy — it took about 30 minutes to come up with a design and install the lights — the light panels have strong adhesive at the back (they're still attached after six months), and routing the cables that connect the panels was a breeze. You can customize the lighting effects endlessly; Govee's mobile app has a ton of custom effects, and you can even use a music sync mode that changes the lighting dynamically according to whatever music is playing in the room. And like I said before, they integrate seamlessly with Google Assistant and Alexa. In short, these are the only wall lighting panels you need to consider, and now that they're down to $119, you're getting a great bargain.","Govee's Glide Hexa lights work with Google Assistant and Alexa.

"Infosys founder NR Narayana Murthy has lauded the Narendra Modi government’s National Education Policy (NEP), calling it an “excellent idea”. Commending the Modi government for the NEP, Murthy in an interview with ET, highlighted the need for a deeper focus on fostering invention and innovation within the Indian mindset. To achieve this, efforts must extend beyond the surface level to encompass primary and secondary education, he said.Murthy said that almost every developed nation leverages inventions and ongoing innovations to enhance citizens' lives and maintain low unemployment rates.Cultivating a pro-invention mindset is crucial for India to replicate these successes, he believes. Encouraging young individuals to generate innovative ideas will result in job creation which in turn will propel India toward reducing unemployment, he said.“I congratulate the Modi government for thinking of this National Education Policy. It's an excellent idea, in the right step,” Murthy said. “But as I pointed out, this process of making the Indian mind embrace invention and innovation, even more than what we do today, requires us to work not just at the superstructure level, but also at the primary and secondary school level,” Murthy explained.Asked about how states have been ambiguous about the adoption of NEP, Murthy said that it's essential not to let skepticism from some people deter us from pursuing new ideas. “I have no doubt at all that those people too have the best intention for India, they are also as patriotic as you and me. Therefore, our job is to sit down with such people, provide data and facts to them and very gently and courteously sell them the value of NEP. I have not come across a single Indian politician who is not interested in making India a better place,” he said.Should Indians heed Infosys founder Narayana Murthy’s call and work 70 hours a week? Here’s the social media verdictAccording to the veteran, India should look to train its retired teachers. Murthy is of the view that investment in training retired teachers can play a pivotal role in shaping a future generation. “If we train our teachers with the help of highly accomplished retired teachers at $20 billion for 20 years, it would be a very important contribution from our governments to create a future generation,” he said.","Infosys founder NR Narayana Murthy has lauded the Narendra Modi government’s National Education Policy (NEP), calling it an ‘excellent idea’ He highlighted the need for a deeper focus on fostering invention and innovation within the Indian mindset.

"In Pictures Israel has continued its attacks on Gaza in advance of an agreed truce with Hamas, killing dozens of Palestinians across the bombarded territory. The relentless raids on Wednesday dimmed hopes that the expected four-day pause would lead to a permanent ceasefire. “The ongoing mass bombardment of the Gaza Strip keeps creating tragedies and misery for Palestinians,” said Al Jazeera’s Hani Mahmoud, reporting from Khan Younis. Three attacks in northern Gaza killed dozens of people, includingentire families. There were also deadly air raids in the southern cities of Khan Younis and Rafah, including a building that houses a charity next to the Kuwait Speciality Hospital in Rafah. Southern Gaza has been designated as a supposedly safe area by the Israeli army, but its continuous bombardment there means that the area is “equally dangerous” to the north and “people are equally at risk of losing their life”, Mahmoud said. In central Gaza, Israeli forces hit residential buildings in Deir el-Balah and the Nuseirat refugee camp, according to Palestinian news agency Wafa, sparking fears of multiple deaths and injuries. Meanwhile, Israeli forces continued raiding towns across the occupied West Bank.

"Chris Caldwell CEO of United Renewables Speaks with Professor Jane Stout Professor of Ecology and Vice President for Biodiversity & Climate Action, at Trinity College Dublin DOUGLAS, Isle of Man, Nov.  13, 2023  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- In an inspiring episode of the ""Conversations on Climate"" podcast sponsored byUnited Renewables, Professor Jane Stout, an expert in ecology, delivered a resounding message: nature is our strongest ally in the critical battle against climate change. Stout, who has devoted her career to the study of ecological systems, eloquently articulated the intrinsic link between human well-being and the natural world - a connection she asserts is crucial for a sustainable future. Aligned with United Renewables' mission,Professor Stout, with the acumen of a seasoned academic and the passion of a true nature enthusiast, drew a compelling parallel between our societal structure and the environment. She envisioned our society as a grand tiered cake, with each tier's stability intrinsically linked to the environmental layer that supports it. This powerful analogy highlighted her vision of sustainability, where the environment is not just a backdrop but the foundation of our civilisation. Through Stout's ecological lens, the world emerges as a complex web of life, with each connection essential to the health of the whole. She championed an ecological mindset that sees humans not as outsiders but as integral elements of nature, with every particle of soil and each leaf in the forest revealing the secrets to our mutual survival. During the conversation, biodiversity was celebrated not just as a concept but as the very heartbeat of our planet, comprising the extensive variety of habitats, species, and genetic differences that beautify our world. Stout's message was unequivocal: biodiversity is not merely a 'nice-to-have' but a crucial shield against the caprices of a changing climate. Professor Stout made a compelling case for the intertwined destinies of business and biodiversity, a narrative that resonates with United Renewables' ethos. She highlighted how every corporate action, from the routine to the monumental, intersects with the natural world. ""Consider the coffee that energises our discussions,"" Stout reflected, ""originating from a plant in a far-off tropic, dependent on the intricate act of pollination - a testament to our deep-seated connection with the offerings of the natural world."" This episode serves as a powerful summons for awareness and action, urging listeners to take up the mantle of environmental stewardship - a principle at the core of United Renewables' philosophy. Stout's clarion call is both enlightening and urgent, compelling us to act swiftly to preserve our planet's vital ecosystems for the enduring benefit of all species. Chris Caldwell, CEO of United Renewables, reflecting on the conversation, acknowledged a common skepticism: ""Aren't we too domesticated, isn't it too late?"" He argued that this very sentiment underscores the urgency with which we must act. It's a call to recognise that despite the advancements and alterations we've made to our environment, it's not too late to make significant changes. Our efforts can still foster a world where nature and human progress coexist in harmony.

"new delhi :the international monetary fund (imf) is looking for a strong budget and narrower deficit from sri lanka as it seeks funding to bridge the gap between government revenue and expenditure, the imf mission chief for the country said on friday. sri lanka plunged into its worst financial crisis in seven decades last year after its foreign exchange reserves dwindled to record lows, but since locking down a $2.9 billion imf programme in march it has managed to partly stabilise its economy, reducing runway inflation and rebuilding reserves. however, the country has struggled to increase public revenue, with the imf projecting a 15 per cent shortfall this year. an improved performance for next year is necessary for sri lanka to get past the first review of its programme with the global lender. sri lanka reached a staff level agreement with the imf late on thursday to release the second tranche of about $330 million but still needs approval from the imf management and executive board. regarding revenues, senior mission chief for sri lanka peter breuer said the objective is not to let a shortfall happen next year, and ensure revenue exceeding 12 per cent of gdp. ""like, approximately 12 months ago, we are of course looking for a strong budget that can achieve that with, of course, the objective being that the gap between expenditure and revenues needs to be narrowed so that sri lanka can, once again, find creditors who are willing to finance the remaining gap,"" breuer told reporters at an online briefing from washington. sri lanka typically uses borrowings from state banks, taxes and government securities to fund its budget. the power regulator approved an 18 per cent electricity tariff hike for households in the country with effect from friday, part of efforts by sri lanka to improve revenue of its state-run power monopoly, the ceylon electricity board. sri lanka increased tariffs by 65 per cent in february before reducing them by 14 per cent in june. the power tariff hike is expected to partly increase the island's inflation from 1.3 per cent in september to about 5 per cent by december, analysts said. meanwhile, china offered to help sri lanka buy more of its exports after leaders of the two countries met in bejing on friday, state media said. this comes a week after the island nation said it had reached agreement with the export-import bank of china on $4.2 billion of debt.","International monetary fund (imf) looking for a strong budget and narrower deficit from sri lanka.

A second clip also showed mice in a box in the Perry Barr branch on Tuesday. The force said: ""Our position is clear, this is appalling, and will not be tolerated.""  Patrols across the region have been increased to reassure communities, police added. Both restaurants were temporarily closed for a full clean and visits from pest control officers, a McDonald's spokesperson said. A video of a reported third incident of a similar nature was also shared on social media on Wednesday, where a group of masked people appeared to empty a box of mice in a branch in Small Heath.

"A group of environmental organizations has submitted a petition to the federal government to ban wolf killing by shooting from helicopters, calling the practice ""barbaric.""The Center for Biological Diversity, Western Watersheds Project and International Wildlife Coexistence Network said they were prompted by Idaho's Wolf Depredation Control Board's October decision to approve the scope of proposed lethal wolf control plans at two Wood River Valley ranches. The proposals, which included plans for aerial gunning, were submitted by Trevor Walch, the owner of a predator control corporation, without the knowledge of the ranches involved.The petition, which cited the Idaho Statesman's reporting on the decision, asks the U.S. Forest Service to prohibit aerial gunning on national forest land. The petition noted that five proposals submitted to the wolf board included control efforts in Idaho Fish and Game management units that overlap five of the seven national forests in Idaho.The Statesman reported that owners of two ranches involved in the Wood River Wolf Project ""were unaware of the proposal"" and had not agreed to partner with the predator control company."" Those ranches have since asked to be withdrawn from the proposals to the board, the petition said.Board co-chairs Jim Fredericks, who heads Fish and Game, and Chanel Tewalt, director of the Idaho State Department of Agriculture, told the Statesman the proposals were part of an effort to include ranchers in wolf management and are still in early stages.The groups asked the Forest Service to ban private contractors from killing wolves via aerial hunting—thoughgovernment agencies, like U.S. Department of Agriculture's Wildlife Services and Idaho Fish and Game, would not be barred from the practice.Petitioners said the proposed aerial gunning over forest lands isn't for the benefit of wildlife or livestock, citing a healthy population of elk in Idaho and ranches' claims that they suffered no livestock depredations from wolves in the last year.""This is essentially illegal sport hunting from aircraft and there is no reason for the government to allow the state's anti-science bloodlust for wolves to be slaked on federally managed lands,"" said Talasi Brooks, a Western Watersheds Project attorney, in the news release.Theenvironmental groupsalso said they believe aerial gunning could be disturbing or dangerous to outdoor recreators and could prove detrimental to endangered species like grizzly bears, wolverines and Canada lynx.The groups said they will considerlegal actionif the Forest Service does not respond to the petition.2023 The Idaho Statesman.

"By Aleksander Palikot November 15, 2023 KYIV -- A stark warning of a ""stalemate,"" a controversial article in a major magazine, and rumblings about elections in a time of war. These are some of the ingredients in what may be the biggest upsurge in political tension in Ukraine since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022. And there's more: A deadly grenade blast far from the front lines and a report alleging high-level Ukrainian involvement in the explosions that virtually destroyed a pipeline for Russian gas supplies to Germany did nothing to dispel the atmosphere of competition and contention in Kyiv. It's not a crisis, nor even a return to the rough-and-tumble of prewar politics in Ukraine. But in a country whose unity in the face of the invasion is perhaps the principal reason Russia has failed to bring it to heel, it could be a glimpse of deeper discord to come, particularly if things go badly on the battlefield as another winter approaches amid uncertainty over the future of Western support. ""If they're up for political scandals in Kyiv while we hold the front here, we're all doomed,"" was how Anatoliy -- a 40-year-old soldier from a brigade stationed near Vulhedar, a southeastern town that has been pummeled by near-constant battles over the past 20 months -- put it. The ""us"" and ""them"" divide is coming up more and more often in Ukraine, where hundreds of thousands of often exhausted soldiers are fighting on the front lines while civilians -- and the political class -- are coming to terms with the fact that the war may be far from over. 'Not A Stalemate'? The prospect of a long, hard road ahead came through loud and clear in an interview in which General Valeriy Zaluzhniy, Ukraine's top military commander, compared the battlefield situation to the ""stalemate"" akin to fighting in World War I and warned that one should expect ""no deep and beautiful breakthrough"" from Ukraine's forces any time soon. In an essay published alongside the interview in The Economist on November 1, Zaluzhniy argued that to ""break the deadlock,"" Ukraine must not only sustain levels of available shells and missiles but also expand its air force, increase domestic defense production, and introduce innovations in drones, electronic warfare, anti-artillery capabilities, and demining equipment. Many soldiers, such as Anatoliy and several of his comrades, took these statements as a straightforward description of their day-to-day reality. Vasyl, who has fought alongside Anatoliy since the successful defense of Kyiv in the first weeks of the full-scale war, told RFE/RL that his unit didn't have ""enough power"" to break through the Russian lines in the summer, after Ukraine launched a long-awaited counteroffensive in June, and is now focusing on digging trenches deep enough to protect them from the constant Russian shelling and bomb attacks. ""Zaluzhniy was right on the mark -- well done!"" Vasyl said. ""But this alone does not solve our problems."" In Kyiv, Zaluzhniy's words didn't go over so well: They were widely perceived as a tacit acknowledgment that the counteroffensive has failed to achieve its goals. And they provoked an unusual exchange between military and political leaders, not least between Zaluzhniy and President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, that got tongues wagging both in and outside Ukraine about whether a rift long believed to be bubbling beneath the surface was emerging into the open -- and how wide it might get. Two days after the publication, Zelenskiy's deputy chief of staff, Ihor Zhovkva, speaking live on national television, said the military should refrain from such public statements, warning that talk of a deadlock ""makes the work of the aggressor easier."" He said he had swiftly received a ""panicked"" phone call from a senior official in a country that supports Ukraine's defense against Russia. One the same day, Zelenskiy dismissed one of Zaluzhniy's deputies, Brigadier General Viktor Khorenko, from his role as commander of the Special Operations Forces and appointed a replacement, saying new results are expected. Khorenko later said he and Zaluzhniy were blindsided by the dismissal. At a news conference the next day, Zelenskiy publicly took issue with Zaluzhniy's choice of words. ""Time has passed, people are tired regardless of their status, and this is understandable,"" he said, but the battlefield situation ""is not a stalemate."" Backers of Russia were quick to exploit the situation. On November 7, a fake video disseminated on social media purported to show Zaluzhniy saying Zelenskiy is a ""traitor"" and calling for a military coup. Media And Message The spat poured more fuel on a controversy already swirling over a front-page article in the October 30 edition of Time magazine. The article cited several people close to Zelenskiy who spoke on condition of anonymity, including one who said the president ""deludes himself"" about the war and added, ""We're out of options. We're not winning. But try telling him that."" It cited another as saying Zelenskiy felt betrayed by the West. Amid concerns about the counteroffensive and questions about the future of Western support, the Time article touched off nerves in Kyiv. Mykhaylo Podolyak, a senior adviser to Zelenskiy, told RFE/RL's Ukrainian Service that it reflected the ""subjective point of view of a specific journalist."" Oleksiy Danilov, secretary of the National Security and Defense Council, claimed it misrepresented the mood in the president's office and said some of its content resembled Russian propaganda. In separate comments, Podolyak denied that Zaluzhniy's remarks in The Economist reflected a rift between Ukraine's military and political leadership. Nevertheless, the two publications contributed to what turned out to be the most politically frantic week since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion. 'Tempted' By Elections The main catalyst, though, was a remark by Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba, who said on November 3 that Zelenskiy is considering holding a presidential election next spring. ""We are not closing this page,"" Kuleba said, adding Zelenskiy was ""weighing the various pros and cons"" and that holding elections in wartime would entail ""unprecedented"" challenges. Parliamentary elections were supposed to be held in October, followed by a presidential vote in March 2024 -- the same month in which Russian President Vladimir Putin is expected to secure a new six-year term in his country. But Ukraine's constitution does not require holding elections during martial law, and by some interpretations it prohibits them. While it had been widely assumed that no presidential election would be held next March or at any time before conditions allow for safe, free, and fair voting, Kuleba's statement was far from the first time the possibility had been raised in Ukraine -- or in the West, for that matter. In May, the president of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, Tiny Kox, said Ukraine should organize elections despite the war because the Council of Europe's charter obliges it to do so. In August, during a visit to Kyiv, Republican U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham -- a vocal supporter of Ukraine and critic of Putin -- also said that elections should take place next year. At the same time, critics of Ukraine in the West, such as former Fox News host Tucker Carlson, have questioned whether Ukraine is a democracy -- echoing a Russian narrative -- and said Kyiv should hold elections if it wants to prove otherwise. Until a seemingly unequivocal comment he made three days after Kuleba's remark had stirred up debate, Zelenskiy himself had not been entirely clear about where he stood on the issue. On August 27, he seemed skeptical about the possibility of holding elections during the war, saying on national television that it would require legislative changes, funding from foreign partners, and international observers even on the front lines. On October 10, he stated he would run for president if the elections were held before the war ended -- despite his 2019 promise not to seek a second term -- and later declared he would be ready to hold a vote if the parliament and government find answers to all the involved challenges. Political analyst Ihor Reiterovych told RFE/RL that Zelenskiy is ""tempted"" to try to hold a presidential election because as a wartime leader with a high trust level he would have a good chance of winning a second term. That would give him more room to maneuver as the war continues and potentially protect him from declining support if things go badly on the battlefield, he said. Zelenskiy's approval rating remains high but has decreased, falling to 76 percent in October from 91 percent in May, according to the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology (KIIS). Reiterovych believes that's why several formal and informal working groups in parliament and the government have been discussing the possibility of holding elections under military conditions. 'Now Is Not The Time' Many NGOs have strongly urged against holding elections in the near future unless the situation changes dramatically. On September 18 over 100 civil society organizations published a joint statement urging the authorities not to hold elections, arguing that democratic voting is incompatible with a full-scale war. According to Olha Aivazovska, board chairwoman at Opora, a Kyiv-based civil rights group that monitors elections, frequent Russian missile, drone, and artillery attacks make it impossible to ensure the safety of voters. ""If there are massive rocket attacks across the country on election day and the turnout is 5 or 10 percent, how legitimate would that be as an expression of the people's will?"" she asked rhetorically. Moreover, with more than 6 million refugees abroad, almost 5 million internally displaced people, millions living under Russian occupation, and about 1 million serving in the army and security forces, opponents of a wartime election say citizens would not have equal voting rights. Critics also say a big barrier to ensuring an even field is the fact that Ukraine's main TV channels are broadcasting the same shared content all day within the so-called United News Telemarathon, which could limit opposition access to the airwaves. Crucially, potential voters themselves are overwhelmingly against holding elections at this point. A survey by KIIS indicated that 81 percent of citizens believe elections should be held after the war, while only 16 percent support holding them despite the war. This is why Zelenskiy eventually backed down on the idea of holding an election next March after ""testing it with the public,"" according to Oleksiy Koshel, director of the Committee of Voters of Ukraine, an election monitoring organization. On November 6, after debate about a potential vote swept through the media, Zelenskiy said that ""now is not the time for elections."" ""We must decide that now is the time of defense, the time of the battle, on which the fate of the state and people depend,"" he said in his nightly address. But some believe the comments marked a pause, an effort to put politics on hold, rather than final word on the contentious subject of elections. ""All signs of the unofficial start of an election campaign are evident,"" Koshel told RFE/RL. He pointed to pervasive political advertising and ""anti-advertising"" -- also known as mudslinging -- on the Internet. He argued that holding elections in 2024 remains the most likely scenario for Ukraine's leadership, especially in the event of a deterioration of the military situation or even the prospect of having to agree to an unfavorable peace agreement. ""Either we saw a false start or all the important players have begun preparations,"" Koshel said.

"ANI Union Minister of State for Home Nityanand Rai  Patna: In a scathing riposte to  Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar  over his distasteful remarks on women during a debate on caste census at the state  Assembly ,  Union Minister Nityanand Rai  said he has lost his ""mental balance"". Speaking to on Wednesday, the Union Minister said, ""His remarks were highly objectionable. Only a person, who has lost his mental bearings, can use such crass words against women. He is no longer worthy of holding the CM's office. he has lowered the country's image by sullying its culture. He should extend an unqualified apology and retire from politics."" BJP spokesperson  Shehzad Poonawalla  on Wednesday also came down on the  Bihar  CM over his statement saying that it was ""despicable, disgusting, atrocious, obnoxious and women virodhi"". Speaking on the floor of the Assembly, the Bihar CM said women should be educated as it would enable them to avoid sexual intercourse from resulting in pregnancy. #Elections With  Assembly Election News All Madhya Pradesh Rajasthan Telangana Chhattisgarh Mizoram Telangana Minister KTR Rao falls down from vehicle during election rally in Nizamabad Telangana polls: CM KCR files nomination from Gajwel, Kamareddy Mizoram elections: Police personnel on poll duty goes missing in Saitual district Congress govt set up PSUs that gave jobs to youth but BJP handing them over to industrialists: Priyanka Gandhi The remark drew outrage from the BJP as well as the  National Commission for Women  (NCW), who demanded that he tender an unconditional apology. ""The comments made by  Nitish Kumar  were despicable, disgusting, atrocious, obnoxious, and women 'virodhi'. It only shows the impact their (JDU's) ally RJD has had on his and the government's thinking. If they think like this and make such distasteful remarks in the Assembly then one can well imagine the plight of women in Bihar.  Tejaswhi Yadav  (deputy CM) justified his statement calling it sex education. This only goes to show the depths to which this alliance has stooped,"" Poonawalla said in a self-made video on Wednesday.  The chief minister made the remarks while underlining the need for girls' education to check population growth. In a video, the Bihar CM was heard saying that the state's fertility rate, which was earlier at 4.3 per cent, has dropped to 2.9 per cent, as per a report last year. The National Commission for Women chairperson, Rekha Sharma, sought an immediate apology from the Bihar CM over his remarks, saying, ""I demand an immediate and unequivocal apology from the Chief Minister of Bihar, Nitish Kumar. His crass remarks in the Vidhan Sabha are an affront to the dignity and respect that every woman deserves. Such derogatory and cheap language used during his speech is a dark stain on our society. If a leader can make such comments so openly in a democracy, one can only imagine the horror the state must be enduring under his leadership."" His bizarre remarks on population control in the state also drew flak from women legislators. BJP MLA Nikki Hembrom labelled the CM's remarks as insensitive, saying, ""Whatever he said could have been presented in a more dignified manner. His remarks were insensitive and show that he has no respect for women,"" Nikki said. Defending Nitish Kumar, Deputy CM Tejashwi Yadav said it was wrong to misinterpret the chief minister's remarks as he was only talking about sex education. ""It is wrong if someone misinterprets it. The CM's remarks pertained to sex education. People are often hesitant when it comes to sex education. It is now being taught in schools just as other subjects are. Children are learning about it. He only said what should be done to control population. His words should be taken in their proper sense,"" Yadav said.  Experience Your Economic Times Newspaper, The Digital Way!

"To stand out from other candidates, job seekers are increasingly called on to earn certifications, learn new skills and develop their personal brands. However, these rapidly shifting expectations have led to common misconceptions among job seekers about what it takes to get hired. Here, 11 Young Entrepreneur Council members share their perspectives on these common misbeliefs and the advice they would give to job seekers instead. Consider their insights to gain clarity on how prospective job candidates can develop the right strategies to land the jobs of their dreams. 1. ‘Qualifications Alone Will Land Me The Job’ One major misconception is thinking that qualifications alone will land a dream job. In reality, passion is a distinguishing factor. Employers have a keen ability to spot genuine enthusiasm versus feigned interest. True passion is reflected in the details like how you talk about your work, the extra effort you put in without being asked and the excitement you bring to challenges. Without passion, even the most qualified employee can burn out or lack innovation. My advice is to dive deep into what truly ignites your fire. When you’re genuinely passionate, it's palpable, and employers will see and value that authenticity. - Brandon Ginsberg, ApparelMagic 2. ‘I Need To Show That I Can Do Anything’ Job seekers should have some focus. Some job seekers will say, “I can do anything.” When I look for a new hire though, whether at an entry or a senior level, I am hiring for a specific role with specific criteria that are known to all candidates. Anyone too broad in their job search usually shows that they haven’t taken the time to really think through the key focus areas of the role I am hiring for. While they think they are demonstrating openness to new opportunities, they usually leave an impression that they don’t take the role seriously, or not seriously enough to relate experience or interest to what I need. It doesn’t mean you can’t evolve your focus or shift, but show that you’ve done your homework by focusing on what you want and what you need. - JT Allen, myFootpath LLC 3. ‘I Need To Be Lucky Enough To Know The Right People’ Many job seekers believe that landing their dream job requires luck or knowing the right people. However, that is far from the truth. The reality is that getting a job—especially your dream job—takes a combination of hard work, preparation and perseverance. Instead of relying on luck or connections, focus on building a strong foundation for your career journey. Know what you want to do, tailor your cover letter and resume to every job in which you apply and be smart and strategic with your networking efforts. - Kristin Kimberly Marquet, Marquet Media, LLC 4. ‘Finding My Dream Job Will Be Easy And Straightforward’ Many job seekers have the mistaken belief that finding a job is a quick and straightforward process. Many folks assume that sending out a few resumes and attending a couple of interviews will lead to immediate employment. But job searching can be a much more extended journey than expected. It's crucial for job seekers to understand that finding the right job can take time, and the process can be full of ups and downs. Be patient and persistent. Understand that job hunting isn't a linear path; it's more like a marathon than a sprint. Don't get discouraged by rejections or setbacks along the way. Keep refining your approach, networking and learning from each experience. Success may not come overnight, but with determination and a positive mindset, you can increase your chances of landing your dream job. - Pratik Chaskar, Spectra 5. ‘I Need To Embellish My Resume To Seem Impressive’ One misconception that job seekers have about what it takes to get a job is that it's okay to oversell experiences or qualifications in your resume. This generally happens when job seekers fall short of the requirements to be a potential candidate. Many of them resort to fabricating information and adding a few extra achievements to their name. This is a huge misconception that can lead them to lose an opportunity and cause them to be blocked by the firm and its acquaintances. The best course of action here is to improve yourself once you've identified your shortcomings. You should aim to acquire the skills you currently lack, as it may make you an ideal candidate for similar job openings you come across in the future. - Stephanie Wells, Formidable Forms 6. ‘I’ll Need To Lower My Salary Expectations’ You might think that lowering your salary expectations will make you more appealing. This is wrong! Be confident in your skills and do some market research to make sure your target salary is in range of the job parameters. Lowering your salary expectations can make you look less experienced or less competitive than other applicants. Have a base salary line that you just won't go under in case you get stressed in an interview. - Shu Saito, SpiroPure 7. ‘The Best Strategy Is To Apply To As Many Jobs As Possible’ I think many job seekers, especially early in their careers, see getting a job as a kind of numbers game. They cast a wide net, apply to many companies and just hope that someone will hire them. I know that I've met someone in this category if I interview them and they barely know anything about my company. This approach doesn't make the best impression. Aside from that, it shows a lack of focus. Even if you're applying for your first job, it's best to have a strategy. Consider what company is the best match for your skills and personality and which will help you reach your goals. Map out your goals and choose the companies that are a good match. This includes companies that aren't advertising or posting on job boards. - Kalin Kassabov, ProTexting 8. ‘My Resume Will Be Enough To Get Me Through The Hiring Process’ One common misconception among jobseekers is the belief that having an impressive resume and qualifications will guarantee them their dream job. While these are important, what often matters just as much is the ability to effectively communicate one's skills, experiences and passion during interviews. It's about showcasing your personality and demonstrating how you can add value to the company culture. My advice to jobseekers is to not underestimate the importance of soft skills, networking and a compelling narrative in interviews. - Jared Weitz, United Capital Source Inc. 9. ‘I Need To Seem Perfect In Order To Get Hired’ The biggest misconception is that there is a perfect candidate. This is not true. Employers are looking for someone with the technical ability to do the job but also someone genuine and real. Far too often, people enter the interview process trying to be who they think people want. In reality, being honest and showing their true personality are way more important for job seekers. People want to connect with people, and if you are putting on a show, it is unlikely to resonate with others. - Zane Stevens, Protea Financial 10. ‘My Technical Skills Will Be The Most Important To Highlight’ Job seekers often mistakenly think that only technical skills and qualifications matter in the job hunt. Many individuals tend to overlook the importance of soft skills like communication, teamwork, adaptability and problem-solving. However, this misconception couldn't be further from the truth. Soft skills play a pivotal role in the workplace because they determine how well you can collaborate with colleagues, handle challenges and contribute to a positive work environment. My advice is clear: Don't underestimate the value of your soft skills. During interviews, don't just focus on showcasing your technical expertise; highlight your ability to work well with others, communicate effectively and adapt to changing circumstances. These skills often make the difference between a good employee and an exceptional one. - Sujay Pawar, CartFlows 11. ‘The Best Jobs Are At Big-Name Companies’ Many think that working for a well-known corporation is the ultimate goal and that smaller companies don't offer as good of opportunities, but this notion can be quite limiting. While big companies have their advantages, smaller ones can provide unique and valuable experiences that are often overlooked. My advice is to not underestimate the potential of smaller players. They can offer a more dynamic and hands-on work environment where you can take on diverse responsibilities and make a real impact. You might have the chance to work closely with leadership, learn various aspects of the business and contribute significantly to the company's growth. - Abhijeet Kaldate, Astra WordPress Theme","11 Young Entrepreneur Council members share their perspectives on these common misbeliefs.

"london :     some of the world's poorest countries face budget cuts topping $220 billion over the coming five years due to a debt crisis that has pushed dozens to the brink of default, according to an oxfam international report released on monday. oxfam's report, released at the start of the imf-world bank meetings in marrakech and drawing on imf outlooks, also found that on current terms, low- and lower-middle income countries face nearly half a billion dollars a day in interest and debt repayments through 2029. a record number of developing nations are in debt distress as rising global interest rates, soaring inflation and a series of economic shocks following the covid-19 pandemic hammer state finances. ratings agency fitch said that as of march, there have been 14 separate default events since 2020 across nine different sovereigns. oxfam called on the imf and the world bank to use the crisis to create a fairer system - rather than focusing on debt restructure and spending cuts. ""their answer to the debt crisis is more austerity, and their answer to the financing gulf is more loans,"" oxfam international interim executive director amitabh behar said in a statement. ""true win-wins, like fairly taxing the rich, are being left on the table."" the imf did immediately respond to a request for comment. oxfam and other aid and campaign groups have previously called on international creditors to cancel the debts of developing countries facing economic crisis. the report also said that debt servicing payments for the poorest countries is outstripping healthcare spending by four to one. debt reworks for some of the defaulted nations, including zambia and ghana, are expected to make progress during in-person meetings in marrakech, while the imf will continue conversations with tunisia, pakistan, egypt and other over the terms of proposed bailout loans.","Low- and lower-middle income countries face nearly half a billion dollars a day in interest and debt repayments through 2029.

Combat around Avdiivka, Kupyansk and Marinka is the most intense. “Russian forces will likely struggle to fully regain the initiative across the theater,” says the study. “The Russian military command will likely have to decide whether to keep certain Russian elements on certain sectors of the front to defend against ongoing Ukrainian offensive operations or to redeploy them to support offensive operations elsewhere that will likely culminate without reinforcements.” Meanwhile, the Ukrainian army has gained a foothold on the left bank of the Dnipro River.

"GURGAON: A typical demand among many individuals and RWAs in Gurgaon who want strays removed from their housing society on one pretext or another is that ""dogs should not be fed"", often trying to socially isolate residents who ignore their illegal diktat.But feeding street dogs is not a crime -- it's a right guaranteed by the Constitution.

"One of the most respected figures in Tunisian cinema discusses her journey with Al Jazeera. When she speaks in English, Dora Bouchoucha’s lilting voice still holds traces of her time in the United Kingdom. Leaning towards her camera, she says: “I need to be touched. I like films that reveal the hidden part of a character.” The Tunisian film producer is one of the most innovative and respected figures in Tunisian cinema and has mentored many young directors to find their path and message. “I like plots that delve into how humans are perceived. We live in a culture where, as long as things are hidden behind a door, everything is fine.” Her approach and keen eye for talent have resulted in the stellar success of Tunisian directors like Raja Amari and Mohamed Ben Attia, who have seen their films selected for international festivals around the world. Bouchoucha spoke to Al Jazeera via video conference after one of her workshops for Ateliers Sud Écriture, which fosters emerging Arab and African filmmakers. Relaxed and expressive, she was happy to talk. For her, film production came relatively late, long after her first love, literature, and it was a chance conversation with Tunisian director Moufida Tlatli in the mid-1990s that led to her first experience on a film set. “Moufida shared with me the script of Les silences du palais [The Silences of the Palace, 1994]. After we discussed it, Moufida asked me to join the crew on set,” Bouchoucha explains. Les silences du palais was the first feature film by a female director from the Arab world to find international success. On set, Bouchoucha worked with one of Tunisia’s most celebrated producers, Ahmed Baha Eddine Attia, who introduced her to much of the profession. During the course of the conversation, she described the way she has used her career to engage and inspire new generations of filmmakers. Bouchoucha was born in 1957 in Manouba, near Tunis. Her father was the director of a hospital, and her mother ran an orphanage. After a challenging education at the predominantly male Collège Sadiki in Tunis, she moved to the UK. “After my secondary schooling, I went to England to study English,” she says to me. But “I’ve always wanted to come back to my homeland. So I finished my higher education in English literature at the University of Tunis.” Unearthing talents Following the success of The Silences of the Palace, Bouchoucha co-founded Nomadis Images, with the director Ibrahim Letaïef in 1995. Through this production company, located to the north of Tunisia’s capital in La Marsa, she has realised numerous local and international feature-length, short and documentary films, as well as having helped unearth countless talented filmmakers. Discounting the trends and fads of much of modern cinema, Bouchoucha draws inspiration from current issues, such as memory, political violence and self-liberation. Her first productions with Nomadis Images were Raja Amari’s short films, April (1998) and One Evening in July (2000). Afterwards, she continued to produce and co-produce Amari’s work, including the acclaimed Red Satin (2002), which tells the story of a widowed Tunisian housewife who takes up belly dancing as a form of liberation for the female body. However, despite being a relatively lone female voice, Bouchoucha rejects the idea that she may have been the victim of discrimination. “Looking back, I didn’t have the impression that I had to fight battles. I mingled a lot. I wouldn’t say that it was difficult to be a producer because I was a woman,” she recalls. What discrimination she did encounter, such as being labelled, along with Amari, the “scandalous women of Tunisia” when Red Satin was released is remembered with wry amusement rather than resentment. In addition to her own work, Bouchoucha has also worked alongside Tunisian director Mohamed Ben Attia’s transition from short fiction films to feature film, co-producing Hedi, a Wind of Freedom (2016) with the Dardenne brothers’ production company, Les Films du Fleuve. Hedi, a Wind of Freedom, went on to win the Best First Feature Award and the Silver Bear for Best Actor at the 66th Berlin International Film Festival. Along with Amari, Bouchoucha has continued to work with Ben Attia, producing his subsequent films, Dear Son (2018) and the recently added Behind the Mountains (2023), the story of a man breaking free from his banal environment and dismissing society’s banal principles, codes and institutions.      Festivals, juries and collaborations In 1997, Bouchoucha founded Sud Écriture, a small association which mentors emerging African and Arab filmmakers, together with her Nomadis Images colleague Lina Chaabane and the now-retired Annie Djamal. As the industry grows and gains more international appreciation, record numbers of African films have had their premieres in international film festivals, such as this year in Cannes. “In 26 years of activity, the Sud Écriture workshops have trained more than 200 emerging filmmakers from the African Continent and the Arab World,” Bouchoucha says. Asmae El Moudir, director of The Mother of All Lies (2023), which is Morocco’s entry for the Best International Film at the 96th Academy Awards, attended the workshop series. The hybrid documentary directed, written and co-produced by Asmae El Moudir is inspired by bread riots in El Moudir’s home city of Casablanca in 1981, and world premiered at Cannes this year. Since 2011, Sud Écriture has also regularly organised a workshop for six national projects, with the support of the French Institute of Tunisia and the Tunisian Ministry of Culture. “Aside from our Sud Ecriture workshops, I contribute to the Doha Producers Lab, to Ouaga Film Lab, In Burkina Faso and Up Courts in Senegal. This is important for me as I witness the cinema of the continent and the MENA region,” she said, “I noticed how the narrative has evolved, how the stories are strong and diverse. When we look up at the last Cannes lineup, we are happy to say that most of them had been developed in these labs.” Plaudits for Bouchoucha’s contribution to film have come from as far afield as El Gouna and Luxor film festivals in Egypt and MedFilm in Rome. Ginella Vocca, founder and artistic director of the MedFilm Festival in Rome had no hesitation in rendering her verdict on Bouchoucha’s contribution to cinema. “For years, Dora Bouchoucha has tirelessly supported and launched outstanding filmmakers,” she said by phone. Calling the Tunisian producer “a colleague but also a friend”, Vocca continued, describing how Bouchoucha was distinguished by “the absolute dedication she reserves to the projects she works on”. In addition to producing films, Bouchoucha led the Carthage Film Festival as general director in 2008, 2010 and 2014. She has also served as a jury member at the 67th Berlin International Film Festival in 2017 and for the Luigi De Laurentiis Award for a Debut Film at the 77th Venice International Film Festival in 2020. In 2018, Bouchoucha was elected to join the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which runs the annual Oscars Awards, along with 11 other Arab filmmakers. However, suggestions that the space for free speech is shrinking within Tunisia are dismissed: “Nowadays free speech is threatened in the entire world,” she said, pointing to the relative silencing of prominent Muslim voices in the US. “So I can say that free speech in Tunisia is not doing [too] badly.”          Follow Al Jazeera English:","Dora Bouchoucha is one of the most respected figures in Tunisian cinema.

"A former US state department official has been sentenced to nearly six years in prison for his role in the US Capitol riot.  Federico Klein, 45, was convicted in July on 12 charges, including assaulting officers and obstructing an official proceeding.

The former Marine spent more than an hour pushing against the line of officers and encouraged others to attack police, according to evidence at trial. At the time, Klein was working as a South America specialist at the state department, a post he was appointed to by the Trump administration in 2017.

Prosecutors had asked for a sentence of 10 years. But in a pre-sentencing memo, Klein's lawyers argued that the government was exaggerating his role in the riot. They said he ""should be sentenced for his actual role in the events of the day, and not the more egregious conduct of others"".

"""If you hear an alarm sounding it means you need to run to the nearest bunker,"" says Captain Aódhan McGuinness as we arrive at Camp Shamrock.  He is the tactical operations director for the Irish troops who run this UN peacekeeping base close to the Lebanon-Israel border.  We can hear the buzz of Israeli drones hovering overhead. They sound like hair dryers or electric razors, and are now a constant presence day and night above towns and villages in southern Lebanon.  A loud explosion nearby interrupts Captain McGuinness' safety briefing.  ""Ok, today's round has started,"" he says.  The blast is yet another sign of escalating tensions in the area since Hamas launched its unprecedented assault on Israel back in October. The UN peacekeeping mission, known as Unifil, is responsible for monitoring the Blue Line, the unofficial frontier between Lebanon and Israel. During the last four decades the area has witnessed on and off clashes between the Lebanese Shia Muslim militant group, Hezbollah, and the Israeli army.  While Hezbollah is labelled a terrorist organisation by the UK, US and others, it is a mainstream political party in Lebanon, leading an alliance which fell just short of a majority in the national parliament in elections last year. Wearing body armour and helmets we join a group of heavily armed peacekeepers in a convoy of armoured vehicles for a 20-minute drive to another base that is just 500m (1,600ft) from the Blue Line.  With Israeli military installations visible across the frontier, the commander of the outpost, Lieutenant Dylan Cadogan, says they often have to take shelter in bunkers during strikes, sometimes for hours.  ""We have seen houses destroyed and we have seen civilians caught in crossfire that needed our help."" From the base's watchtower he points at a pink house in the distance: ""There was a mother and a child in that building only 400m (1,300ft) from us.  ""Their house was shelled, and they had to run here to take refuge and we provided them with medical support and took them to safety.""  The Unifil troops have recovered the bodies of people killed in the fighting but cannot say how many were Hezbollah fighters due to the sensitivity of their mission and the need to remain neutral between the warring parties.  ""It is not our job to comment on these, just observe, monitor and report what we see to our headquarters,"" Lieutenant Cadogan says.  Since Israel launched its offensive on Gaza following Hamas's attack on 7 October, Hezbollah has regularly carried out rocket and drone attacks from southern Lebanon, some aimed at military targets, others fired more indiscriminately into northern Israel.  Israeli forces have retaliated with heavy air strikes and artillery fire.  Due to the fighting 60,000 people have been displaced from the border area on the Lebanese side, while thousands of Israelis have been evacuated from northern Israel.  Monitoring groups say that in the first week following Hamas's attack in October there were around 70 reported incidents near the Blue Line, and by mid-November it had risen to about 250 attacks a week.  The peacekeeping force was first deployed in 1978 after Israel invaded southern Lebanon in response to cross border attacks from there by the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO).  Since then, more than 300 peacekeepers have been killed, 48 of them Irish, something which is on the minds of the troops' families.  Captain Tony Smith, 27, on his second deployment, regularly reassures his relatives back home in Wexford, in south east Ireland.  ""Of course my mother wants me to go home now, which eventually I will, but she knows why we are here and despite her concerns she supports that."" Approaching the nearby town of Tebnine, posters of Hezbollah leader Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah and fallen Hezbollah fighters line the road.  It's 10km (6.2 miles) from the Blue Line and has been heavily damaged in previous conflicts.  Like most of the towns and villages in southern Lebanon, Hezbollah is very influential here and controls security in the area.  One of the local residents, 57-year-old Ali Saad, says he grew up with the Irish Unifil soldiers. Speaking with a distinctive Irish accent, Ali says one peacekeeper helped teach him English when he was a young boy.  That soldier was one of three generations of the same Irish family to serve with Unifil. His father also served several decades ago, and his son is currently stationed in Lebanon. Ali credits the Irish troops with helping to save his life when they picked him up from school and took him to one of their bunkers during an air strike.  In the years since, he has worked as a translator for Unifil and a group of Irish soldiers even attended his wedding to his wife, Bassima, who also helps the peacekeepers with language services.  But while Ali values the troops' presence, he is sad that the conflict they are there to monitor has dragged on so long.  ""To be honest we never thought this mission would last for over 44 years,"" he says.  For Bassima the current fighting has brought back painful memories of earlier conflicts, like the Israel-Hezbollah war in 2006.  ""I was putting my younger son inside an empty washing machine because I was hoping that it could project him,"" she says.  ""Now, we keep hearing all these sounds of explosions and I just can't take it."" She believes that growing up surrounded by conflict has affected her son, who is now 23. He still gets nervous when Unifil helicopters fly overhead.   ""We can't go back to where we were,"" she adds. ""We are wasting our life from one conflict to another, I just cannot go through another war."" Back at the base, Unifil commander Lieutenant Colonel Cathal Keohane is concerned that the level of violence in the area has been increasing. ""We have seen an expansion and more attacks deeper inside to Lebanon, we have seen a wider range of weapons being used,"" he says, worrying that the situation could escalate.  ""Whether it arises deliberately from one side, or some inadvertent circumstances precipitate the outbreak of all-out war, that is a serious concern for us."" He hopes that the ceasefire in Gaza will lead to an easing of tensions around the Blue Line, but says it could take displaced people some time to return to their homes, even if the cross border fire ends.","Camp Shamrock is a UN peacekeeping base close to the Lebanon-Israel border.

"WASHINGTON, DC - U.S. Senate Majority Leader Charles Schumer (D-NY) is calling on the FTC to launch ... [+] an antitrust investigation into recent mergers in the oil sector. (Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images) As the adage goes, to a hammer, everything looks like a nail. When it comes to Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and other anti-energy forces in Washington, it seems any moves by energy producers, even perfectly sensible ones, are yet another sign of misbehavior crying out for government action. In Schumer's latest reckoning, significant mergers in the oil industry were the reason for penning a letter to the Federal Trade Commission, along with 22 Senate colleagues, asking regulators to launch antitrust probes.

Schumer and 22 Senate colleagues have written a letter to the Federal Trade Commission. This letter requests the FTC to investigate the recent mergers in the oil sector, such as the proposed merger between Chevron and Exxon Mobil and the merger between Chevron and ConocoPhillips. The letter mentions the “growing market power of these oil and gas companies.” The letter also notes that the FTC has already opened an investigation into the proposed merger between Exxon Mobil and Chevron. This letter asks the FTC to look into other mergers in the oil sector as well. Schumer has previously called on the FTC to investigate the oil industry’s price increases, which have led to an increase in gas prices at the pump. In a recent statement, Schumer said that the oil industry’s price increases are a “direct consequence” of these mergers. Schumer has also called on the FTC to investigate the oil industry’s production levels, which have been declining.

"LOUISVILLE, Ky. --The man who fatally shot five coworkers at a Louisville bank in April wrote in his journal that he wasn’t sure if his mental health struggles would preclude him from purchasing a gun and then later, after acquiring one just days before carrying out the mass shooting, remarked on how easy the transaction turned out to be. The journal writings by Connor Sturgeon were contained in a 64-page report released Tuesday by Louisville police, where authorities say they have now closed the investigation into the actions of the 25-year-old who also died that day in an exchange of gunfire with authorities. Sturgeon wrote that it “was so easy” to purchase the assault rifle, a Radical Firearms RF-15, from a Louisville gun store, according to the police file. He bought the rifle, 120 rounds and four magazine cartridges for $700 six days before the shooting, and the process took about 45 minutes, he said. “Seriously, I knew it would be doable but this is ridiculous,” he wrote. He also acknowledged his struggles with mental illness and said he was dissatisfied with his job and the direction his life was taking. He wrote that he was “very sick” and suggested that he had lied about his health to avoid further treatment or institutionalization. The April 10 shootings began when Sturgeon opened fire in a conference room in the downtown high-rise bank building. One of the first officers to respond was struck in the head and critically wounded. Another officer shot and killed the gunman in the lobby. Sturgeon fired more than 40 rounds over the course of about eight minutes, according to the report. Investigators remarked that it appeared he “did not have a firm understanding” of how to operate the weapon. The report noted that investigators did not find “evidence of long-term planning,” though there were references in his journals to what he intended to do in the days beforehand. Nor did investigators find evidence he made extensive online searches related to gun violence. Sturgeon’s family has said they intend to sue the maker of the rifle used in the attack. His parents said his mental health struggle began a year earlier with panic attacks, anxiety and a suicide attempt, but he was seeing a psychiatrist and taking medication. His mother, Lisa Sturgeon, said his roommate called her the morning of the shooting to say Sturgeon told him by phone: “I’m going to go in and shoot up Old National.” She called 911, but her son was already at the bank. The five employees killed were Joshua Barrick, 40, a senior vice president; Deana Eckert, 57, an executive administrative officer; Tommy Elliott, 63, also a senior vice president; Juliana Farmer, 45, a loan analyst; and Jim Tutt Jr., 64, a commercial real estate market executive. Elliott was a close personal friend of Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear. Eight others were injured including Nickolas Wilt, the officer who was shot in the head and who was released from the hospital in late July after months of rehab. Sturgeon was shot by an officer in the right arm twice, the left leg once and once in the head, according to the report. Investigators determined that the actions of the officer who shot Sturgeon were not criminal, the report said.","The journal writings by Connor Sturgeon were contained in a 64-page report.

"a jury in california ruled that a clothing company should pay more than $1 million to four american airlines flight attendants who blamed chemicals used in the production of their uniforms for causing a variety of ailments including rashes, headaches and breathing problems. the verdict last week could be just the tip of the iceberg: lawyers say they represent more than 400 other flight attendants who are making the same claims against the uniform maker. the judge has not affirmed the jury's decision. a lawyer for the flight attendants called that step a technicality. the uniform maker's lawyers declined to say whether they will appeal. american gave new uniforms to flight attendants in 2016, and many were happy to get them after a decade wearing the same outfit. complaints soon followed, however. “i would wake up and my eyes would be completely swollen. i looked like i had been in a boxing match,” says tracey silver-charan. “i was unable to breathe. i often felt like i was going to pass out on the job. i was coming home and my husband was running me to the urgent care.” american gave flight attendants the option of wearing their old uniforms, or even picking out an outfit at macy's or jcpenney, said silver-charan, a los angeles-based flight attendant who has been in the field for 37 years. silver-charan is part of a group of flight attendants who sued in 2017, and she was among four involved in the bellwether trial in alameda county superior court near san francisco to see how a jury would view the case. the jury decided that the uniforms provided by twin hill acquisition co. were a “substantial factor in causing harm” to the flight attendants. however, jurors said the company was not negligent in its design of the garments nor in failing to recall them when complaints began to pour in. “it's been a long road, but we're very happy with the outcome,” said daniel balaban, one of the lawyers for the airline employees. “we couldn't represent better clients — who doesn't love a flight attendant?” balaban said that other cases could go to trial if twin hill declines to settle them. twin hill could ask the judge to reduce the jury award and could appeal the verdict. a lawyer for the company, robert v. good jr., declined to comment when reached by phone. american eventually ended the contract with twin hill and contracted with land’s end for uniforms. in their lawsuit, the flight attendants claimed that their uniforms contained traces of formaldehyde, toluene and other toxic chemicals linked to health problems. resins containing formaldehyde have been used in fabric for years to keep clothes wrinkle-free and make them last longer. a 2010 study by congressional researchers found that formaldehyde levels in clothing is generally low, but some people suffer allergic reactions including rashes, blisters, and itchy or burning skin. washing clothes before wearing them can help, but doesn't always work, the researcher said. the flight attendants' lawyers put on witnesses who testified about a 2018 study by researchers at the harvard school of public health, who reported finding a link between new uniforms and health complaints by alaska airlines attendants. lawyers for twin hill put on expert witnesses who discounted the potential health effects of the uniforms. silver-charan said none of the defense experts ever talked to her or asked to test her uniform for chemicals. the jury proposed $320,000 in lost income and pain and suffering for silver-charan and $750,000 in damages for brenda sabbatino — the two attendants chosen by their lawyers. defense lawyers selected two others who had reported less severe health effects. for them, the jurors proposed $10,000 and $5,000 in damages.","Four flight attendants claimed chemicals used in the production of their uniforms caused rashes, headaches and breathing problems.

"The well-travelled English coach talks to Al Jazeera about taking on one of the toughest jobs in international football. Islamabad, Pakistan –On the morning of October 17,Stephen Constantine, the head coach of the Pakistan men’s football team, discovered that the squad had bought him a cake for his 61st birthday. Constantine, a strict disciplinarian, did not mince words: if the squad wanted to wish him a happy birthday, they should get him a victory over Cambodia in the second leg of their Asian first-round 2026 World Cup qualifier, to be played in Islamabad’s Jinnah Sports Stadium later that day. And he added: there should be no cake on his face. “Well, they ended up making history. Got me the win and went on to smash two cakes in my face,” Constantine laughingly recalled to Al Jazeera in an exclusive interview. The 1-0 victory wasPakistan’s first winin three decades of World Cup qualifiers; a monumental achievement for the team and Constantine himself, who had taken over as coach only days before their first leg in Cambodia. Pakistan’s reward was a place in the second qualification round, in a group including Saudi Arabia, Tajikistan, and Jordan. Pakistan’s opener is a trip to play Saudi Arabia in the eastern city of Al Hofuf on Thursday. “I can only speak for myself, and for however long I am here, but the days of Pakistan rolling over for any opposition are gone,” the bald, bespectacled coach said with a steely resolve. “If you want to beat us, you will have to earn that. We are not going to lay down easily.” Shaheens have landed in Saudi Arabia 🇸🇦#pakistanfootball#dilsayfootball#shaheens#weare26pic.twitter.com/iKFsUNzmVY — Pakistan Football Federation (@TheRealPFF)November 11, 2023   Before their World Cup qualifiers against Cambodia, Pakistan were on a 13-match losing streak dating back to 2018. The Pakistan Football Federation (PFF) has been banned by FIFA, football’s world governing body, for political interference twice in the last six years. The country hasn’t had a functional football league for more than a year due to a lack of funds and infrastructure issues. “For that first game, I had a group of players of whom half hadn’t been training at all due to lack of football league, and the other half of them didn’t remember the last time they played in a competitive game,” the London-born Englishman said. Despite facing such adversity, Constantine’s charges were able to get a 0-0 draw in Phnom Penh. “With a little bit of luck, could have even stolen it,” he said. Constantine brings a wealth of experience and pedigree to the job. Before joining Pakistan, he had coached the national sides of Nepal, Malawi, Sudan, Rwanda, and India (twice). His most successful tenure was with India during his second stint, taking them from 173rd in FIFA’s world rankings in 2015 to 97th by the end of 2018. The following year, India qualified for the Asia Cup for only the fourth time in their history, with the second youngest squad in the tournament. “I was coaching India when we played Pakistan in September 2018, when we destroyed them 3-1, which should have been a lot more. From that squad, 14 boys eventually made it to the team which qualified for the Asian Cup. My focus has always been developing the youth team,” the coach said. Constantine recognises the challenges faced by Pakistan, 193rd in FIFA’s rankings, in their match against Saudi Arabia, who last year shocked eventual winners Argentina 2-1 during their group stage match in the World Cup in Qatar. The Green Falcons are currently ranked 57th in the world and are coached by legendary Italian managerRoberto Mancini.      Constantine urged Pakistan fans to keep their expectations in check. “I am sure it is going to be an extremely difficult game. They will put us under pressure from the first minute. I have already heard some predictions of the potential scoreline. In games like these, you just need to avoid conceding early and see how it goes. I promise we will fight,” Constantine said in a matter-of-fact tone. He also stressed that it’s a huge opportunity for Pakistan’s footballers to gain experience, and can help tap into the growing popularity of the game in Pakistan. “One of the things I said to the boys before we played Cambodia in Islamabad, is that these are the games that you want to be part of. This game will literally decide the future of Pakistan’s football. Had we not won, I really don’t know what would happen going forward.”      For a country that had been starved of international football for a long time under the FIFA bans, the second round of qualifiers guarantees at least six matches. After Saudi Arabia, Pakistan are set to play against Tajikistan in Islamabad on November 21, while the remaining qualification matches will be played next year in March and June. The top two qualify for the third round of qualifiers, in which 18 teams are split between three groups. But considering the upheaval and uncertainty in Pakistan football, planning for the future is not for the faint-hearted. In fact, Constantine’s contract ended after the win against Cambodia and has only been extended until March, as the FIFA-led Normalisation Committee of the PFF is expected to hold elections for the federation that month. The Englishman was pragmatic about the uncertainties, saying that all he can do is put in the hard work, and try to get Pakistan back to “where it should be”. He stressed that the country needs a functioning football league that allows players from different age groups to constantly compete and develop, and only that would unlock the country’s true potential. “Look, I am a realist. We are not going to the World Cup. We are not ready for that. We could possibly lose all six of these games. But these six matches will shape how we are going to be as a team going forward, and I am here for that,” he said. “I want to build for the future, not the past. I do not care how old you are. All I care about is: can you do what this team needs?”          Follow Al Jazeera English:","Stephen Constantine is the head coach of the Pakistan men's football team.

"By Marko Protic November 15, 2023 For three decades, the West and the international community saw the idea of two states — one Israeli, one Palestinian — as the basis for peace in the Middle East. Even after Hamas' October 7 massacre and Israel's overwhelming counter-offensive, many believe it remains the only path forward. More than 1,200 people were killed and 242 abducted in the attack on Israel by Hamas, a U.S.-designated terrorist organization. Israel's military response has claimed more than 11,000 lives, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. Yet political scientist Uriel Abulof of Tel Aviv University believes the massive loss of life on both sides has not made peace impossible. ""A two-state solution is still possible, perhaps more than before, because there is a potential for both sides to understand that this is not a conflict between the majority of Israelis and Palestinians, [both of whom] want to live in coexistence, without radical leaders,"" he said. ""On one side you have Hamas, which you have to deal with militarily, and on the other side are Benjamin Netanyahu and his coalition, which need to be dealt with politically,"" he told VOA. ""If this happens — and I put a big question mark there — there are better chances for a solution."" Hussein Ibish of the Washington-based Arab Gulf States Institute also believes that a permanent solution to the decades-long conflict is possible only with a two-state model. ""Maybe it will have to be done in stages, but with two states as a common goal that is explicitly outlined from the beginning,"" said Ibish, who believes even that initial step has specific prerequisites. ""Israel must finally and formally accept the Palestinian right to a state and the need for it. The construction and establishment of settlements must stop completely,"" he said. Conversely, Ibish told VOA, Palestinians need to condemn the Hamas attacks of October 7 and vow cessation of hostilities, while the Palestinian Authority must be politically strengthened. Actionable plan or fig leaf? Other experts are skeptical. Omer Bartov, a professor of Holocaust and genocide studies at Brown University, describes the two-state plan as a proverbial fig leaf. ""People talk about a two-state solution because they have to talk about something, and that's the only plan currently on the table,"" he told VOA. ""Only Palestinians would live in a Palestinian state, and only Jews would live in Israel."" Bartov believes the two-state plan is unrealistic because it would make for an economically weak Palestine that is dependent on Israel, and ""because there are between half-a-million and 750,000 Jewish settlers in the West Bank, and their removal from the territory would mean civil war."" He notes there are also 2 million Palestinians who already live in Israel. Israel captured the West Bank, along with East Jerusalem, from Jordan in the Six-Day War of 1967. It took Gaza from Egypt in the same war but withdrew from the territory in 2005. ""There is another option, and it was talked about before this happened,"" said Bartov. ""It is not something that can happen quickly, but the possibility should be considered. And that is a kind of confederation of Israeli and Palestinian states, within the borders of 1967."" A single confederated state, he said, would enable the return of Palestinian refugees whose ancestors left certain territories in 1948, and ""Jerusalem could be the common capital."" ""There would be a difference between citizenship and residence,"" said Bartov. ""Jewish settlers could continue to live in the Palestinian state but behave according to its regulations. And the Palestinians could return from exile and live, for example, in Haifa."" The single-state solution ""currently seems like madness"" given the current hostilities, he said, adding that continuing violence leads only to ""the erosion of democracy in Israeli society"" along with the surfacing of ""authoritarian"" and even ""racist elements."" US role seen as crucial Ibish of the Arab Gulf States Institute says U.S. involvement would be crucial to any permanent solution to the conflict. ""The U.S. is the only foreign power that has the influence and power to be the guarantor of [a two-state] peace agreement,"" he said. ""Unfortunately, the U.S. domestic political scene undermines its role in this regard because it is politically too expensive to put serious pressure on Israel."" Abulof of Tel Aviv University says President Joe Biden must take the lead and use the ""stick and carrot"" principle for both sides. ""He can tell Israel that he will fully support them and give them security guarantees, and take care of Iran and Hezbollah,"" said Abulof, adding that Biden would then need to promise U.S.-financed ""democratization to the Palestinians."" If Israel doesn't agree to this plan, he says, the U.S. could threaten not to use its veto power in the U.N. Security Council to stop anti-Israeli resolutions. Bartov of Brown University agrees that no plan can be implemented without the U.S. support on which Israel depends politically and militarily. Without it, he suggested, the nightmare of endless warfare only continues. ""It's kind of a dream for both Jews and Palestinians — many hope that they'll just wake up one morning and find that the other side is gone,"" he said. ""But no one leaves. Everyone is there, making life miserable for each other and living in fear. They really don't feel there is hope. That's why the perspective must be changed — how to make these two groups of people live side by side, not apart.""","More than 1,200 people were killed and 242 abducted in the attack on Israel by Hamas.

"Harrison Ford as Dr. Richard Kimble in an iconic scene from 'The Fugitive.' It's 30 years since The Fugitive landed in theaters. It became an instant classic, landing seven Oscar nominations, including Best Picture. It held the box office top spot for six weeks and set a new record for having the biggest August opening weekend ever – the film held that title for six years. The Fugitive grossed $368.9 million at the worldwide box office against a budget of $44 million, and it played in theaters for months. The movie was, and still is, a big deal. ""I was suddenly aware that people were watching our movie all over the world. It was fantastic,"" recalled director Andrew Davis. ""It's interesting because I'll probably be remembered as the director of The Fugitive, no matter what films I make in the future or have made in the past. Holes seems to be that way with kids, but The Fugitive was definitely a landmark moment.""  ""It's because of your empathy for the characters and the style that we were able to make the film with. It's got a tremendous pace, a great score, and tremendous performances, so with all that, it engages people in a way where they really care what's going to happen to these guys."" In The Fugitive, Harrison Ford plays Dr. Richard Kimble, a man framed for the murder of his wife. He goes on the run to find the real killer and clear his name, but hot on his tail is grizzled and tenacious U.S. Marshal Samuel Gerard, played by Tommy Lee Jones, whose performance won him the Best Supporting Actor Oscar. ""The Fugitive was based upon a solid premise: it's not just the accused man; it's Les Misérables, so it had a strong spine. Harrison, Tommy, and I did not sit at home in the 60s and watch The Fugitive TV show. I was not that aware of it,"" Davis confessed. ""I watched a few episodes, saw the train crash, and said, 'Okay, let's just take that setup and the unjustly accused man and develop an interesting and exciting thriller based upon that concept.' That was it."" Jones and Harrison are both incredible in The Fugitive. However, the director is quick to remind everyone that the dynamite pair actually only share a few scenes. ""They have very few moments together, so they're carrying this movie down the track separately,"" Davis explained. ""You want them to resolve this conflict, and you're happy at the end of the movie when they walk out of that hotel, and Harrison realizes that this guy will not shoot him or put him in jail again. They are two amazing leading men, perfect for this movie, and it would be wonderful to do another movie with them."" It's a pairing he's keen to reunite. ""They're older now, so you'd have to adapt to that, but it's up to me to come up with a project that somebody wants to make with the two of them,"" Davis mused. ""Who knows how hard it is to get a movie like that made today? They say they don't make movies like this anymore, and yet this thing is still keeping the money rolling in for Warner Bros."" Tommy Lee Jones as U.S. Marshal Samuel Gerard, a performance won him the Best Supporting Actor ... [+] Oscar. As part of the 30th anniversary celebrations, The Fugitive has been remastered in 4K. It's a process the filmmaker had a hand in, and he loved every minute. ""I was never able to remaster a movie like this before,"" he lamented. ""The technology is different now, and I had access to the original negative, all these digital tools, and then there was also the remastering of the soundtrack. The picture looks better than it ever has and looks better than it will ever look in a movie theater. If you watch this 4K version on a 65-inch monitor, it's unbelievable. We could go in there, dig out things in the image like making faces have more texture, make things colder, and even reframe certain things."" ""Soundwise, the score is soaring now. James Newton Howard's score is orchestral in some places, and it's also very funky. The legendary sax player Wayne Shorter is on the score. James brought some amazing players besides his orchestra to make this thing soar."" One of The Fugitive's best-loved scenes happened early in Kimble's break for freedom when he escapes a train crash by the skin of his teeth. Seeing Ford avoiding the imminent danger posed by a fast-moving object is reminiscent of the boulder scene in Raiders of the Lost Ark. Was that an intentional homage? ""I didn't see that at the time, but there's also some North by Northwest in there, too,"" David recalled. ""I didn't study that scene and say, 'Okay, this is what it's going to be,' we just wanted to make it real. Something happened, and he's running away. The logic is a little twisty because the train goes off the track, and then the train is still coming, but the train had to break apart so another part could be coming after him, so it was also smoke and mirrors with how that scene worked. And yet, when that train finally settles, you go, 'Oh, my God, this guy survived.'"" Legend has it that Davis used 13 cameras to capture that scene. ""Honestly, it was maybe even more than that,"" he confessed. ""I don't know exactly. It was probably at least that because we had cameras buried in the mud and stuff that we never found."" Harrison Ford at the 'The Fugitive' Los Angeles Premiere at Mann Village in Westwood, California. As well as multiple iconic set pieces, Kimble's beard was a character element born out of a chance meeting and caused furious discussion at the studio as it hid the star's face. ""We were having dinner in Chicago before the movie started shooting. I don't remember when he started growing that beard, but we met a doctor through my assistant at the time, Teresa Tucker-Davies."" the director said. ""This doctor had an apartment, a beautiful modern home, nearby. After I met him at dinner, we went back to his place, and Harrison said, 'This is the doctor I want to be.' We took the art off the walls and recreated the apartment that he has with Sela Ward, who played Helen Kimble, which is a copy of that real doctor's place. The beard was perfect because Harrison wanted Richard Kimble to be a little bohemian."" ""It also meant he could take it off to be another person when he was hiding, so it made total sense. Bob Daly at Warner Bros. said, 'Get that beard off him,' but it was perfect timing because they were in the hospital, and he could shave, and Richard could be somebody else."" The script was incomplete when Davis started filming, but the director used that to his advantage. ""I would rather have a perfect script that I could play with and improvise on, but this was a challenge,"" the filmmaker recalled. ""There was some excellent writing done before we started shooting. At the same time, it opened the door for Tommy Lee, Harrison, Joe Pantoliano, and everyone else to contribute to what we were doing. You can think and write in front of a computer all day, but on the set the day of filming, you've got to make magic, and if it's not happening, you have to change things. That’s normal. I remember Kubrick saying that when I was a young filmmaker. You have to go with the flow and make it better than you thought you could."" The Fugitive is also littered with early career performances from now-household and acclaimed names, including Julianne Moore and Jane Lynch. Also, eagle-eyed viewers might catch an appearance by NBC News icon Lester Holt. ""He was a local Chicago reporter at the time,"" David confirmed, who hails from the city. ""There were several major reporters in that scene. There was also John Drummond, a big crime reporter, and Pam Zekman, another important journalist; they all were local Chicago talent. I used those last two in the Steven Segal movie Above The Law. I have my troupe of real journalists I like to bring with me to things. It makes it feel more real.""","The Fugitive grossed $368.9 million at the worldwide box office against a budget of $44 million. It held the box office top spot for six weeks and set a new record for having the biggest August opening weekend ever. ""I was suddenly aware that people were watching our movie all over the world.

"Sam Altman speaks at the OpenAI DevDay event on Nov. 6, in San Francisco. He has been reinstated as OpenAI's chief executive, days after being ousted by its board of directors.Justin Sullivan/Getty Imageshide caption Sam Altman speaks at the OpenAI DevDay event on Nov. 6, in San Francisco. He has been reinstated as OpenAI's chief executive, days after being ousted by its board of directors. With hissudden return late Tuesdayafter several turbulent days in Silicon Valley, CEO Sam Altman became the latest ousted executive to rejoin the organization he helped to found — in this case, OpenAI, the artificial intelligence company that forced the entire tech industry to reorient when it released ChatGPT last year. After his sudden firing Friday by OpenAI's board of directors, hundreds of OpenAI employeesthreatened to quitif Altman was not brought back. Investors campaigned to reinstate him. And Altman himself had hinted at a possible return Sunday, less than 48 hours after the company's board announced his departure, when he posted a photo of himself wearing an OpenAI visitor badge to the social media site X. (""The first and last time I ever wear one of these,""he wrote.) Then, in a dramatic reversal late Tuesday, the company said it had reinstated Altman as its chief executive and that it would create a new board of directors. Dell CEO Michael Dell (left) in 2013, former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey in 2018 and former Apple CEO Steve Jobs in 2009.Justin Sullivan and Phillip Faraone/Getty Imageshide caption Dell CEO Michael Dell (left) in 2013, former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey in 2018 and former Apple CEO Steve Jobs in 2009. Ousted CEOs who return to their companies, usually after an absence of several years — also known as ""boomerang CEOs"" — are a small but prominent genre of company leader. Often, companies turn to former executives in times of crisis or transition, likeBob Iger of DisneyorHoward Schultz of Starbucks. An outsize share of returning CEOs could also be called boomerang founders, or those who are coming back to the company they helped to found. Among them are Jack Dorsey of Twitter, who was canned by Twitter's board in 2008 before returning in 2015, and Michael Dell, who stepped down from his namesake computing company in 2004 before its board asked him to return three years later. Perhaps no founder has found more fame or success in returningthan Steve Jobs, who co-founded Apple in 1976 and departed nine years later. After his return in 1997, Jobs steered the struggling Apple to the cultural powerhouse it remains today on the backs of products like the iPod and iPhone. But research suggests that boomerang CEOs, including those who were founders, perform worse than first-time chief executives. ""Boomerang founders might be a sentimental story of re-unification between the company and its old founder CEO but the reality points that such returning CEOs make things worse,"" Kalin Kolev, a business professor at Marquette University, wrote in an email to NPR. Kolev and a team of researchersstudied the boomerang CEO effect, comparing the performance of 167 such CEOs to thousands of other top executives at S&P 1500 firms over a 25-year period. They found boomerang CEOs performed ""significantly worse,"" said co-author Chris Bingham, a professor at the University of North Carolina Kenan-Flagler Business School. On average, the annual stock performance of their companies was more than 10% lower than their first-time CEO counterparts, the researchers found. ""Between the time in which they leave and return, changes inevitably occur in consumer preferences, competitors, suppliers, demographic shifts, or the broader economy,"" Bingham wrote in an email to NPR. That dynamic is especially true of fast-changing industries, like tech, he added. And founders face particular challenges as returning CEOs, Kolev said. ""Founders are usually entrepreneurs who possess skills necessary to run a new venture,"" he said. ""However, they often lack the administrative skills to run a larger and more complex firm."" In Altman's case, a return to OpenAI after only several days' absence sets him apart from most boomerang CEOs. And there's no indication he was a poor manager overwhelmed by the size or changes at the company. ""He has been out for [a] few days and nothing significant has changed with the company and the surrounding context/environment,"" Kolev said before the announcement of Altman's return. ""Him coming back might have a calming effect given the strong support he has among employees."" However, Bingham cautioned that ""the organization's internal chaos over the last few days is likely to have a lasting impact."" Fernando Alfonso contributed reporting.","Sam Altman has been reinstated as OpenAI's chief executive, days after being ousted by its board of directors.

Valuation barring certain expensive pockets look marginally higher than historical medians. With decadal high global interest rates, there has been a general reset of valuation expectations; and in such an environment it is quite possible that some of these expensive pockets can correct. This leaves limited scope for re-rating. Flows, especially foreign flows, have been quite uncertain. In such an environment, we broadly expect broader markets to track earnings growth.

Sectors such IT which have gone through meaningful correction in the past 12-18 months and can outperform even as clarity emerges, on global tech spends.

Recovery in rural demand has been weak due to high inflation, poor wage growth and erratic monsoons. Improvement here needs to be tracked. Also, the extent of global slowdown and any further negative surprises on global inflation trajectory is a key risk that needs to be tracked. How should one play the capex theme? Do you have some traction in this space ahead of national elections?  Traditionally some of the sectors that have benefited from the capex theme are building materials, construction, cap-goods and banking. In our mandate of being value manager with a strict governance filter our exposure to this theme is via the banking sector and select building materials names. If one were to look at overall capex activity in the broader economy; it is clearly led by the government with private participation at best being quite modest. And the government has also front-loaded its capex spend ambition for the year. You Might Also Like: Longer term growth for private banks can be faster than industry: Karthikraj Lakshmanan, UTI AMC Incrementally, one has to clearly see the sustenance of the government spending trajectory. Private capex pick up has been quite gradual; given low leverage within corporates, cleaned up balance sheet by the Banks and incrementally better demand with improved utilizations, one can be positive on private capex over the medium term.  With interest rate at around 5% -- how is FII activity likely in Samvat 2080?  Given where the US treasury is trading; for any global allocator, the return expectation vs the past from a developed economy is higher. And in doing so, they also don’t have to take currency risks associated with EM. This raises the ask rate required of Indian equities or for that matter any other EM country. That said, if we were to look at India in the context of other EMs; India stands out in terms of growth and policy stability albeit at higher relative valuation. Near term FII flow is difficult to gauge but we remain positive on India being able to attract incrementally higher FII flows over the longer term, at least in proportion to its share in Global GDP. What does the management commentary of India Inc. suggest for the next few quarters? Any earnings of companies that stood out? Management commentary on most of the domestically focused themes look constructive barring IT, where outlook continues to be weak. Most sectors are seeing a margin pickup driven by input cost going down; this trend should normalise going forward. Despite rural continuing to be weak, there are some signs of pickup in the mass segment for 2W. The banking sector’s results continue to track well, with good credit offtake and surprisingly low credit cost helped by recoveries. With the government focusing on capex and revival in Real Estate, most sectors focussed on these themes continue to report good numbers.  Real estate stocks have been in focus lately – are you tracking this trend? Q) Any sectors that investors should avoid or go underweight after a recent rally? In line with K-shaped recovery witnessed in most consumption themes, Residential Real Estate demand continues to be strong especially in the premium to luxury segment and weak in the low-ticket projects. The government is considering bringing back the credit linked scheme to incentivise the Affordable Housing segment. Over the last few years industry structure in Residential Real Estate has improved; the industry is now more consolidated with few strong developers. Inventory in the system has come down, affordability across cities has gone up and retail demand has remained strong despite steep interest rate hikes. Valuation remains the key concern. Despite trailing broader indices, valuation remains elevated within consumer Staples.  Some of the companies within defence/cap goods are also trading at fairly expense valuations, baking in strong growth numbers over years to come. This leaves no scope for negative surprises.

"A Johns Hopkins materials scientist and a team of collaborators have developed a tiny device that may hold promise for restoring mobility to those with lower limb paralysis, a condition affecting approximately 1.4 million Americans.The novel apparatus, a spinal stimulator, can be placed below the injury site through a simple injection, setting it apart from conventional stimulators, which are bulky and must be deployed farther from the nerves that controlleg movements.""The concept behind spinal stimulators is their ability to bypass injured regions, sending essential motor commands from the brain to the spinal region responsible for leg motions. Our innovative approach addresses a key challenge faced by many existing spinal stimulator technologies: achieving precise stimulation and minimal invasiveness,"" said member Dinchang Lin, an assistant professor in the Whiting School of Engineering's Department of Materials Science and Engineering and a core researcher at Johns Hopkins Institute for NanoBioTechnology.The team's results arepublishedinNano Letters.Conventional spinal stimulators are implanted either on the spinal cord's dorsal surface (facing the person's back) or directly into the spinal tissue. According to Lin, neither strategy is ideal: The former compromises the implant's ability to precisely target important nerves, and the latter not only causes damage to the tissue during implantation surgery but also raises biocompatibility issues.Lin's team first identified a new site for stimulation, the ventrolateral epidural surface, which is very close to crucial motor neurons in the spinal cord and accessible without surgery. Then they designed a nanoscale, ultra-flexible, and stretchable device that can be inserted via a small injector and a simple syringe pump.""Applying this new technology in amouse model, we evoked leg motions using an electric current nearly two orders of magnitude lower than that used in traditional dorsal stimulation. Our stimulator not only enabled a broader range of motions but also allowed us to program the electrode array's stimulation pattern, which resulted in more intricate and natural leg movements reminiscent of stepping, kicking, and waving,"" said Lin, who led the team's design and selection of the device's scaffold materials, which was customized to achieve optimal mechanical properties and long-term biocompatibility.The researchers hope that this technology—if eventually proven safe and effective for use in humans— could someday help restore leg function in people withspinal cord injuriesor neuromotor diseases. They also believe that their implantation method with low invasiveness could make it accessible to more people.""This technology could significantly improve the quality of many patients' lives, lower the cost of personal care, and help them regain confidence and dignity,"" Lin said.Team members plan to continue work on the device with an eye to eventual human clinical trials.","A Johns Hopkins materials scientist and a team of collaborators have developed a tiny device that may hold promise for restoring mobility to those with lower limb paralysis.

"Norway raked in record oil and gas revenues last year after the conflict in Ukraine sent energy prices soaring, broadcaster NRK reported on Tuesday. According to the channel, citing research institution NHH, Norway earned 334 billion kroner ($31.3 billion) in 2022 in revenues from natural gas exports, amid a major disruption in supplies of Russian pipeline gas. “We find the price of coal and Russian supply shortfall to explain the majority of the fluctuations in the natural gas price over 2022,”NHH researchers wrote. The figure accounted for 27% of Norwegian gas export revenues in 2022, excluding supplies to the UK, according to the report. It indicated that 2022 was a record year in terms of Norwegian gas revenues. “It is an insanely high number,”said the leader of Norway’s Green Party, Arild Hermstad, as quoted by NRK.“It is reprehensible that Norway should profit from other people’s misfortune. The government makes it embarrassing to be Norwegian.” The exceptional revenues have led to some politicians accusing Norway of being a ‘war profiteer,’ a label that Oslo rejects.

"at first glance it looks like an ordinary street parade, with marching minstrels, baton-twirling majorettes, painted faces and glittering costumes careering down a battered, rundown johannesburg street. a small boy in a torn t-shirt takes in the sunny scene, eyes wide open and fists on his hips. he was one of several children following the parade, unsupervised and fascinated by the festivities in the gritty neighbourhood. but unlike the traditional minstrel parades in south africa, this procession was joined by some of the poorest of the poor -- the ""recyclers"" who rummage through garbage in hopes of finding something that will earn a few pennies. the display, titled ""no man's land"", was a creation of ""the centre for the less good ideas"", co-founded by william kentridge, a south african artist famous for his drawings and animated films. the bushy-browed 68-year-old is present, wearing his customary white shirt and panama hat, amusedly observing the hustle and bustle, the whistles and shouts. it was choreographer and dancer sello pesa who came up with the idea of the carnival procession to celebrate the tenth season for the centre, whose headquarters are in the maboneng district -- the depressed centre of south africa's economic capital. the artists got ready in the courtyard of this former industrial complex, made up of small brick buildings now housing performance halls and workshops. for the parade, pesa enlisted the recyclers, who normally focus on searching for items like cardboard, scrap metal and plastics to earn a meagre living. ""my idea is to look at ignored societies that feed art, exploring how they can meet in public space. to bring what is thrown away into a pristine, posh area,"" the trained dancer said.

"November 09, 2023 Aboard Air Force OneEn Route Belvidere, Illinois 12:07 P.M. EST MS. DALTON:  Good af- — good afternoon, everyone.  As you know, we are en route to Belvidere, Illinois, where the President will mark the reopening of the Belvidere Assembly Plant, a plant that Stellantis closed indefinitely in March of 2023. Under President Biden, the plant is reopening, bringing back more than all of the — more than all of the 1,200 jobs lost and at higher wages.  And Stellantis is investing in new multibillion-dollar battery manufacturing, which will add over 1,000 more UAW jobs. Stellantis is also locating a parts distribution center in Belvidere in 2024. President Biden will celebrate the labor movement and the fights it has led to increase middle-class wages, ensure record corporate profits mean record wages for workers, and build our economy from the middle out and the bottom up. The reopening is a key result of the historic contract between the UAW and the Big Three.  And it's the latest example of the President's economic agenda facilitating wins for workers and communities across the country. This reopening will create thousands of jobs — rehiring and retooling for EV and EV battery manu- — battery jobs in the same communities where auto jobs have created good-paying union jobs for decades. Thanks to the contract the UAW negotiated, UAW autoworkers will get more in wage increases in four and a half years than they did over the past 22 years combined. President Biden will be joined today by UAW President Shawn Fain, Governor Pritzker, Acting Labor Secretary Su, White House Senior Advisor Gene Sperling, UAW Local 1268 President Matt Frantzen, and Representatives Foster and Sorensen are on the plane with us as well today. Speaking of collective — effective collective barga- — bargaining, this morning, the President applauded SAG-AFTRA and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers for working together in good faith towards an agreement that allows our entertainment industry to continue telling the stories of America. Over the last three years, workers have won historic victories that ensure record pay, record benefits, and an economy that grows from the middle out and bottom up. SAG-AFTRA members will have the final say on this contract.  But President Biden believes the sacrifices they've made will ensure a better future for them, for their families, and for workers who deserve a fair share of the value they helped create.  Welcome news. (Representative Foster walks past the press cabin of Air Force One.) Uh — little congressional cameo there. As you all know, we are also about a week out from an extreme Republican shutdown.  Just 40 days ago, extreme House Republicans marched us to the brink of a damaging government shutdown, then they shut down Congress for three weeks because they couldn't decide who should lead them. Rather than addressing our urgent needs at home and abroad, House Republicans are now wasting time on radical bills that make extreme cuts to Meals on Wheels and WIC, food and water safety, education, law enforcement, and more. These partisan bills break the bipartisan agreement that two thirds of the House Republicans voted for and that they can't — now they can't even pass them in the House. The clock is ticking.  We're just eight days from a shutdown that would undermine our economy and national security, hurting families and businesses across our country in the process. An extreme Republican shutdown would force service members and law enforcement officers to work without pay, risk significant delays for travelers, undermine public health, and cut off funding for small businesses. That is unacceptable.  House Republicans should stop playing political games and follow the lead of the Senate by getting to work on bipartisan bills that deliver for the American people — do their jobs to prevent a shutdown. Finally, yesterday, President Biden directed the U.S. military to carry out a self-defense airstrike in eastern Syria against a facility used by the Iran Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and affiliated groups. The precision strike was conducted in response to the recent attacks that were directed by the IRGC and affiliated groups against U.S. and Coalition bases in Iraq and Syria. We took this strike to disrupt and degrade the freedom of action and capabilities of these groups directly responsible for attacking U.S. forces who are in Iraq and Syria as part of our mission to defeat ISIS.  We're making it clear that these attacks are unacceptable and cannot continue. President Biden and the United States government are fully prepared to take further necessary measures to protect our people and our facilities.  And we want to be clear that we continue to urge against any escalation. Q    Thanks, Olivia.  Two subjects for questions.  First, Secretary Blinken suggested a unity government of some kind under the Palestinian Authority for the West Bank and Gaza.  Why would the people in Gaza want that?  What — how would that work? MS. DALTON:  Well, look, I think, you know, you heard Secretary Blinken yesterday talk about the fact that in the — you know, in the future, the Palestinians deserve — deserve self-determination.  They deserve a say in what their future government looks like. And obviously, we know that the Palestinian Authority is the authority in the West Bank.  And we would certainly expect to see them play some sort of role in the — in the future here. Q    And then, secondly, with regard to the supplemental, I just wanted to clarify: Would President Biden sign a supplemental with funding for Israel with no funding for Ukraine, or does he want there to be funding for Israel and Ukraine in anything he signs together as a combo? MS. DALTON:  Look, it's really hard to get into — too deep into hypotheticals when we haven't seen a bill yet.  But I think we've left no ambiguity about our position here, which is that we want to see — we want to see Congress move forward on funding critical priorities. It's critical to America's national security that Congress support Israel and Ukraine in their fights against terrorism and tyranny.  And we've got to help millions of innocent civilians devastated by Putin's war in Ukraine and the conflict between Israel and Hamas. So, what we have said was: We will not accept a standalone Israel-only bill that abandons Ukraine, fails to stand up to Putin and his brutal aggression, and doesn't provide urgent humanitarian assistance. We proposed all of those pieces in our supplemental because each of those is crucial to our national security.Q    And a follow- — a follow-up on that.  The President told us on the tarmac that he's open to discussions about the border.  Has he entertained any members of Congress to talk about that lately, or — MS. DALTON:  So — Q    — has he reached out to them? MS. DALTON:  So, look — so, what we've said about this is President Biden has supported comprehensive immigration reform since day one.  That's why, you know, he put comprehensive immigration reform forward on his first day in office. And if Republicans want to have a serious conversation about reforms that will improve our immigration system, we are open to that discussion, as the President just said a few moments ago. What we — we disagree with is many of the policies contained in the Senate Republican border proposal they put forward.  And further, we don't see anything in that proposal about creating an earned path to citizenship for DREAMers and others. And so, we believe that Congress should fund the President's supplemental request to secure the border now.  But,you know, as the President just said a few moments ago, he's open to serious discussions on border security.  Nothing to preview specifically there, though. Q    Couple of questions on the UAW, Olivia.  I just asked the President about a UAW endorsement and whether he will be bringing that up with Shawn Fain.  He said they will be ""fine.""  Does that mean he thinks an endorsement is inevitable at this point? MS. DALTON:  Well, as you know, this is an official White House event, so I'm bound by the Hatch Act not to talk about 2024 political events from here. What I can just say is that the UAW — the President is proud to have joined UAW workers on the picket line in Belleville, Michigan, just recently.  And he looks forward to joining UAW President Shawn Fain on this visit. And he's also really proud of the agenda that he's delivered, the fact that he has helped support new investment in our workers and communities, inclu- — including the opening of the Belvidere plant that we're o- — we're going to be visiting today. Q    And then, a quick one.  You know, I also asked him about the UAW's plans to now unionize Tesla and Toyota workers.  And he said he ""absolutely"" supports that.  Does that mean the administration plans to offer any resources to the UAW for such unionization efforts? MS. DALTON:  Well, look, I think — without speaking to this specifically, what I would — I would just make two points.  One is that the administration is very freq- — frequently in touch with the parties as these kinds of labor issues go on.  I would also just point out that the UAW's agreement — the tentative agreement they have in place with the Big Three had consequences far beyond the — the Big Three.  And we already saw that, last week, Toyota announced wage increases for workers in their plants. So, you know, more to come on that. Q    Are Iranian proxy groups getting the message after another retaliatory strike?  They didn't stop after the first one.  What makes the administration think this one will be effective? MS. DALTON:  Well, they certainly should get the message.  We've launched strikes on October 26th.  We followed through with another precision strike last night on a warehouse in eastern Syria. And the takeaway from that is that the President is not going to back down when it comes to protecting our troops, protecting our interests in the re- — region. He won't — I'm not going to telegraph anything going forward.  But he's been pretty clear that he will be swift and deliberate and decisive in going forward if he sees a need for us to confront additional threats, and we're not going to tolerate attacks on our troops. Q    And any more detail you can provide on the four-hour humanitarian pauses that Kirby had mentioned earlier? MS. DALTON:  Yeah, I mean, I think — you know, I think John did a pretty detailed laydown of this earlier.  And I would refer you to the IDF for how they plan to implement and operationalize this. But broad strokes, as we understand it, they're going to move forward with daily four hours in pauses in the north with three hours of notification in advance.  This should hopefully give some room for pe- — civilians — innocent civilians to move out of places where there's heavy fighting going on, heavy hostilities going on; be able to access the two humanitarian corr- — corridors we also announced this morning; and move to places that are safer. We also, in conjunction with that, are continuing to work on stepping up and accelerating the flow of humanitarian aid in from the south to meet these people as they come through those humanitarian corridors. We were pleased to see that 106 trucks got through yesterday.  Now I think we're over 750 trucks total to date.  And obviously, we want to see all of that good work continue.  It's a significant and good step today. Q    Has Israel announced it officially yet — since we don't have Internet or Wi-Fi?  (Laughs.) MS. DALTON:  I — I can't speak to that.  I actually haven't seen, myself, but I know that we've heard directly from the Israelis that this is (inaudible). Q    Olivia, when asked on the tarmac whether the President was frustrated with Netanyahu, he said that it's taking a little bit longer than he'd hoped.  Was he referring to something specific, whether the — the hostage release or the humanitarian pauses?  Do you have any context there of what he's hoping would have happened faster than — than it has? MS. DALTON:  You know, I — far be it from me to go beyond the President.  But I'm happy to take that and get back to you. My assumption that — was that you were — you know, I think your question was a follow-on to the question about humanitarian pauses that was — that he was answering, so — But I will go get clarity on that. Q    Olivia, on the — the President also said that — when asked about the three-day pause for hostages, he said he asked for ""a lot"" longer.  Can you tell us how much longer he asked for? MS. DALTON:  Far be it from me to go beyond what the President just shared.  It's obviously more than we have shared about the details of those private conversations.  So, I'm just not going to go any further at this moment. Q    Can you give us any details on what the President learned yesterday during his meeting with senators who traveled to Israel, Saudi, and Egypt? MS. DALTON:  So, last night, the President had a good, productive meeting with members — Senators Graham, Cardin, who led that CODEL of senators to Israel, to Saudi Arabia, and to Egypt.  They had a conversation about the latest on the situation on the ground in Israel and Gaza. I can also tell you that the President raised at the end with this group the importance of continuing to fund — provide funding to Ukraine to make sure that they have everything that they need to meet their battlefield needs in the fate of — in the face of Russia's brutal aggression and to meet the humanitarian needs on the ground there. So, just wanted to add that he had, you know, also raised that in the context of last night's discussion. Q    There's been suspicious white powder sent to election offices in Washington State.  Is the White House tracking that at all or paying attention? MS. DALTON:  This is the first I'm hearing of it, but that doesn't mean that our folks are not tracking this.  But I would refer you — Q    Is that something you could circle back with? MS. DALTON:  I'm happy to take the question and follow up. Q    Olivia, a group of Senate Democrats have sent the White House a letter asking for assurances on the steps Israel is taking to mitigate civilian casualties.  They want transparency around the weapons they're being asked to approve.  Is that something the White House is willing to entertain? MS. DALTON:  Well, look, the — what I'll say is the White House, the President, National Security Advisor, Secretary Blinken, Secretary Austin, members of this administration have continued to have very direct conversations about — with Israeli counterparts at every level to discuss very directly the importance of minimizing civilian casualties and the expectation that our arms are provi- — you know, any arms we provide, those are provided, you know, with the — on the expectation that recipients will comply with international humanitarian law and the rules of war, so — and the laws of war. So, that is something that we've communicated at all levels very directly, and we'll continue to do so. Q    Olivia, two quick questions.  One, did the President watch the Republican debate last night — do you know? MS. DALTON:  I know that this meeting with the — you know, the senators who came over ran into the evening.  I know he was in the Oval Office until after 9:00 p.m. last night.  So, I don't know if he was able to catch any of it after he finished working. Happy to find out more, but he was in the — in the Oval Office working pretty late last night. Q    And then on the decision for the FBI headquarters to move to Greenbelt, Maryland.  Can you discuss anything about the President's involvement in that decision? MS. DALTON:  This was a GSA-led process.  The GSA worked to implement their best practices around their site selection process.  They also implemented the — you know, came to a final decision based on site selection criteria that — that was in place in consultation between GSA and FBI from the outside with input — outset with input from outside stakeholders. I can tell you it was a fair and transparent process.  The Greenbelt location was determined after reviewing that the loca- — the 61 acres in Greenbelt is both the lowest cost to taxpayers, most transportation options for FBI workers, and we had the most assurances about the expeditiousness with which the project could get underway. So, a lot of criteria there.  For anything further, though, I would refer you to GSA, which has been really leading the process. Q    Anything you could say about reports of resumption of military-to-military communication between the U.S. and China? MS. DALTON:  I don't have anything for you on that right now.  Happy to take it, though. Q    Is there anything you can tell us about Ambassador Jack Lew's first week, ho- — his role in all of these talks, you know, just anything about what's been going on with the ambassador since he's been confirmed and sworn in? MS. DALTON:  It's — I'm sure it's been a busy first week.  I don't have a — you know, a rundown of everything he's done this past week.  But I'm also happy to take that and circle back with you. Q    Anything you can say about the disconnect between the President's approval ratings and the victories Democrats had earlier this week? MS. DALTON:  Well, look, polls don't matter; elections matter.  You know, and now we've seen three resounding outcomes — in 2020, in 2022, and in 2023 — that voters have overwhelmingly marched to the polls, rejected extreme policies that, you know, roll back women's fundamental reproductive rights; that, you know, sell — sell out middle-class Americans to rig the system for the wealthy; and, you know, threaten cuts to things like Social Security and Medicare. Instead, reporter- — voter — not reporters; you guys are a different crew — voters have repeatedly embraced the President's policies, which put middle-class Americans first and end generations of trickle-down economics that didn't deliver for the American people. Just two nights ago, we saw, yet again, evidence that the American people are embracing the President's policies, are embracing the progress we're making, and their rejecti- — rejecting the sort of politics of hate and division and fear that we're continuing to see from Republican lawmakers — continuing to reject these calls for extreme national abortion bans, for cuts to Medicare and Social Security, and the kind of doubling down that we've continued to see despite what overwhelmingly Americans have said that they want. Q    Just a housekeeping question.  I see we have a guest stenographer.  Will there still be transcripts from — MS. DALTON:  Yes. Q    — this trip? MS. DALTON:  Yes. Q    Okay. MS. DALTON:  Okay.  Thanks, everybody. Q    Thank you. 12:27 P.M. EST","Air Force One is en route to Belvidere, Illinois, where the President will mark the reopening of a plant.

Focus fivecategories of Scope 3 GHG emissions (categorized according to the Greenhouse Gas Protocol corporate value chain (Scope 3) accounting and reporting standard and the GRI-305 Sustainability Reporting Standard) are (1) purchased goods and services (Category 1), which include impacts of upstream transportation and distribution (Category 4) and waste generated in operations (Category 5), (2) fuel- and energy-related activities (Category 3), (3) processing of sold products (Category 10), (4) use of sold products (Category 11) and (5) end-of-life treatment of sold products (Category 12). Free Cash Flowis equal to cash flows from operating activities (excluding cash flows linked to acquisitions or disposals of subsidiaries and cash outflows of voluntary pension contributions, as they are deleveraging in nature as a reimbursement of debt and cash flows related to internal management of portfolio such as one-off costs of internal carve-outs and related taxes), cash flows from investing activities (excluding cash flows from or related to the acquisitions and disposals of subsidiaries, and cash flows associated with the partial demerger project) and other investments, and excluding loans to associates and non-consolidated investments, and recognition of factored receivables and increase/decrease of borrowings related to environmental remediation. In addition, because leases are generally considered to be operating in nature, free cash flow incorporates the payment of the lease liability (excluding the interest expense) recorded in cash flow from financing activities in accordance with IFRS 16. Levered (Pre-Capital Expenditures) Cash Flowis defined as Free Cash Flow after payment of net interests, coupons of perpetual hybrid bonds and dividends to non-controlling interests, but before capital expenditures. ROCEis calculated as the ratio between Underlying EBIT (before adjustment for the amortization of purchase price allocation) and capital employed. Capital employed consists of net working capital, tangible and intangible assets, goodwill, rights-of-use assets, investments in associates and joint ventures and other investments, and is taken as the average of the situation at the beginning and at the end of each period. In future periods, ROCE is expected to be calculated in accordance with this definition, subject to potential adjustments to eliminate material distortions associated with the full consolidation of the results of any joint ventures under IFRS. Underlying EBITis calculated by applying the adjustments to EBIT listed in the Registration Document in Section 9.3, “Alternative Performance Measures.” EBIT is equal to earnings before interest and taxes (which includes the Syensqo group’s share of earnings from associates and joint ventures). Underlying EBITDA Marginis defined as underlying EBITDA as a percentage of net sales. Underlying EBITDA is calculated by applying the adjustments to EBITDA listed in the Registration Document in Section 9.3, “Alternative Performance Measures.” EBITDA is equal to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. It is equal to EBIT (which includes the Syensqo group’s share of earnings from associates and joint ventures), after adding charges for depreciation, amortization and impairment. __________________________________________________________ 1  Refers to Levered (Pre-Capital Expenditures)  Cash Flow.

Key risk factors for consideration The following is a selection of the key risks that relate to the Company’s industry and business, operations and financial condition, based on the probability of their occurrence and the expected magnitude of their negative impact. In making this selection, the Company has considered circumstances such as the probability of the risk materializing on the basis of the current state of affairs, the potential impact that the materialization of the risk could have on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects, and the attention that management would on the basis of the current expectations have to devote to these risks if they were to materialize. The risk factors listed below should not be regarded as a complete and comprehensive statement of all potential risks and uncertainties that the Company faces. Please refer to Chapter 1, “Risk factors” of the Registration Document and Chapter 1, “Risk factors related to the shares being admitted to trading” of the Securities Note for additional information. Cautionary statements concerning forward-looking statements Certain statements contained herein may be forward-looking statements including, but not limited to, the statements about the Partial Demerger, as well as other statements that are predictions of or indicate plans, strategies, goals, future events or intentions. In particular, these statements relate to (and include data relating to) Company management’s business strategies, capital expenditures and other investments, growth of existing operations and expansion plans, its financial situation and its cash flow, as well as forecasts, other future events, trends or objectives and expectations concerning, in articular, the markets in which it operates, its strategy, its growth and its results. These statements involve risks and uncertainties because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that may or may not occur in the future. The statements in the press release are based upon various assumptions, many of which are based, in turn, upon further assumptions. The statements are not historical facts and should not be construed as a guarantee that the stated facts and/or data will occur. Although the Company believes that these assumptions were reasonable when made, these assumptions are inherently subject to significant known and unknown risks, uncertainties, contingencies and other important factors which are difficult or impossible to predict and are beyond its control. As such, undue reliance should not be placed on such statements. Should one or more of these risks and uncertainties materialize, or should any underlying assumptions prove incorrect, or any other factor impact those statements, the Company’s and the Solvay Group’s actual results, plans, objectives and expectations, as well as the timing and consummation of the Partial Demerger and related transactions, may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. The inclusion of such statements should not be regarded as a representation that such results, plans, trends or objectives will be achieved. Important factors that could cause actual results, plans, trends and objectives to differ materially from those expressed in such statements include, among others, Solvay’s and the Company’s ability to satisfy the necessary conditions to consummate the Partial Demerger, or that the Partial Demerger will be completed, within the expected time frame, on the expected terms or at all; the Company’s ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the Partial Demerger, in full or at all; the expected tax treatment of the Partial Demerger; potential uncertainty during the pendency of the Partial Demerger that could affect the Company’s financial performance; the possibility of disruption, including changes to existing business relationships, disputes, litigation or unanticipated costs in connection with the Partial Demerger and related transactions; uncertainty of Solvay’s or the Company’s financial performance and ability to succeed as standalone publicly traded companies following completion of the Partial Demerger; negative effects of the announcement or pendency of the Partial Demerger and related transactions on the value and future market price of the Company’s securities as a standalone publicly traded company and/or on its financial performance; general economic factors, such as interest rate, currency exchange rate fluctuations and  changing market conditions; competition, including technological advances, new products and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new product research and development; the impact of business combinations, divestitures and restructurings, including any reorganizations to be carried out in connection with the contemplated transaction; adverse litigation or government action, including related to product liability claims; changes to applicable laws and regulations, including tax laws and import/export and trade laws; the impact of products withdrawals; regulatory approval processes; the ability to implement its R&I projects and efforts; the ability to capture any opportunities and market share growth from its principal end-markets or the identified growth platforms, to the extent realized; the ability to identify and invest in value-creating projects and apply its value-based pricing model; the ability to deliver on its strategic initiatives; and the ability to improve efficiency in the use of its existing assets. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any of these forward-looking statements, whether to reflect new information, future events or circumstances or otherwise, except as required by applicable laws and regulations. Financial information included in this press release The financial information for the years 2020, 2021 and 2022 and for the six-month period ended June 30, 2023 has been derived from the combined financial statements of SpecialtyCo (defined as the Solvay business units being transferred to Syensqo as part of the Partial Demerger). The combined financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS from the consolidated financial statements of Solvay SA. However, they may not be indicative of the future performance of Syensqo and do not necessarily reflect SpecialtyCo’s financial position, results of operations, capital structure and cash flows had it operated as an independent standalone company during such periods. The combined financial statements of SpecialtyCo for the years 2020, 2021 and 2022 are included in the Registration Document, and the interim combined financial statements of SpecialtyCo for the six-month period ended June 30, 2023 are available on the website of the Company. Information derived from such combined financial statements in this press release is qualified by the detailed information contained therein, including in the notes thereto. Certain financial information for periods prior to 2020 relating to the business units of Solvay that will form part of SpecialtyCo after completion of the Partial Demerger is presented herein for purposes of illustrating indicative trends. However, the financial information for those business units was prepared on a basis that is different from the basis of preparation of the combined financial statements of SpecialtyCo. Accordingly, the trend information presented herein may be different from the trends that would be shown had combined financial statements of SpecialtyCo been prepared for such periods. Investors should not place undue reliance on such trend information. In addition, this press release refers to certain non-GAAP financial measures, or alternative performance measures, used by the Company in analyzing SpecialtyCo’s operating trends, financial performance and financial position and providing investors with additional information considered useful and relevant regarding SpecialtyCo’s results. These non-GAAP financial measures are not recognized measures under IFRS or any other generally accepted accounting standards, and they generally have no standardized meaning and therefore may not be comparable to similarly labeled measures used by other companies. As a result, none of these non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, SpecialtyCo’s combined financial statements and related notes prepared in accordance with IFRS. For a definition of each non-GAAP financial measure included in this press release and a reconciliation from such non-GAAP financial measure to the relevant line item, subtotal or total in SpecialtyCo’s financial statements, please refer to Section 9.3, “Alternative Performance Measures” of the Registration Document. Certain calculated figures (including data expressed in thousands or millions) and percentages presented in the press release have been rounded. Where applicable, the totals presented in this press release may slightly differ from the totals that would have been obtained by adding the exact amounts (not rounded) for these calculated figures. Disclaimer This press release is for informational purposes only and is not intended to, and does not, constitute an offer or invitation to sell or solicitation of an offer to subscribe for or buy, or an invitation to purchase or subscribe for, any securities of the Company or Solvay, any part of the business or assets described herein, or any other interests or the solicitation of any vote or approval in any jurisdiction in connection with the transactions described herein or otherwise, nor shall there be any sale, issuance or transfer of securities in any jurisdiction in contravention of applicable law. This press release should not be construed in any manner as a recommendation to any reader thereof. The securities of the Company have not been and will not be registered under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and neither Solvay nor the Company intend to make a public offer of securities in the United States. The distribution of this press release may be restricted by law in certain jurisdictions and persons into whose possession any document or other information referred to herein comes, should inform themselves about and observe any such restriction. Any failure to comply with these restrictions may constitute a violation of the securities laws of any such jurisdiction.

"At dawn in this small Amazonian village in Brazil's Para state, flocks of noisy green parrots soar overhead as children run and play between wooden homes, kicking up sandy soil—in places white and bare as a beach.The ground reveals one of the paradoxes of the rainforest.Renowned for its beauty and biodiversity, the life-giving nutrients of the forest are mostly stored in the trees and other plants, not the soil.When the forest is cleared—for a cattle ranch, soybean field or even a small cluster of village homes—the combination of scorching Amazonian sun and intense rainfall combine to leach scarce nutrients from the soil in just a few years, leaving behind surprisingly barren ground. Soil rich in organic matter is black, but here it's sometimes the color of bone. Some ecologists call it a ""wet desert.""Thisimpoverished dirtmakes it difficult to sustain agriculture in one place.And in a region withsome of the highest poverty levelsin Brazil, people with few options have often just abandoned degraded fields and cleared more forest—hastening the cycle of deforestation thatthreatens the planet's climateand the millions of species unique to the Amazon.""The biodiversity is rich, but so many people are very poor,"" said Judson Ferreira Valentim, a soil scientist for the government's agricultural research agency, Embrapa. ""We can't protect the rainforest without addressing the poverty of the Amazon.""Biologists feed Amazon river dolphins, known as botos, in a nature preserve and tourist area on the banks of the Tocantis River, in the municipality of Mocajuba, Para state, Brazil, Saturday, June 3, 2023. Credit: AP Photo/Eraldo PeresThe only way to meet both goals is to find more paths for people to make a living in the Amazon without further destroying the rainforest, say experts who have long worked in the region. That means using already deforested land more efficiently—to reduce pressure to clear more forest—as well as supporting businesses that sustainably harvest native products such as açaí and cacao.Valentim, who works in the northern state of Acre, where he's lived for four decades, points from the window of his truck toareas of abandoned farmland: some are patches of bare soil or red clay; some are overgrown with dark shrubby weeds.The scale of abandoned farm and pastureland across the Brazilian Amazon is massive—covering an area larger than Portugal, according to an AP analysis of data derived from satellite imagery by the Brazilianresearch collaboration Mapbiomas.Other researchers estimate that ranching, which accounts for between 60% and 80% of deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon, isonly a third as productiveas it should be, and that increasing the efficiency on the same land area would more than meet increasing demands for meat through 2040. Brazil is a major exporter of beef to global markets, and currently 43% of Brazil's cattle are raised within the Amazon region, according to an AP analysisof government data.""You have to enforce laws against deforestation, but that's only part of the solution. You also have to give people alternatives"" to improve their livelihoods, said Rachael Garrett, a researcher at Cambridge University who's conducted fieldwork in the Amazon since 2006.There are 28 million people living in just Brazil's portion of the Amazon—including Indigenous farmers, ranchers who migrated from other parts of the country, and settlers forcibly relocated decades ago when the government took their old land for infrastructure projects like the Itaipú Dam.""You can't ignore that millions of people are living there,"" Garrett said. ""The more their needs are ignored, the worse some problems get.""Riverside family boats sit on the beach in the city of Mocajuba, on the banks of the Tocantins River, in the municipality of Mocajuba, Para state, Brazil, Saturday, June 3, 2023. Credit: AP Photo/Eraldo PeresSUPERCHARGING THE SOILNearly everyone in the Amazon starts work early, aiming to finish before the worst of the midday sun. Valentim is on the road at dawn to visit families who've tried new techniques to squeeze more production out of the soil.Dairy farmer Edson Cesar de Oliveira waves from his porch. The son of a subsistence rubber tapper from Acre, his family lives in a small wooden home that he built himself.Chickens cluck in the yard, and clothes flap on a laundry line. Cleonice Farina de Oliveira, his wife, offers black espresso and slices of homemade cheese to visitors.For the past few years, the family has been experimenting with planting a native legume called forage peanuts alongside grass in their pastures. This plant attracts bacteria to its roots that can pull nitrogen from the air into the ground, essentially acting as a low-cost natural fertilizer.While grass-only pastures may degrade in just two or three years, adding legumes may extend the soil's fertility to ten or more years. It's also higher in protein than grass alone, which helps livestock grow faster. And it's easier than grass alone on the cattle's digestive system, reducing their methane emissions.De Oliveria, who said he can't afford chemical fertilizers, has noticed that pastures with forage peanuts don't turn as yellow during the dry season. And cows that graze there for at least two nights produce about 20% more milk, he said.Indigenous Tembe men navigate along the Guama River, in the Tenetehar Wa Tembe village in the Alto Rio Guama Indigenous territory, in Paragominas municipality, in Para state, Brazil, Tuesday, May 30, 2023.

The family provides all the labor on their small farm.On another day, Valentim visits a larger family ranch owned by Luiz Augusto Ribeiro do Valle. Do Valle said the last year he cleared new forest to expand the ranch was 2007. Now he's focused on improving productivity. In addition to planting forage peanuts in his pastures, he has changed the way he grazes cattle.Holding up a detailed map of his ranch, he said, ""You take a large pasture, divide it into smaller areas and rotate where the cattle graze."" The goal is to keep cattle always feeding on new grass, while other areas regrow—the new growth is more nutritious and easier to digest.Cows bray in the distance and dragonflies buzz at his feet as he strolls up a hill, periodically bending to inspect the grass. ""You have to keep checking the plan against the reality on the ground,"" he said. By combining rotational grazing and forage peanuts, he said he can keep between 20% and 40% more cattle on the same amount of land.Potholes in a farm access road force trucks and vehicles to deviate from their lanes, increasing the risk of accidents, in the rural area of the Rio Branco, Acre state, Brazil, Tuesday, May 23, 2023. Credit: AP Photo/Eraldo PeresHARD REALITIES OF THE RAINFORESTBut even these simple innovations can be hard for some poor ranchers in the Amazon to implement.In a region with poor roads and spotty internet and cell-phone service, it's hard to spread information about better farming practices.Many small ranchers can't afford fertilizers, tractors and other modern farming supplies. Anddrug trafficking, illegal mining and violence also make it difficult to work on the Amazon frontier.Of the nearly 1 million farms in Brazil's Amazon region, 83% are small family farms and ranches, according to government figures. Many operate on shoestring budgets.As President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva's government ramps up enforcement of environmental laws—reversing the policies of Jair Bolsonaro and so far curbing overall deforestation by 22%, according to Brazil's national space agency—some experts say it's small-scale ranchers and farmers that are still most at risk for clearing rainforest.""When you have fewer choices, you take bigger risks,"" said René Poccard-Chapuis, an agronomist at the French agricultural research agency CIRAD who has worked in the region for three decades.Cowboys manage a herd of Nellore cattle on the pasture of Fazenda Itaituba, a farm in the municipality of Bujari, near the city of Rio Branco, Acre state, Brazil, Tuesday, May 23, 2023.

He can't afford a horse to ride or hired labor, but moves the cattle between pastures himself, holding a cattle prod in one hand.He said he was unable to afford the price of new fencing to start rotational grazing for his small herd of 22 cattle. Then CIRAD researchers showed him how to use branch clippings from native trees in place of commercial fence posts.The clippings, taken from trees on his property, put out new roots quickly, so he only had to pay for wires—and can now rotate his cattle.TASTES OF THE RAINFOREST: AÇAÍ AND CACAOCésar De Mendes is trying to grow a business in the rainforest without cutting any trees at all.Walking through the forest along a tributary of the Amazon in Pará, he points out bright yellow fruits that sprout, sometimes in pairs, from the middle of tree trunks.Areas deforested for agriculture are seen in the rural region of the Mocajuba municipality, in Para state, Brazil, Thursday, June 1, 2023. Credit: AP Photo/Eraldo PeresIt's cacao, the plant responsible for one of the world's great joys: chocolate.His company, De Mendes Chocolates, uses cacao harvested from virgin rainforest.He's hoping customers will appreciate how different microclimates and soil conditions across the region subtly impact the flavor of the chocolate.""You can taste the different environments,"" he said.His small business sells mostly to upscale groceries and tourist shops. One of six employees at this location, Neilanny Maia, fulfills online orders by hand, devoting a room of her home to storing seed bags and finished chocolate bars.The idea of harvesting rainforest fruits is simple, but scaling up a sustainable business isn't always easy.Just getting fruit to market before it spoils can be a huge challenge. Last year during the rainy season, one road was closed for 90 days. One solution is to build small processing factories near the forest, as the longstanding agricultural collective Projeto RECA has done in Brazil's northern state of Rondônia.Indigenous Tembe family members sit and talk in front of their house at dusk, in the Tenetehar Wa Tembe village in the Alto Rio Guama Indigenous territory, in Paragominas municipality, in Para state, Brazil, Monday, May 29, 2023.

If factory equipment breaks, the team must dissemble it and drive parts several hours for repair. ""We are too far from the big cities"" for on-site maintenance, said Hamilton Condack de Oliveira, the president of the collective of about 200 households.But still, they've managed to survive since the collective was founded in 1989.They harvest from both virgin rainforest and agroforests planted on abandoned pastureland. Planting an agroforest—essentially a large orchard of mixed native tree species—doesn't aid biodiversity and climate as much as simply retaining old-growth forest, but it's much better than tending pasture or monoculture row crops.""People will visit and say, 'Oh that's beautiful,' but it's a lot of work,"" he said.'THE FOREST SUSTAINS US'The impacts of climate change are already being felt locally in the Amazon region, forcing other adaptations.For as long as their stories tell, the Indigenous Tembé people of Tekohaw village have used fire to clear small plots of land to grow cassava, beans and other subsistence crops. After farming for three years, they'd clear new land.A Indigenous Tembe girl walks to school at dawn in the Tenetehar Wa Tembe village in the Alto Rio Guama Indigenous territory, in Paragominas municipality, in Para state, Brazil, Tuesday, May 30, 2023. Credit: AP Photo/Eraldo PeresBecause their plots were small, the overall impact on the forest was minimal. But now the village chief wants to find other ways to manage the soil's fertility.""We don't want to use fire anymore in the forest because we can lose control of the fire, and it can burn the forest,"" said Kaparaí Tembé. This wasn't always as much of a risk, he said. But deforestation from ranching and soy farming for animal feed across the state of Pará has removed moisture from the air, and now the dry season has become longer and drier—heightening the risk of uncontrolled wildfires.""We want to improve agriculture here, in one specific place, not keep burning fields and pushing nature back,"" he said, setting his hoe on the ground and mopping the sweat from his brow. ""We need to nurture the soil.""Earlier this year, the villagers treated the field with a powder made from grinding up limestone . It's a technique to reduce the natural acidity of the Amazonian soil. Today Tembé and two other men are planting a different legume, called the pigeon pea, to add nitrogen to the soil.Later, as he walked back to the village, Tembé heard the raucous shriek of a scarlet macaw.""It's a reminder of where I am,"" he said.

"in a bid to tackle the pressing issue of crop residue burning and the ensuing environmental and health implications in india, sukhmeet singh, the founder and ceo of a2p energy solution private limited, has been pioneering a remarkable journey. through innovative approaches and dedication to sustainability, a2p energy is revolutionising the management of paddy stubble and turning it into green energy. in a conversation with the indian express, sukhmeet singh sheds light on the importance of stubble management and the expansive scope of this transformative business. tell us a little bit about yourself. i’m sukhmeet singh, the founder and ceo of a2p energy solution private limited, based in rajpura, punjab. dr. robert berry and i initiated a2p energy in 2018. with 17 years of experience in green energy, it, agriculture, and strategy, i’ve always had a vision to address climate change. the idea for a2p power was born during an r&d project at the indian school of business, where dr. robert berry, who was leading the european bioenergy research institute, and i collaborated on managing stubble for bioenergy. what began as research eventually led to the establishment of a2p energy in 2018, aimed at curbing stubble fires by converting agri residues into energy products. dr. robert serves as the director of grants and partnerships at a2p. having experienced the impact of air pollution on children’s health, especially indelhi, and as a father of two, i’m deeply committed to making india cleaner and healthier. stubble burning exacerbates air pollution every winter, leading to public health emergencies in delhi. my grand vision is to eradicate this issue’s root cause and create a cleaner, healthier india. a2p processes raw biomass (stubble) at its rajpura facility, with an installed production capacity of 600 mt/month, converting it into green products. how important is it to manage paddy stubble, and what is the scope of the business associated with its management? efficiently managing stubble is crucial due to the narrow timeframe between harvesting and sowing the next crop. burning stubble not only affects public health but also has lasting consequences on soil health. its effective utilization is vital to prevent long-term issues. when crop residue is incorporated into the soil, it reduces the need for irrigation and enhances overall productivity. however, burning raises the soil temperature, harming critical bacterial and fungal populations. this affects soil fertility, leads to increased pest damage, and reduces the soil’s nutrient content, including nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, sulfur, and organic carbon. what is the business associated with stubble? collecting baled straw using machinery generates job opportunities in the agri-equipment sector. the collection and storage of stubble are crucial because it is used as a fuel in many boilers across northern india. stubble is a primary raw material for biofuels like pellets, compressed biogas (cbg), and power plants. this has resulted in the establishment of units in punjab and other parts of north india, creating a new market vertical with the potential to meet a significant portion of the country’s energy demands. what is the size of the market for paddy stubble management in punjab and across india? india produces a staggering 750 million tonnes of crop residue annually. in the states of punjab and haryana, there’s approximately 35 million tonnes of paddy straw left after harvesting. about 30% of this is used for boilers, briquette manufacturing, and cbg production, but a significant portion is still burnt in open fields. our achievements: a2p has garnered recognition both domestically and on the international stage. we’ve successfully engaged with multiple stakeholders in the green fuel supply chain, connecting with over 30 buyers, 50 manufacturers, and more than 600 farmers. in a relatively short time, our innovative approach to addressing on-ground issues has earned us accolades at both national and international levels. notable awards include: 1.cisco’s global problem solver challenge: a2p energy solution (p) ltd secured a $100,000 prize in cisco’s climate impact and regeneration category.2. global makers challenge: a2p energy solution (p) ltd was awarded $100,000 at the global makers challenge 2019 in the sustainable energy category during the global manufacturing and industrialization summit in yekaterinburg, russia.3. india clean air challenge award: act for environment granted us recognition for our efforts in reducing pollution and making a positive impact on farmers and low-income communities. what are your future plans for agri to power? our vision is to expand our clean energy trade platform, enabling corporations to transition from fossil fuels to cleaner alternatives, while also generating additional income for farmers and boosting rural employment. on the manufacturing front, we aim to partner with global companies to establish state-of-the-art facilities for biofuel production. what are your expectations from the government in e this issue? the core objective of our project is to tackle the problem of paddy straw burning, reduce air pollution, and find sustainable ways to utilize agricultural waste instead of burning it. the indian government is already taking significant steps by installing smog towers, promoting electric vehicles, and supporting green fuels and sustainable solutions. we believe our mission aligns with these efforts, and there are a few key areas where government support could greatly enhance our efforts: 1. the government has already implemented a policy requiring thermal power plants to use 5% biofuel alongside coal. expanding this policy to all energy-intensive sectors, such as cement, steel, and manufacturing, would have a substantial impact. 2. standardising the process for purchasing biofuels across all segments by state governments would streamline efficiency and eliminate the cancellation of tenders after release. how do you manage stress as an entrepreneur? my background in sports has taught me valuable lessons for entrepreneurship, including a never-give-up attitude, the notion that you either win or learn, persistence, and the importance of teamwork. additionally, my passion for running and hiking has heightened my focus on environmental sustainability. from my childhood, our daily morning prayers, concluding with “pawan guru paani pita mata dharat mahat” have instilled a commitment to keeping the earth green and clean.","Sukhmeet singh is the founder and ceo of a2p energy solution private limited.

Levels of the most dangerous pm2.5 particles — so tiny they can enter the bloodstream — were almost 35 times the daily maximum recommended by the world health organization. As the air quality worsened, New Delhi’s top officials issued a rare public statement calling for a “total ban” on crop burning, which they blamed for most of the pollution.
The statement comes amid a push for cleaner fuels. India’s government is moving to make it easier to import electric vehicles, while the prime minister has proposed a new national grid to store renewable energy and power them. Still, it’s unclear if the country can achieve its goal of net-zero emissions by 2070. To get there, it will need to shift its energy and transportation sectors, and change the way it makes and uses cement, steel and other commodities.
That will require a vast and expensive transformation, and it’s not clear how India will get there. India’s national grid is still largely powered by coal. Its electricity supply is already stretched to the limit, with demand expected to double by 2030. And the country’s car fleet is already the second largest in the world, behind only China."," As the air quality worsened, New Delhi’s top officials issued a rare public statement calling for a “total ban” on crop burning, which they blamed for most of the pollution.

"The husband of the woman,whodied after she came in contact with an exposed electrical wirein Bengaluru’s Whitefield along with her daughter, is a heartbroken man. At around 6 am on Sunday, Soundharya, 23, was walking on the footpath with her husband Santhosh Kumar near Hope Farm holding their daughter, Suviksha, in her arms. She stepped on a live electric wire and was electrocuted along with their nine-month-old daughter. Speaking toThe Indian Express, Kumar, also 23, said, “After celebrating the Deepavali festival, Soundharya and I came with the kid to Bengaluru. As we arrived near Hope Farm junction to take a BMTC bus, I crossed the road while my wife who was holding the child came in contact with the wire. As I saw it, I tried to rescue them but I sustained an electric shock. They died in front of my eyes. What can be more tragic?”. Kumar, a native of Cuddalore in Tamil Nadu, said he came to Bengaluru a few years ago to pursue his education. He met Soundharya, who was pursuing a diploma in civil engineering. The couple fell in love and got married three years ago. Nine months ago, the couple celebrated after they were blessed with a baby girl.“Suviksha was the only girl child in my entire extended family. My family had seen her for the first time in nine months. But it turned out to be the last.” “Soundharya had discontinued her diploma course and was interested in taking up nursing. She wanted to enrol for Class 12. Her dream was to raise our daughter well but the dream shattered just as she walked on the streets of Bengaluru,” said Santhosh. Their last rites were performed on Monday. The deaths of Soundharya and Suviksha have not just created panic among the city’s residents but they also have expressed their anger towards civic agencies.

"This year's Belfast Christmas Market opened at noon on Saturday, just hours before the city's festive lights were switched on by the lord mayor.  It is the 18th year that the market has been hosted in the grounds of City Hall and many international stall-holders are returning to sell their goods.  The Christmas lights ceremony took place between 18:30 and 19:30 GMT. The ticket-only event featured music, dance and an excerpt from the Lyric Theatre's musical Hansel and Gretel. Belfast was one of the first cities in Northern Ireland to switch on its festive lights this year, along with Bangor in County Down, while other cities and towns will host their ceremonies next week.  More than one million people are expected to visit the Belfast Christmas Market during this festive period. But as traders brace themselves for a second Christmas during the current cost of living crisis, BBC News NI spoke to stall-holders who are selling their wares against a backdrop of rising overheads. Markus Kochems, a wine grower from the Moselle Valley region in Germany, has been selling his produce at the Belfast market since its inception. ""The price of produce, energy production costs and the cost of workers has all gone up in Germany,"" he said. ""There has also been increased prices for stalls in general in the UK. ""Our family business dates back to the 17th century. My dad ran it before me and I took over in 1997. ""I have made many friends here over the years and people from Belfast and Northern Ireland now travel to the Moselle Valley region of Germany - I have heard their voices. ""I don't come here for the money, I come to promote my home region and hopefully attract people from Northern Ireland to go to the Moselle Valley. ""I come to Belfast because it is like a big family here - they are generous people who enjoy life and Christmas."" Andy Pidgen of Market Place Europe, manager of the Belfast Christmas Market, said there will be more than 100 chalets at the event this year, with up to 30 different nationalities represented. ""It will be fantastic as always. Last year we had the fuel crisis but it was probably our best ever event - we never stopped,"" he added. ""It is a nomadic, nocturnal life I lead, but I love it. I like the challenge. ""When you see the people queuing to get in on a Saturday or Sunday, it is all worth it. ""There are 30 nationalities represented this year. ""There are nuns coming over again from a Belarus orphanage to sell their craft items. They could not make it last year, with the war in Ukraine.  ""There is also an elder from a village in Zimbabwe who makes model planes from Coke cans and sells items to help provide in his own community."" Mary Taylor from North Lincolnshire in England, who runs a clothing stall, says ""when Christmas comes people in Belfast pull out all the stops to have a good time"". ""Lots of people come up from Dublin. I love to hear the accents because my parents are from Dublin,"" she said. ""It is nice to renew acquaintances with customers. I love that."" She says that despite increased costs, it is important that the quality of the product remains high. That point is also highlighted by Belfast trader David Johnston, who like Mary has been attending the market for six years. His clothing business OutsideIn helps the homeless. ""For every purchase, we will distribute an item to people experiencing homelessness,"" he added. ""This market in Belfast has helped put us on the map and we have now attracted customers online from the likes of America and Australia. ""Material costs are up, rent is up, energy costs are up; everything contributes to a difficult balance but we make sure we get that balance right and make it work."" Belfast Christmas Market opened at noon on 18 November and will stay open until 22:00 GMT on Saturday night (bars open until 23:00). On weekdays it will operate from 10:00 in the morning but on weekends it will open at the later time of noon.  On Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays, the market will close at 20:00 (bars close at 21:00). On Thursdays and Fridays, closing time is 22:00 (bars close at 23:00).  The market will shut down at 18:00 on Friday 22 December. On Saturday, the market will operate a one-way system.  People can only access the Christmas market by Donegall Square West and must exit by Donegall Square East.  This is due to the Christmas Lights event on Saturday evening which began at 18:30. Belfast City Council has advised motorists to expect disruption, including parking restrictions and traffic diversions, in the city centre this Saturday and in the early hours of Sunday in relation to the Christmas lights switch-on event at City Hall. Event ticketholders, shoppers and visitors to the Belfast Christmas Market have also been advised to plan their journey in advance and leave extra time to travel to and from the city centre on Saturday. There will also be some Translink bus and Glider service diversions in Belfast city centre. More information is available here. Translink has said there will be a return of its night buses and trains over the Christmas period. The late night Belfast bus metro services will start from Friday 24 November and run until Friday 22 December (inclusive). Late night bus and train services to other towns and cities across Northern Ireland will begin on Friday 1 December and run until Friday 22 December (inclusive).

"kenya's foreign minister alfred mutua has been demoted as controversy rages over plans to deploy police to haiti to fight gangs. main opposition leader raila odinga was the latest to oppose the move, saying the deployment would risk the lives of kenyan police.   mr mutua's demotion to tourism minister was part of the first major cabinet reshuffle by president william ruto.  in august, the president criticised some of his ministers as clueless.  mr ruto took office in august last year with the promise to improve the economy and better the lives of lower-income earners. but he has faced a series of opposition-led protests over the high cost of living and tax hikes.  the president said in a statement late on wednesday that the reshuffle was meant to ""optimise performance and enhance delivery as set out in the administration's manifesto"". on tuesday, the president cracked down on government spending and foreign travel, ordering ministries to cut their spending by 10%.  mr ruto re-assigned mr mutua to the tourism ministry and put the foreign affairs ministry under the office of the prime cabinet secretary, which falls under his close ally, musalia mudavadi. the move is seen as an attempt to give mr ruto's inner circle more influence over diplomatic affairs. a senior member of the ruling party, senator kiprotich arap cherargei, said the changes were ""necessitated by performance"".  ""the writing is on the wall for the non-performing cabinet secretaries and those who perpetuate corruption and lethargy in their ministries,"" mr cherargei posted on x, formerly twitter.     as foreign minister, mr mutua was a vocal supporter of a kenyan-led peacekeeping mission to haiti.  he recently said that about 1,000 police would be deployed ""within a short time"". the un security council approved the deployment of the force on tuesday. mr ruto welcomed its decision, but did not mention when the police would be sent. some kenyan mps have demanded parliamentary approval before the deployment.  the defence and security ministers, who have been quiet about the planned haiti deployment, were not affected by the reshuffle.  if deployed, the kenyan police would help tackle gangs that have have taken control of large parts of haiti, killing hundreds and disrupting public services. mr odinga, in an interview with privately-owned ktn news, said the situation in haiti was too dangerous for kenyan police. ""when coffins start arriving here, that's when we shall regret [it]. haiti is dangerous and there's a possibility our police will encounter problems there,"" the opposition leader said. in another notable change in the reshuffle, trade minister moses kuria was moved to the public service portfolio.  he has been replaced by rebecca miano, who was the minister in charge of relations with the east african community (eac).  mr kuria was snubbed by us trade representative katherine tai, who refused to meet him during her visit to kenya in july.  ms tai apparently objected to foul language mr kuria had used against the kenyan media and opposition.  mr kuria was also involved in controversy over the operations of a popular chinese-owned shop near kenya's capital, nairobi.  the shop was temporarily closed after mr kuria accused it of taking away business from local traders by selling goods too cheaply. other key cabinet changes include: mr ruto re-deployed several permanent secretaries and foreign ambassadors. he also appointed former senator isaac mwaura as government spokesperson.","Foreign minister alfred mutua demoted to tourism minister.

"Kamal Kishore Chatiwal City gas  companies will have to shift their focus away from profit margins to sales volume to accelerate the  CNG  vehicle adoption and overall consumption of natural gas in the country, said  Kamal Kishore Chatiwal , managing director,  Indraprastha Gas  ( IGL ). In an interview to ET, he said the government should evaluate subsidising piped natural gas (PNG) supplies for poor households to preserve its competitiveness with LPG, which is attracting expanding subsidies in different states ahead of upcoming polls. ""There is a scope for city gas distributors to reduce CNG prices and focus on volumes for faster penetration of gas in the country,"" said Chatiwal. CNG prices should not be as high as they are in some areas, he said, adding that in some licensed areas CNG prices are close to diesel prices. ""There are two advantages associated with CNG - environmental and economic. Until the economic benefit is realised by the people, they won't convert to CNG,"" said Chatiwal. About 15-17,000 vehicles convert to CNG every month in the areas IGL operates in. ""IGL's philosophy has been to focus on volumes,"" said Chatiwal, adding that higher volume ensures increased revenue and higher profit even if the margins shrink a bit. The government allocates cheaper domestic gas to city gas companies, which compress it and sell it to CNG vehicle drivers at market price. City gas players' fat margins have triggered a debate on whether CNG prices should be capped. ""I don't have the power to fix (CNG) prices. But if the government is giving them (domestic gas) at a particularly cheaper price, I have a feeling that the government could examine whether it also has the remit to demand what could be the end consumer price for CNG,"" Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board chairman Anil Jain told ET last week. High taxes and exorbitant lease rentals for the dispensing sites in some states have also contributed to increased CNG prices, said Pawan Kumar, director (commercial) at IGL. Curbs on diesel buses coming from neighbouring states to Delhi due to high air pollution presents an opportunity for IGL, said Chatiwal. There are about 2,000 diesel buses, which come to Delhi from neighbouring states. And if these buses convert to CNG, their operating cost would fall, he said, adding that the conversion cost of about Rs 4-5 lakh for each bus can be recovered in less than a year. Many of these buses originate or cross the areas in which IGL operates its CNG stations and, therefore, can lead to a revenue boost for the company.

"Israeli troops were ""expanding"" their operation in the Gaza Strip Monday, as Qatari mediators said they were inching closer to a deal to free some of the 240 hostages held by Hamas militants. Israel has warned residents of Gaza's largest refugee camp Jabalia and a nearby coastal camp to evacuate, as the military said Sunday it was ""expanding its operational activities in additional neighbourhoods... of the Gaza Strip."" After intense bombardment, an AFP journalist in Gaza saw columns of smoke rising from Jabalia on Sunday. A Hamas health official said more than 80 people were killed in twin strikes on Jabalia on Saturday, including on a UN school sheltering displaced people. Social media videos verified by AFP showed bodies covered in blood and dust on the floor of a building, where mattresses had been wedged under school tables. Israel's military has said Jabalia is among the areas of focus as they ""target terrorists and strike Hamas infrastructure"". Without mentioning the strikes, the Israeli army said ""an incident in the Jabalia region"" was under review. UN rights chief Volker Turk on Sunday condemned the purported strike on the school as ""horrifying"", adding that ""the horrendous events of the past 48 hours in Gaza beggar belief."" On Monday, Palestinian news agency Wafa said the Indonesian hospital near Jabalia had also come under shelling. Israel launched its offensive against Hamas after a wave of brutal cross-border raids on October 7 left 1,200 people dead, the majority of them civilians. The Hamas government says the death toll from Israel's aerial bombardment and ground operations in Gaza has reached 13,000, thousands of them children. Six weeks into the war, Israel is facing intense international pressure to justify its bloody toll. Israel officials have warned a ""window of legitimacy"" for the war to rout Hamas may be closing. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Monday called for urgent action to stop the ""humanitarian disaster"" unfolding in Gaza. ""The situation in Gaza affects all countries around the world, questioning the human sense of right and wrong and humanity's bottom line,"" Wang told visiting diplomats from Arab and Muslim-majority nations. Israel on Sunday presented what it said was evidence Hamas gunmen used Gaza's largest hospital, Al-Shifa, to hide foreign hostages and to mask underground tunnels. The Israeli military released what was said to be CCTV footage from October 7 of two male hostages from Nepal and Thailand being brought into the hospital. ""We have not yet located both of these hostages,"" army spokesman Daniel Hagari told reporters. One clip showed a man in shorts and a pale blue shirt being dragged into an entrance hall by five men, at least three of whom were armed. In a second clip, an injured man in underwear is wheeled in on a gurney by armed men as several others wearing blue hospital scrubs look on. AFP could not immediately verify the footage. Israel also accused the Palestinian militant group of executing a 19-year-old Israeli soldier Noa Marciano at Al-Shifa and presented images of what it said was a 55-metre-long underground tunnel under the hospital. Israel has repeatedly claimed that Al-Shifa doubles as a base for Palestinian militants, a charge Hamas and hospital administrators deny. The World Health Organization has called the hospital a ""death zone"". Over the weekend, hundreds of people fled Al-Shifa hospital on foot as loud explosions were heard around the complex. Columns of sick and injured were seen leaving with displaced people, doctors and nurses. At least 15 bodies, some in advanced stages of decomposition, were strewn along the route, an AFP journalist said. The WHO on Sunday said it evacuated thirty-one premature babies from the facility. Al-Shifa head of surgery Marwan Abu Sada told AFP that Israeli troops were still in the hospital and it was surrounded by tanks. ""I heard at least two explosions since this morning,"" he said Sunday. Other doctors said the troops were going from building to building and detonated explosives on the ground floors and hospital basements searching for Hamas tunnels. Israel has vowed to eradicate Hamas and to free around 240 people taken hostage by the militants during the worst attack in its history, most of them Israeli citizens but also dozens of foreigners. The bodies of two female hostages were recovered in Gaza this week, the Israeli military said. Four abductees have so far been released by Hamas and a fifth rescued by troops. On Sunday, Qatari mediators said they were inching closer to a deal to free some of the hostages held by Hamas in Gaza. Qatar's prime minister said efforts to bring hostages ""safely back to their homes"" in return for a temporary ceasefire was now within reach, raising hopes that Israeli, Nepali, American or other captives could soon be free. ""I'm now more confident that we are close enough to reach a deal,"" said Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, adding that only ""minor"" practical details remained unresolved. The hostages include infants, teens and pensioners. Their fate has racked not just their families but the Israeli public at large. US deputy national security adviser Jon Finer told US media that negotiators were ""closer than we have been in quite some time"" to securing a deal. But he added: ""The mantra that nothing is agreed until everything is agreed really does apply."" In London, the teary father of missing 9-year-old Emily Hand begged for her to be brought home. ""There's just a big, big hole in all our hearts that won't be filled until she comes home again,"" he told AFP.","Israel warns residents of Gaza's largest refugee camp Jabalia and a nearby coastal camp to evacuate.

"LOS ANGELES --A former gynecologist at the University of California, Los Angeles who was sentenced to prison for sexually abusing student patients can be retried on charges involving additional women, a judge ruled Friday. A Superior Court judge granted a prosecution request to retry Dr. James Heaps on nine charges after a jury deadlocked on the counts last fall. No date for Heaps' retrial was set. Heaps, 67, was sentenced in April to an 11-year prison sentence. He was convicted last October of five counts of sexually abusing two female patients. Los Angeles jurors found him not guilty on seven other counts and deadlocked on remaining charges involving four women. Heaps, a longtime UCLA campus gynecologist, was accused of sexually assaulting hundreds of patients during his 35-year career. Amid a wave of sexual misconduct scandals coming to light that implicate campus doctors, he was arrested in 2019. UCLA later agreed to pay nearly $700 million in lawsuit settlements to hundreds of Heaps’ former patients — a record amount for a public university. Women who brought the lawsuits said Heaps groped them, made suggestive comments or conducted unnecessarily invasive exams during his 35-year career. The lawsuits contended that the university ignored their complaints and deliberately concealed abuse that happened for decades during examinations at the UCLA student health center, the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center or in Heaps’ campus office. Heaps continued to practice until his retirement in June 2018.","Dr. James Heaps was sentenced in April to an 11-year prison sentence.

"Sam Altman, former CEO and Co-Founder of OpenAI  In a surprising and unexpected move, the Board of Directors of OpenAI has fired CEO Sam Altman. Altman said in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter, “I loved my time at OpenAI. It was transformative for me personally, and hopefully the world a little bit. Most of all I loved working with such talented people. Will have more to say about what’s next later.” The 38-year-old CEO’s departure has sent shockwaves through the technology industry. An upbeat message after Altman's departure. On the OpenAI website, the company described the parting of ways like this: “Mr. Altman’s departure follows a deliberative review process by the board, which concluded that he was not consistently candid in his communications with the board, hindering its ability to exercise its responsibilities. The board no longer has confidence in his ability to continue leading OpenAI.” According to reports from The Verge, “this is an extremely sudden turn of events.” Just last week, Altman was onstage at the company’s first-ever DevDay conference, in San Francisco. He announced new updates to ChatGPT, but offered no hints as to today’s news. On Thursday, he spoke at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation conference in San Francisco where he argued that AI will be “the greatest leap forward of any of the big technological revolutions we’ve had so far”, according to The Guardian. Altman is one of the co-founders of OpenAI, along with Greg Brockman. Brockman will be stepping down as Chairman of the Board, to take on an undisclosed role at the company. Other famous-name investors like Reid Hoffman (LinkedIn co-founder) and Peter Thiel (Paypay) were part of the company’s origin story. Other investors in the company included Elon Musk, who later left the organization to avoid a conflict of interest. Barron’s reports that Open AI is valued somewhere near $80-90 billion. Revenues are anticipated to reach $1 billion this year. The company charges companies and individuals for access to advanced features, as a primary source of revenues. Companies that wish to use Open AI’s technology, as an underpinning or OEM model for other technologies, are also sources of substantial revenues for the company. A new report from Forbes says that ChatGPT dominates online AI usage, with a 60% market share. According to reports from The Guardian, Mira Murati will assume duties as interim CEO. Murati has been with OpenAI for five years, and currently serves as CTO. “We have the utmost confidence in her ability to lead OpenAI during this transition period,” the Board said, in a statement on the company website.","OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has been fired.

"malaysia is set to increase settlements in local currencies to reduce reliance on the us dollar, prime minister anwar ibrahim said on tuesday. “to entirely stop the reliance on the us dollar will be difficult, but malaysia will be more active and aggressive in the use of ringgit (in trade),”anwar told the parliament. the process of de-dollarization is gaining momentum in southeast asia. the malaysian prime minister noted that his country now has agreements with indonesia, thailand, and china, its largest trading partner, to encourage more trade and investment in local currencies. the move comes amid a sharp decline in the malaysian currency against the dollar. the ringgit is trading near historical lows and has lost about 7.6% of its value against the greenback this year. numerous economists in southeast asia highlight the increasing adoption of national currencies in international trade, which diminishes the special status of the us dollar. experts argue that the dollar and the financial institutions tied to it have become obsolete and the greenback's role as primary international currency should be critically reviewed. for more stories on economy & finance visitrt's business section",Malaysia is set to increase settlements in local currencies to reduce reliance on the us dollar.

"Portugal's political parties were preparing Wednesday for a landscape without Antonio Costa, who had been prime minister since 2015 but quit suddenly the day prior when he was implicated in a corruption probe. Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, the conservative president, was due to meet with the heads of the main political parties starting at 1100 GMT Wednesday, before deciding whether to ask a party leader to try to form a new government or to dissolve parliament and call for new elections. The main political formations on both the right and the left have said they are prepared to go to the polls. ""The circumstances call for giving a voice to the Portuguese people and organizing anticipated elections,"" said Luis Montenegro, president of the Social Democratic Party (PSD), the main centre-right opposition party. On the left, Costa's Socialist Party is ready for all scenarios ""whether early elections or a new head of government"", said party president Carlos Cesar. After consulting the parties, the president of the Republic will meet Thursday with the Council of State, an advisory body that includes former presidents, before addressing the nation in the evening to present his decision. The prime minister's resignation sent off shock waves in Portugal, with newspaper headlines speaking of the ""end of a cycle"", ""the earthquake of November 7"", and a ""political bomb."" ""Antonio Costa has entered Portuguese political history as the first acting head of government implicated in a criminal affair,"" the Publico daily wrote Wednesday. Tuesday began with a series of searches in ministries, lawyers' offices, and the residence of the prime minister, before leading several hours later to Costa's surprise resignation. He took his decision after learning that his name was cited in an investigation into the approval of a hydrogen plant south of Lisbon and a lithium mine in the north of the country. The probe involves suspicions of ""misappropriation, active and passive corruption by political figures, and influence peddling"", according to prosecutors. Costa is himself suspected of intervening ""to unblock procedures"" in the approval process, and will be the object of a separate investigation, the prosecutors said. ""In these circumstances, I evidently had to resign,"" Costa told a press conference Tuesday, insisting he had done nothing illegal. After winning an absolute majority in January 2022 -- a rare feat among Europe's leftist parties -- Costa has seen his popularity decline after a series of scandals. The departure of the 62-year-old opens a battle for leadership within his Socialist Party. The investigation also led to the indictments of Infrastructure Minister Joao Galamba and the arrest of Costa's Chief of Staff Vitor Escaria and his advisor Diogo Lacerda Machado. They will be informed of the details of their pre-trial detention later Wednesday.","Antonio Costa had been prime minister since 2015 but quit suddenly the day prior when he was implicated in a corruption probe.

"A ""lunar halo"" has been spotted in the night skies. The ring around the Moon was seen over the skies on Saturday evening in Staffordshire, the West Midlands, Surrey, Berkshire, Dorset, Yorkshire, Cumbria, Derbyshire and the Isle of Wight. The phenomenon is caused by the refraction of moonlight from ice crystals in the upper atmosphere. According to the Met Office, the halo can mean rainfall might be approaching. It added: ""The halo is caused by ice crystals formed in high clouds. ""These ice crystals then refract the light from the Moon or Sun. ""As the ice crystals travel lower, precipitation becomes more likely. In summer months particularly, the Halo can be a sign of approaching storms."" Geographer Simon Collins said he was ""delighted"" to catch a glimpse of the moment.

"The Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) paid a ransom after it suffered a cyberattack against some of its US-based systems last week, LockBit, the hacking group behind the attack, claimed on Monday, according to media reports. The breach of the country's largest global lender by total assets, which was disclosed on November 9, disrupted some US Treasury market deals from clearing, forcing brokers and traders to reroute transactions. According to Reuters, a LockBit representative confirmed the payment on Monday but declined to provide further details. “They paid a ransom, deal closed,”the representative told the outlet via an online messaging app Tox. The extent of the ICBC cyberattack was so severe that even corporate email systems stopped functioning, prompting employees to use Google mail, according to the outlet. “The market is mostly back to normal now,”said Zhiwei Ren, a portfolio manager at Penn Mutual Asset Management. Ransomware is a type of cyberattack when hackers take control of systems or information in order to demand a ransom to unlock it. This type of attack has seen a surge in popularity among hackers in recent years. The Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center, a financial industry cybersecurity group, urged companies to“stay current on all protective measures and patch critical vulnerabilities immediately.” “Ransomware remains one of the top threat vectors facing the financial sector,”the group’s spokesperson warned. In recent months, LockBit has attacked some of the world’s largest organizations and has been particularly disruptive in the US. The cybercriminal group has been stealing information and leaking sensitive data in cases where victims refused to pay. The ransomware gang has hit more than 1,700 organizations in the US in numerous sectors ranging from financial services and food to schools, transportation and government departments, according to Reuters.

"A Delhi court has recently granted bail to a man accused of being part of an illegal visa racket, noting that his custody was no longer required. According to the investigating officer, accused Harvinder Singh, who was arrested on October 12, charged huge amounts of cash from persons in lieu of procuring visas from different countries for them. The officer submitted in court that 46 Bangladeshi passports, a Nepalese passport, 40 stamps of different institution banks, and 19 blank stamp papers of Bangladesh among other documents were recovered from the house of the accused. It was also submitted that ‘Bangladeshi agents’ whose names were disclosed by the accused were being traced. The court of Metropolitan Magistrate Devanshu Sajlan while granting bail on November 9 held that the custody of the accused was no longer required as passports and other documents had already been recovered from him. Judge Sajlan observed that since the accused had no prior criminal antecedents, the possibility of him threatening or influencing witnesses was low. It was also held that the statements of the victims of the alleged scam had not been recorded despite a month into the investigation. The court held that other co-accused whose case was ‘not so different’ from Singh had not been arrested. The counsel of the accused said that Singh had no previous criminal history and that he was the sole bread-earner of his family, including his autistic daughter.","Harvinder Singh charged huge amounts of cash from persons in lieu of procuring visas from different countries for them. 46 Bangladeshi passports, a Nepalese passport, 40 stamps of different institution banks, and 19 blank stamp papers of Bangladesh among other documents were recovered from the house of the accused.","On 12 September 2023, Harvinder Singh charged huge amounts of cash from persons in lieu of procuring visas from different countries for them. 46 Bangladeshi passports, a Nepalese passport, 40 stamps of different institution banks, and 19 blank stamp papers of Bangladesh among other documents were recovered from the house of the accused.

"Bhuyan talks to Al Jazeera about his rise to stardom in Bangladesh, his move to Argentina, and upcoming World Cup qualifiers. As 16-year-old Jamal Bhuyan woke from a coma, in his mind, it was still Friday, November 17, 2006. He had a game on Saturday for FC Copenhagen’s youth team and needed to tell the coach that he wouldn’t be available. Rather than passing him the phone, the nurse handed him a newspaper. It was now Sunday, and splashed across the pages of the paper was none other than Bhuyan himself. “She said, ‘You got shot two days ago. Don’t worry, everybody knows that you’re here,’” he recalled. Bhuyan was shot four times, one bullet narrowly missing his heart, after he was caught in the crossfire of gang-related gunfire in the suburbs of the Danish capital. He was lucky to still be alive. Then a promising footballer in the youth side of one of Denmark’s biggest clubs and on the verge of breaking into the senior team, that fateful Friday afternoon stopped his fledgling career in its tracks. He spent four lonely months in hospital during an arduous recovery process. “The doctors told me: ‘You’re not going to play football ever again,'” the now 33-year-old told Al Jazeera in an online interview. Despite undergoing 12 surgeries and still suffering from the effects of the shooting – he has limited feeling and movement in his right hand – being a footballer was his dream and he refused to walk away. Known as a tough defensive midfielder, before moving into a more attacking role more recently, Bhuyan has gone on to become Bangladesh’s record appearance-maker, with more than 75 caps since his international debut in 2013, and became captain in 2018. Jamie Day, his former national team coach, told Al Jazeera that Bhuyan’s achievements are remarkable, especially given his experiences and background. “I think that shows the character and the type of person that he is, he’s a fighter,” Day said. “He’s shown in life that you have to battle. But if you do that and you’re fully focused, and there’s determination and drive that you can achieve anything you want.”      Bhuyan grew up in Brondby Nord, a rough neighbourhood in the outer suburbs of the Danish capital, with his parents, both migrants from Bangladesh, and two older brothers. It was these roots that formed the foundations for his new career, one based in Dhaka rather than Denmark. Although he defied the odds to return to the football pitch, he had to start over in the lower levels of Danish football, before he received an offer to join Abahani Limited Dhaka, one of Bangladesh’s biggest clubs, in 2012. Fast forward to 2023 and Bhuyan is now one of the country’s most recognisable sports stars. “Jamal is arguably the most popular [Bangladeshi] footballer of his generation,” Dhaka-based journalist Atique Anam said. “His presentability, upbringing, stories of his time in Denmark, his communication skills and experience make him the ideal marketable product in football, which otherwise suffers from a lack of interest from sponsors. “Jamal was the first footballer in the national team who grew up outside the country. He had difficulties coping with the culture here initially, but over the last 10 years, he got settled and evolved as the leader.” Life in Dhaka, one of the world’s most densely populated cities, can be suffocating at the best of times. When you’re one of the country’s most popular athletes, that suffocation can be overwhelming. “After I became captain, the whole scenario changed for me,” Bhuyan said. “What I was used to, to go out and be myself, I didn’t have that freedom any more, especially in Dhaka. When I go outside in Dhaka people knock on the car, they will do anything. They will wait for me in front of the hotel. “You know, I came from nothing, and suddenly I became very, very well-known in my own country. So, for me, it was a big change. “And of course when you’re the captain of the football team, you’re like the face of football in Bangladesh. So wherever I go, I get recognised and for me it’s positive and it’s nice, but sometimes it can also kill your freedom to go places.” Despite the attention, Day said being the face and leader of Bangladesh comes easily to Bhuyan. “He’s a good leader, he obviously leads by example,” Day, who coached Bangladesh between 2018 and 2022, said. “But he will let other players know if they’re not pulling their weight. “He is very approachable for the players. He’s easy to talk to and get on with, but he does expect high standards from everyone on and off the pitch.” Bangladesh are currently ranked 183rd in the official FIFA rankings, and while football is popular, it is a distant second to cricket. Bhuyan believes Bangladeshi football is now focusing its development efforts in the right areas – building more facilities like stadiums and training pitches, and developing the grassroots game. “Still, we have a long way to go, but we are on a good track right now compared to five or six years ago,” he said. Not content with being just the national team captain, Bhuyan is now something of an unofficial ambassador for his country in Argentina thanks to his historic move to Club Sol de Mayo in the third tier of Argentinian football in August, when he became the first Bangladeshi player to sign for an Argentinian club. The Bangladeshi love affair with Argentinian football dates back to 1986, before Bhuyan was even born, when the South Asian country became transfixed by Diego Maradona and his World Cup-winning performances for La Albiceleste. Bangladesh’s fanatical support for Argentina came to prominence again during last year’sWorld Cup in Qatarand led to Argentina reopening its embassy in Dhaka, which had been closed since 1978. Bhuyan was present at the reopening ceremony, exchanging jerseys with Santiago Cafiero, Argentina’s foreign minister. After moving to Argentina, he was also afforded a meeting with Chiqui Tapia, the president of the Argentina Football Association. “I remember when I landed in Buenos Aires, there were around 200 Bangladeshis at the airport with big banners and flags,” he said. “I think that the club president was so surprised and overwhelmed about it because I don’t think he realised that he would be able to get so much attention. “Even to my first match, it was full of Bengali people. I think 80 percent of the crowd was from Bangladesh. So I was very honoured and very proud. “I even know that the club used to play in white and blue coloured jerseys, but because of me, they changed the colour to green. So that’s crazy.” As much as it comes with challenges, don’t ask Bhuyan as to whether his status as a leader comes with any extra pressure. “I don’t know about the word pressure,” he said. “Those who have pressure in life are those people who don’t have food on the table … there’s a lot of poor people in Bangladesh that I’ve seen with my own eyes. They don’t have food, they don’t have money. So I think those kinds of people have pressure. “I feel a responsibility to perform well and a responsibility to lead my team and to do my best for my team.” The responsibility of leading his country continues this week as Bangladesh resume their dual qualification process for the 2026 FIFA World Cup and 2027 AFC Asian Cup. As one of Asia’s lowest-ranked teams, their journey started last month with a narrow 3-2 aggregate victory over the Maldives. World Cup qualifiers !#WC#JB6pic.twitter.com/LPrnSJqK1O — Jamal Bhuyan (@Jamal_Bhuyan)October 18, 2023  Even with an expanded World Cup on the horizon, Bhuyan knows qualifying isn’t realistic. Even qualifying for the Asian Cup would be a stunning achievement. Instead, their targets are somewhat smaller. “I think the main goal is to be able to compete with teams who are much higher ranked than us and to give good performances,” he said from Melbourne where the Bengal Tigers will face Australia on Thursday evening in the opener for a tough qualifying group that also includes Lebanon and Palestine. “Of course, if we are able to steal some points and maybe get a win or two, then for us, it will be brilliant.”          Follow Al Jazeera English:","Jamal Bhuyan talks to Al Jazeera about his rise to stardom in Bangladesh.

"Japan has condemned the hijacking of a Japanese-operated, British-owned cargo ship in the Red Sea by Iran-backed Houthi rebels. The Yemeni militia claimed the vessel was Israeli, and a spokesman said the seizure was only the beginning of a ""battle at sea"".  Israel said the ship was not Israeli and a Japanese government spokesperson said it was operated by Nippon Yusen. Japan's chief cabinet secretary said it was working towards the ship's release. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu blamed the Houthi's backer, Iran, for the hijacking. Mr Netanyahu said neither the vessel nor the crew were Israeli and called it an ""Iranian attack on an international ship"". Iran has denied involvement. Japanese shipping company Nippon Yusen - also known as NYK Line - said the ship, named Galaxy Leader, was carrying 25 crew members when it was seized near Hodeida, Yemen on its way to India. Those on board are believed to include Bulgarian, Mexican, Filipino and Ukrainian nationals.  Galaxy Leader is owned by Galaxy Maritime Ltd, which is registered in the Isle of Man. It is owned by Ray Car Carriers, which is co-owned by Israeli businessman Abraham Ungar, according to documents from the Isle of Man Government's Companies registry. In a statement quoted by Reuters news agency, Galaxy Maritime Ltd said the ship was ""illegally boarded by military personnel via a helicopter"" on Sunday, and was now being held at the port of Hodeidah in Yemen.  Unverified video footage released by the Houthis on Monday and aired on the group's TV channel, Al Masirah, showed armed men descending from a helicopter onto the ship. Mr Ungar told The Associated Press news agency he was aware of the incident but could not comment on it.  ""The government of Japan absolutely condemns such an act,"" said Hirokazu Matsuno, Japan's chief cabinet secretary said on Monday, adding there were no Japanese nationals among the crew. He said ministries and agencies were working with the relevant countries for the early release of the vessel and its crew. ""We are also urging related countries such as Saudi Arabia, Oman and Iran to strongly urge the Houthis to release the ships and sailors as soon as possible."" Matthew Miller, spokesman for the US state department, called the Houthi's seizure of the ship ""a flagrant violation of international law"" and demanded the ""immediate release of the ship and its crew"". Mohammed Abdulsalam, a spokesman for Yemen's Houthi rebels, said on X, formerly Twitter, the group's seizure of the vessel was only ""the start"" of its fighters waging ""battle at sea"". Houthi's military spokesman, Yahya al-Sarea, claimed the ship was Israeli and had been taken to a port in Yemen. The group had earlier threatened to target any Israeli ship within their reach in response to Israel's retaliatory military action in the Gaza Strip following the 7 October attack by Hamas militants. More than 1,200 people were killed and more than 240 taken hostage during the surprise Hamas attack on the south of the country, according to the Israeli government.  In retaliation, it launched a massive military operation to try and eliminate Hamas - involving air and artillery strikes as well as ground troops - with the aim of eliminating Hamas. According to the Hamas-run health ministry, the death toll in Gaza since then has reached 13,300. More than 2,000 more are feared to be buried under rubble. The Houthis have fired several missiles and drones towards Israel just after Israel launched its retaliatory operation. The US said at the time that all the missiles and drones were intercepted by its warship in the Red Sea. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) described the attack on the ship as a ""very grave incident of global consequence"". The IDF said the vessel was on its way from Turkey to India when it was seized in the southern Red Sea near Yemen. Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian has recently said that what he called resistance groups allied to Tehran were ""cleverly adjusting pressure"" on Israel and its supporters. Earlier this month, the Houthis shot down a US military drone off Yemen's coast, American officials said. The Houthis have been locked in a prolonged civil war with Yemen's official government - backed by Saudi Arabia - since 2014.

"“Unfair and coercive” buyout practices are putting creatives at “a considerable risk” and legislation must be implemented to stop them, a collective of authors rights groups has said. The Grouping of European Authors’ Societies (GESAC) warned that the buyout deals being offered to creatives by the likes ofNetflixand Prime Video need “legal solutions atEUlevel” to ensure “appropriate and proportionate” remuneration is “effectively implemented.” GESAC, which represents 32 authors societies from across the continent, said this would stop “non-EU-based giant platforms imposing U.S. rules and jurisdiction in their contracts, as it has growlingly been the case.”Related StoriesNews'The Buccaneers' Director Susanna White Talks 'Bridgerton' Comparisons & Taylor Swift, Reveals Feature Developed For BFI About Her Teen YearsPoliticsHow To Watch The Third GOP Presidential Primary Debate Online And On TV Remuneration andresidualswere among the biggest sticking points during the U.S. writers strike, while many European countries have beennegotiating success-based systems with streamersto ensure their creative talent is paid properly for their content. The EU brought in the Digital Single Market (DSM) directive in 2019, which it says safeguards European businesses from unfavorable trading terms. GESAC’s demands come following publication of an independent study commissioned by the European Parliament. The findings recommend legislation to protect authors and composers from buyout deals, which hand all the copyright to their work to the buyer. The study claimed that “widespread” buyout agreements “impact creators, pushing them into precarious economic situations and compromising the quality of their work”, while reducing their “visibility” on the success of their creations. The study noted that opinion on buyouts among creative unions “vary” but claimed “particularly those representing professionals creators highlight serious threats,” and added the “cultural aspects of copyright needs” must be factored into legislation. The study also noted broadcasters and producers usually take a different position, believing more time should be taken to assess the impact of the DSM directive. Recommendations included an “urgent need to review the existing legal framework” around copyright law and directives to “protect authors and performing artists, by guaranteeing appropriate and fair remuneration, freedom of creation and preservation of cultural diversity.” The study says more collective agreements could be sought‚ which “can balance bargaining power,” flagging examples in Sweden, Denmark and Germany. The idea of creating a new legal status for creators in the EU was also floated. For their part, thestreamerssee their investment in European content as opening up a new avenue of revenue for creatives and providing opportunities to strike deals that would otherwise not exist. Buyout deals also provide a significant upfront fee, though this has increasingly been seen as a negative without a residuals system in place to reward success. “The study rightly underlines the disastrous impact of the growing phenomenon of buyout on creators and on the cultural sector, which play a key role in the European economy and innovation,” said Véronique Desbrosses, General Manager of GESAC. “It provides independent evidence and adds to the recent calls from the European Parliament and the Member States for legislative proposals from the European Commission, noting the urgency of an EU action.

"Justin Trudeau to attend virtual G20 Summit hosted by PM Modi amid India-Canada diplomatic row Canada  Prime Minister  Justin Trudeau  will participate in the virtual G20 Leaders' Summit, hosted by  India . The Canadian Prime Minister's officer released Trudeau's schedule for Wednesday which has him joining in the meeting virtually Trudeau's attendance in the virtual meeting comes amidst a diplomatic standoff between India and Canada. Earlier the Speaker of the Canadian Senate Raymonde Gagne skipped the Presiding Officers' Summit of Parliaments of G20 nations that began in Delhi on October 12.  On November 12, Justin Trudeau had reaffirmed his allegation of Indian involvement in the killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a designated terrorist in India.  Trudeau accused New Delhi of violating the Vienna Convention by ""kicking out"" 40 diplomats at a time when his country had reached out to the former and other global partners to get to the bottom of the murder. ""From the very beginning when we learned of credible allegations that agents of the Indian government were involved in the killing of a Canadian citizen on Canadian soil, we reached out to India to ask them to work with us in getting to the bottom of this matter. We also reached out to our friends and allies like the US and others to work on this really serious violation of international law and of the sovereignty of a democracy"" Trudeau had said. ""This is something that we are taking very seriously. We will continue to work with all partners as law enforcement and investigative agencies continue to do their work. Canada is a country that will always stand up for the rule of law because if might starts to make right again, if bigger countries can violate international law without consequences, then the whole world gets more dangerous for everyone,"" he had said. Trudeau, however, said that Canada wants to ""work constructively"" with India, adding that Ottawa ""will always stand up to the rule of law"". In October, Canada pulled out 41 diplomats from India and also halted its visa and consular services in Chandigarh, Mumbai, and Bengaluru consulates in the wake of the Union government's decision to strip them of their immunity. However, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) responded by saying that no international norms were violated in India, seeking parity in the mutual diplomatic presence in New Delhi and Ottawa. On November 16,  External Affiars  minister  S Jaishankar  had responded to Trueadu's claim emphasising that the Canadian side was yet to provide evidence to back its claims on the Nijjar killing. ""Now, in the case of Mr Trudeau, I have discussed it also with my own counterpart. And we have told them, look, if you have a reason to make such an allegation, please share the evidence with us. We are not ruling out an investigation and looking at anything which they may have to offer. They haven't done so,"" Jaishankar said during an interaction with journalist Lionel Barber in London on November 16. Meanwhile the G20 Virtual Summit gets underway today at 5:30 pm. The summit will witness a major gathering of world leaders. Leaders of all G20 members, including the Chair of the African Union, as well as nine guest countries and heads of 11 international organisations, have been invited. The virtual summit will address key issues, select outcomes and review developments that have taken place since the conclusion of the New Delhi G20 Summit in September.Following the G20 Leaders' Summit that took place here in the national capital on September 9-10 this year, considerable progress on major G20 priorities as well as outcomes have been made. For instance, the G20 consensus on tripling renewable energy capacity globally by 2030 and doubling the global rate of energy efficiency improvement by 2030, which was committed to by G20 Leaders in Delhi for the first time, are the key expected outcomes of COP28.

"Agencies If the  oil market  offers clues about the state of the economy, it’s through the prism of two petroleum products:  diesel  and  naphtha . And in  Europe , the news is bleak. The former powers trucks, trains, ships and industries including farming and construction. The latter is used by the petrochemical sector to make everything from medical equipment to chewing gum. OECD Europe’s annual consumption of both is set to plunge this year, with naphtha hitting its lowest since 1975. “Europe’s weak economic growth has hit the manufacturing sector hard,” said Alan Gelder, vice president of refining, chemicals and oil markets at consultancy Wood Mackenzie Ltd. That’s reduced “demand for naphtha as a petrochemical feedstock and diesel for the manufacturing and movement of goods.” The continent’s demand is still critically important even in a world where traders are intently focused on the potential for supply disruptions emanating from war in the Middle East. The expected consumption drop in the two  fuel  types this year is well over half a million barrels-a-day versus pre-pandemic levels — not far off a Belgium’s worth of overall oil usage. As a major importer of diesel-type fuel from the Middle East, India and the US, and a regular exporter of naphtha to East Asia and Latin America, any significant drop in Europe’s usage is likely to have knock-on effects for economies and oil markets around the world. Bloomberg Part of this year’s demand decline is due to long-term, structural trends. Buyers in the European Union have long been favoring gasoline-powered options over diesel, and electric car sales have also hit consumption. But Europe’s economic malaise is a big factor too. Purchasing managers’ index data show ongoing contractions in the euro zone’s construction and manufacturing, while inflation remains above target. Germany’s economy, the European Union’s largest, shrank last quarter and is at risk of entering recession. The numbers on naphtha are stark: consumption is set to fall more than a quarter this year versus 2021 to 844,000 barrels-a-day, the lowest it’s been in 48 years, according to Ciaran Healy, an oil market analyst at the International Energy Agency. While naphtha is also used in blending to make gasoline, the watchdog’s consumption measurement doesn’t include this uptake — instead, the vast majority is for use as a petrochemical feedstock. Run rates at petrochemical steam crackers — huge units that convert naphtha and other feedstock into the industry’s basic chemical building blocks — have plunged, according to data from Argus Media Ltd. Producer OMV AG on Tuesday also dropped its forecast for European steam cracker utilization. Bloomberg Petrochemical giant  BASF  SE meanwhile attributed slower European chemical production to “lower demand resulting from high inflation, increased interest rates, and a renewed rise in natural gas prices” on Tuesday. Diesel Downtrend In the continent’s top five economies — Germany, France, the UK, Italy and Spain — recent data all show contractions in demand for diesel-type fuel.  French road diesel sales fell by 13.4% versus a year earlier in September. In Germany, overall oil demand is expected to drop by about 90,000 barrels-a-day this year, more than any other country in the world — bar Pakistan. Overall, OECD Europe’s diesel-type  fuel demand  is set to be down by about 380,000 barrels-a-day this year versus the 2019 pre-pandemic level, according to the IEA.  Mixed Picture The global picture is more mixed. In China, demand is booming despite the travails of its property sector: during January-August of this year, diesel-type fuel was up by 40% versus the same period in 2019 and naphtha consumption has more than doubled in the corresponding period, according to JODI data.  China has seen massive investment in petrochemical capacity. A jump in production has pushed many of the industry’s products — such as ethylene, propylene and aromatics into oversupply — even as they’ve boosted the country’s attractiveness as a manufacturing hub, said Amber Liu, Asia head of petrochemical analytics for ICIS.  “China has some of the most efficient supply chains — after the petrochemicals expansions — so the prices of China’s finished products are extremely competitive compared to other countries,” said Liu. In the US, implied demand for distillates — which include diesel and heating oil — has fallen below seasonal norms in the past few weeks.  Going forward, the nation’s distillates demand is expected to stay below that of year-ago levels in the fourth quarter before picking up early next year, according to government forecasts.  Still, the trucking industry is showing signs of nascent recovery, and rail freight is rising as well, analysts at JPMorgan said. Naphtha is typically used to make gasoline in the US while cheaper natural gas liquids — a byproduct of drilling shale oil — have become the preferred feedstock for petrochemicals. For Europe, “the outlook for 2024 remains weak for both products,” Gelder said. Experience Your Economic Times Newspaper, The Digital Way!

"washington --chinese middlemen launder the proceeds of north korean hackers’ cyber heists while chinese ships deliver sanctioned north korean goods to chinese ports. chinese companies help north koreans workers — from cheap laborers to well-paid it specialists — find work abroad. a beijing art gallery even boasts of north korean artists working 12-hour days in its heavily surveilled compound, churning out paintings of idyllic visions of life under communism that each sell for thousands of dollars. that's all part of what international authorities say is a growing mountain of evidence that shows beijing is helping cash-strapped north korea evade a broad range of international sanctions designed to hamper pyongyang's nuclear weapons program, according to an associated press review of united nations reports, court records and interviews with experts. “it’s overwhelming,” aaron arnold, a former member of a u.n. panel on north korea and a sanctions expert at the royal united services institute, said of the links betweenchinaand sanctions evasion. “at this point, it’s very hard to say it’s not intentional.” china has had a complicated relationship with pyongyang since the 1950-53 korean war. though uneasy with a nuclear menace at its doorstep, china doesn’t want its neighbor’s government to collapse, experts say. china views north korea as a buffer against the u.s., which maintains a significant troop presence in south korea. beijing has long maintained it enforces the sanctions it has supported since north korea started testing nuclear weapons and forcefully pushed back on any suggestions to the contrary. “china has been fully and strictly implementing the (u.n. security council) resolutions,"" a chinese ambassador said in a recent letter to the u.n, adding that his country had “sustained great losses” in doing so. but in recent years, beijing has sought to weaken those very sanctions and last year vetoed new restrictions on pyongyang after it conducted a nuclear test. this summer a top ruling chinese party official provided a vivid example of china’s ambiguity on sanctions as he stood clapping next to north korean leader kim jong un during a pyongyang military parade. rolling past the two men were trucks carrying nuclear-capable missiles and other weapons the regime isn’t supposed to have. they were joined by russia’s defense minister, apparently part of a new effort by the kremlin, struggling in its invasion of ukraine, to strength ties with north korea. the u.s. has accused north korea of supplying artillery shells and rockets to russia, while new evidence shows hamas fighters likely fired north korean weapons during their oct. 7 assault on israel. but while russia and a handful of other countries have been accused of helping north korea evade sanctions, none has been as prolific as china, according to court records and international reports. “china violates north korea sanctions it voted for and says won’t work because it’s afraid they’ll work. and, also, says it isn’t violating them” said joshua stanton, a human rights advocate and attorney who has helped write u.s. sanction laws against north korea. a review by the ap found a majority of the people placed on the u.s. government’s sanctions list related to north korea in recent years have ties to china. many are north koreans working for alleged chinese front companies while others are chinese citizens who u.s. authorities say launder money or procure weapons material for north korea. north korea has said the u.s.-led sanctions against it are stifling its economy, calling them proof of u.s. hostility against the country. besides sanctions, u.s. criminal prosecutions against individuals or entities assisting north korea’s regime often have links to china. that’s especially true for cases related to north korea's sophisticated hackers, who experts believe have stolen upwards of $3 billion in digital currency in recent years. that windfall has coincided with the speedy growth of the country’s missile and weapons program. an indictment filed earlier this year alleges that a chinese middleman helped launder cryptocurrency stolen by the regime’s top hackers into u.s. dollars. and a similar case was filed in 2020 that accused two chinese brokers of laundering more than $100 million in digital currencies stolen by north korea. such “over-the-counter” brokers allow north korean hackers to bypass know-your-customer rules governing banks and other financial exchanges. north korea depends heavily on china’s financial system and chinese companies to obtain prohibited technology and goods, as well as to acquire u.s. dollars and gain access to the global financial system, records show. “the (chinese) banks are less rigorous because the chinese government is not pushing them,” said former top u.s. treasury official anthony ruggiero. north korea imported more than $250,000 worth of aluminum oxide, which can be used in processing nuclear weapons fuel, from a chinese company in 2015, according to customs records cited in a think tank report. u.s. prosecutors have alleged the same company accounted for a significant share of overall trade between north korea and china; its customers included the chinese government’s ministry of commerce, which was bidding on north korean projects. images from north korean military parades have shown the regime’s nuclear missiles being transported on launchers made with chinese heavy-duty truck chassis. china told the u.n. panel of experts that north korea had promised it would use the trucks to move timber. china regularly ignores reams of satellite photos and vessel tracking data compiled by a u.n. panel of experts showing chinese-flagged vessels docking with north korean ships and transferring goods. north korean ships are banned by u.n. sanctions from participating in ship-to-ship transfers, which are often done to obscure the flow of sanctioned goods like coal exports and oil imports. the u.s. and other leading democracies sent china a letter this summer saying they were “disappointed” that satellite photos continue to show cargo ships that have allegedly been documented breaking sanctions operating in chinese ports and territorial waters. “the international community is closely watching china’s commitment to upholding its un obligations,” the letter warns. china dismisses such findings, frequently saying that its own investigations uncovered no evidence of wrongdoing, without providing any alternative information or explanation. beijing said last year it couldn’t provide chinese port of call records for several north korean ships because the u.n. panel hadn’t provided the ships’ imo number, a unique identifier painted on large vessels. those numbers can easily be looked up using a ship’s name. eric penton-voak, the former coordinator of the u.n. panel of experts, said such excuses were ludicrous in light of china’s vast surveillance powers and showed the ruling communist party’s contempt for enforcing the sanctions it agreed to. “it’s just grasping at any straw“ to avoid providing an answer, he said. when the u.n. panel urged beijing to investigate chinese garment companies that were likely employing north korean workers, china said there was nothing it could do because the tip was too vague. the u.n. panel, beijing said, had only provided the company names in korean and english. china told the u.n. panel in a letter that its “business registration system uses only the chinese language.” ___

"a letter from harvard university student groups blaming israel for violence in the region has drawn a backlash from prominent alumni and us lawmakers.  the letter, authored by the harvard undergraduate palestine solidarity committee, stated that students ""hold the israeli regime entirely responsible for all unfolding violence"".  it was co-signed by 33 student groups.  ""today's events did not occur in a vacuum,"" the statement said.  ""the apartheid regime is the only one to blame. israeli violence has structured every aspect of palestinian existence for 75 years,"" the letter added.  the letter comes after israel says 1,000 people have been killed and 100 kidnapped since hamas militants launched a surprise attack in the early hours of saturday. in gaza, more than 700 people have been killed in retaliatory israeli air strikes. the student statement, posted on saturday, was swiftly rebuked by some professors as well as former harvard president larry summers, who wrote in a post on x, formerly known as twitter, that he was ""sickened"" by it.  ""the silence from harvard's leadership, so far, coupled with a vocal and widely reported student groups' statement blaming israel solely, has allowed harvard to appear at best neutral towards acts of terror against the jewish state of israel,"" the former us treasury secretary said.  harvard university issued its own letter on monday that did not directly address the controversy but instead said university leaders were ""heartbroken"" by ""the attack by hamas that targeted citizens in israel this weekend, and by the war in israel and gaza now under way"".  in another statement issued later on tuesday, the university's president, claudine gay, clarified that the school ""condemn[ed] the terrorist atrocities perpetrated by hamas"".  ""such inhumanity is abhorrent, whatever one's individual views of the origins of longstanding conflicts in the region,"" she said.  she added that while students had the right to ""speak for themselves"", none had the right to speak on behalf of harvard.  mr summers' criticisms, meanwhile, were echoed by several republican us lawmakers, including harvard alumni ted cruz who wrote on x: ""what the hell is wrong with harvard?""  harvard computer science professor boaz barak also took to social media to condemn the letter, asking the university to remove the student groups' school affiliations.  ""i have a lot of criticisms of israeli policies, but everyone who signed this statement is condoning terrorism, rape, and murder,"" he said.  the university's jewish centre, harvard hillel, claimed the statement was a sign of ""further hatred and anti-semitism"".  the groups that signed onto the letter - which called on harvard to ""stop the ongoing annihilation of palestinians"" - included the harvard law school justice for palestine, the harvard jews for liberation and the harvard south asian law students association.  in a post on instagram, the author of the statement, the harvard undergraduate palestine solidarity committee, said its account had been temporarily suspended after posting the letter.   the group called the move ""a recurring pattern of meta's censorship of pro-palestine messaging"".","Letter from student groups blames israel for violence in the region.

"andrew lowther of the norwegian polar institute spends part of each year living in a tent in antarctica, gathering data on the interaction between fisheries and marine vertebrates. during the antarctic summer, you'll find australian andrew lowther, phd., camping somewhere around 60 degrees south. he, typically with another scientist or two, is there to observe and document the populations and movements at sea of marine predators, such as penguins, seals and whales, and assess the potential impact that fisheries have on their primary food source - krill. ""we use gps tags and high-definition cameras to track, in time and space, where adult penguins go in relation to where fishing trawlers are catching krill, for example. penguin chicks are completely dependent on their parents for food and cannot swim yet, so that means the parents are restricted in terms of how far they can go out to sea to get food before they need to come back to land"" he explains.every time a penguin catches krill in the water, andrew and his colleagues can see it. these data result in some rather sophisticated algorithms for estimating the amount of krill consumed by penguins, and the variability in how much they eat, relative to where they roam. ""we can then start to see if feeding rates change, for example whether feeding rates drop in areas where a fishery is operating,"" he adds. andrew describes his job as ""finding out the things that others have assumed to be correct but are not yet tested, or assessing whether the data available are capable of supporting the claims being made."" he says that there is a common assumption that if penguin numbers go down, then the fishery is the only possible cause. while it may be the only variable we can actively manage, he says, ignoring the bigger picture of what may be driving these declines isn't particularly honest. but he doesn't care much for these assumptions., so he spends months at a time in the extreme cold, living in tents on dehydrated food, to collect data to test them. it's not what you take, it's where you take it fromits widely accepted that at a circumpolar level, there are hundreds of millions of tons of krill. at scales relevant to what the fishery operates over, a multinational survey conducted in 2018 failed to detect a change in the krill biomass around the western antarctic peninsula and scotia sea over the last 20-years. ""with a catch rate of less than 1% of the biomass, the krill fishery has had almost no impact from a global context. it's a drop in the bucket,"" he explains. ""however, if you take krill from a small area where constrained predators such as penguins and fur seals need it, then you could potentially have a disproportionate impact. so, it's not what you take, it's where you take it from."" what andrew describes is the 'spatial management' of marine resources to reduce the risk of these impacts. he looks at how those resources overlap with fisheries at key times and places, just as he does with penguins and seals. the issue, he says, has never really been about how much krill there is, but rather how removing it from a relatively small area can affect the ecosystem around it. that's why a coalition of krill harvesting companies (ark) in 2018 took their precautionary approach a step further. together they introduced new measures to aid in the protection of the ecosystem at large - through the 'spatial management' approach to which andrew refers. this marked the start of restricted fishing areas in buffer zones around key penguin colonies in the antarctic peninsula and the south shetland islands during breeding season. keeping science honest""my science isn't because i am particularly for or against fishing - i have worked previously to help reduce seal bycatch in fisheries that refused to accept there was a bycatch problem. no, a significant motivator for me is i just don't particularly like the misuse of science, so i try to keep it as honest as it should, using data to tell the story and not being afraid to admit we don't know something if the data are not clear, rather than claim something when it is not supported. there is some quite emotive and inflammatory language used when discussing predator-fishery interactions, and most of it is not very helpful or based on science-based evidence. the amount of krill being removed is nominal compared to the amount consumed for example by whales, and with rebounding populations of humpback and fin whales over the past 30 years, i just don't see the data to support some of the claims being made regarding reducing the amount of krill available for them to feed on,"" he adds. it's all about the scientific evidence""we are going to go out there and keep on following predators such as fur seals, penguins and whales, and find out where these animals go, particularly when breeding season is finished and these animals are capable of moving more freely without offspring to feed. the logistics of getting around antarctica in areas away from national research infrastructure like stations and bases, makes getting these data from remote areas at times and in locations where the fishery operates almost impossible without active collaboration with the industry - one which they are positive to facilitate. a lot of the research on predator-fishery overlap and local krill abundance simply wouldn't happen without them. as well as working with partners in the fishery, we are also collaborating with tourism operators to establish marine predator monitoring programs, putting observers on ships to count whales and seals in fished and unfished areas during the spring, summer and autumn. doing this, we will get a clearer picture of the dynamics between marine predators and resource extracting activities like fishing. it's about collecting data to quantify what, if any, impact the fishery has and to help get a more data-driven picture about things people have assumed but haven't tested."" it is thanks to data like this that the krill fishery has a better overview of the ecosystem in which it operates, as well as a clearer indication of the areas that should be restricted due to the presence of predator populations. assumption is dangerous in antarctic marine ecosystem management, which is why, year after year, andrew and many other scientists pursues fresh data that is critical to maintaining and enhancing the sustainability of the krill fishery. his work is an important reminder that the sustainability of this fishery is a moving target that the industry must continuously work towards as the climate continues to change. ""the fact is that fisheries are an important source of protein for humans,"" he says, ""and so we must be nimble, by adapting our management strategies when new science-based information is available, and not destroy a resource on which so many depend. and i think in antarctica we can keep on trying to do things better and better, based on real data."" attachments disclaimer aker biomarine asapublished this content on03 october 2023and is solely responsible for the information contained therein. distributed bypublic, unedited and unaltered, on03 october 2023 14:02:16 utc.","andrew lowther of the norwegian polar institute spends part of each year living in a tent in antarctica.

"It’s unusual for a medication to become a household name; even more uncommon for its branding to become, like Advil, shorthand for an entire class of products; and rarest of all, for it to change not just U.S. medicine, but U.S. culture. Ozempichas done all three. Approved in 2017 as a type 2 diabetes medication, Ozempic has largely made its name—and a fortune for its manufacturer, Novo Nordisk—as a weight-loss aid. Novo Nordisk knew early on that diabetes patients often lost weight on the drug, but evencompany executives couldn’t have guessed how widely it would eventually take offas both an off-label anti-obesity treatment and avanity-driven status symbolfor those simply looking to shed a few pounds. Its runaway success mirrors that of similar medications, including Eli Lilly’s Mounjaro andWegovy, another Novo Nordisk product and the only one in the trio technically approved for weight loss. Prescriptions for all of them are flying off the pad at an eye-popping rate. Novo Nordisksold around $14 billionof its various diabetes and obesity drugs in the first half of 2023, and Eli Lillysold almost $1 billion worth of Mounjaro in a single quarterthis year. Prescriptions for these weight-loss meds are up 300% since early 2020, with more than 9 million written in the U.S. in the last three months of 2022 alone,according to health care industry research firm Trilliant Health. Demand is so great that Ozempic, Wegovy, and Mounjaro have all recently gone into shortage, and patients with type 2 diabetes havein some cases struggled to fill their prescriptionsas they compete for limited supplies with people looking to slim down; meanwhile, spas, internet suppliers, and compounding pharmacies are all fighting for their piece of the Ozempic pie. No one can quite agree on whether this frenzy is a good thing. Plenty of physicians (and, of course, the pharmaceutical executives who stand to get very, very rich) say it is, given that roughly three-quarters of U.S. adults qualify as either overweight or obese and are thus, according to leading public-health authorities, at risk of a range of serious health complications. “Obesity is an epidemic, and we urgently need effective treatments,” says Dr. Sahar Takkouche, an obesity and bariatric medicine specialist at Vanderbilt Health. But some doctors, researchers, and activists are uneasy about living in the age of Ozempic—one that has felt like a kind of deja vu, a return to an era when thinness and weight loss were unquestioningly valued. Before the Ozempic tsunami, a growing number of doctors and researchers had begun advocating for Health at Every Size, a research-backed set of principles from the Association for Size Diversity and Health that hold body size is not a measure of health or worth, and that all people deserve high-quality, non-stigmatizing medical care. Their efforts contributed to a burgeoning field known as “weight-neutral” medicine, which sees “weight” and “health” as separate, and worked in tandem with the wider body-positivity movement to help loosen the diet industry’s vice-like grip on American psyches. As the 2000s progressed, women’s magazines stopped pushing diets quite so hard. Clothing brands bragged about hiring models larger than a size 0. Even Weight Watchersrebranded as a “wellness” company called WW. Then Ozempic and its cohort came along, and it turned out lots of people still wanted to be skinny. Some industry watchers have even predicted that the rise of drugs like Ozempic—and an impending crop ofnew competitors that are potentially even more effective—could spell the end of obesity. But as these drugs transform both standard medical practice and cultural ideas about weight loss, a contentious debate is simmering beneath the surface: should we even be treating obesity? The U.S. medical establishment is clear about its stance on obesity: it is a “common, serious, and costly chronic disease,” as theU.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention puts it. By CDC estimates, more than 40% of U.S. adults and almost 20% of children and adolescents are obese, putting them at risk of health problems including heart disease, type 2 diabetes, stroke, and certain types of cancer. An additional 30% of adults are considered overweight, meaning less than a third of U.S. adults meet the CDC’s standard for a healthy body weight. If obesity is a disease, it follows logically that it should be treated. Historically, diet and exercise have been plan A for treating obesity. But in practice, lifestyle changes like these often aren’t enough. “Try as we might,a lot of exercise typically does not result in a significant amount of weight loss,” says Glenn Gaesser, a professor of exercise physiology at Arizona State University. That’s in part because people tend to get hungrier the more they move, offsetting whatever calories they burn at the gym, and in part because the body gets used to its size and works to stay at that set point, Gaesser explains. Lifestyle fixes can work for some people,studies show, but lots of people lose only modest amounts of weight or regain the pounds over time—a process known as “weight cycling” thatis itself linked to cardiovascular and metabolic health problems. For years, doctors had relatively few options to offer the many patients for whom diet and exercise didn’t work—things like the type 2 diabetes drug metformin, which can cause a modest amount of weight loss, and bariatric surgery, which works well but is unpopular among patients. And then came Ozempic and the rest. Ozempic, Wegovy, and Mounjaro all work by simultaneously slowing digestion and mimicking the appetite-suppressing hormone GLP-1 through a weekly injection. (Mounjaro also targets a second type of hormone receptor.) This double whammy means people need to eat far less food than usual, leading to an average15%to20%reduction in body weight after about a year.They don’t work well for everyone, but compared to older meds, “the efficacy of these drugs is remarkable,” Takkouche says. “The weight loss is undeniable.” And this class of drugs doesn’t just lower the readings on a scale.According to data from Novo Nordisk, semaglutide (the generic name for both Ozempic and Wegovy) slashes the risk for major cardiovascular events like heart attack and stroke by 20% among overweight or obese adults with heart disease. Justin, who asked to use only his first name to protect his privacy, saw “life-changing” results when he began taking Wegovy earlier this year. After struggling to lose weight through diet and exercise, the 29-year-old from North Carolina lost about 30 pounds in less than six months on the medication. As he followed instructions and scaled up his dosage over time, though, Justin started to experience side effects including acid reflux, nausea, diarrhea, and lethargy. (Research suggestsintestinal blockageand anelevated risk of thyroid tumorsare also potential side effects.) Eventually, Justin felt he had to choose between his health and his quality of life. As much as it pained him, quality of life won out. Since quitting Wegovy in June, Justin has gained back about half the weight he lost,a common outcome for patients who stop using GLP-1 drugs—which many do, either because of side effects or cost, since many insurance plans don’t cover weight-loss drugs andout-of-pocket prices can exceed $1,000 a month. Despite his mixed experience, Justin would still recommend that someone trying to lose weight consider Wegovy, and may someday go back on it himself at a lower dose. “It made enough of a difference, and it’s something I’ve been wanting for so long” that it’s tempting to go back, he says. Many obesity-medicine specialists share Justin’s feelings. “We have effective tools” for weight loss now, says Dr. Laura Davisson, director of medical weight management at West Virginia University Medicine. “Why not use them?” There is one big reason, according to a passionate group of doctors, researchers, and activists who believe in the principles of Health at Every Size. They feel obesity never should have been labeled a disease in the first place—and thus may not need to be treated at all. “Manipulating weight is not a path to health,” says Ragen Chastain, a certified patient advocate who co-authoreda library of Health at Every Size resources. “The belief that fewer fat people existing is good—that’s weight stigma.” As Chastain and others like her see it, Ozempic and its sister drugs are not life-saving anti-obesity medications, but new tools for reinforcing old, damaging body standards rooted in stigma, not science—all while raking in gobs of money for pharmaceutical companies. The idea that obesity is not a disease is still a controversial take in mainstream medicine. The CDC and American Medical Association (AMA) disagree with it, as do many physicians in the field. “‘Healthy at any size’—I don’t even like the connotation,” says Dr. Caroline Apovian, co-director of the Center for Weight Management and Wellness at Boston’s Brigham and Women’s Hospital. “Thereisunhealthy body weight.” And yet, the research on weight and health leaves room for questions. There are plenty of studies that show links between obesity and health problems ranging from fatty liver and sleep apnea to heart disease and cancer. But studies also suggest thatup to half of people with obesity are metabolically healthy, that people in that camp arenot at elevated risk for heart disease and death, and thatpeople who are overweight may in fact have a lower risk of premature deaththan people at “normal” weight. Studies have also found that, even though obesity is considered a risk factor for developing heart disease, overweight patients tend to fare better than thinner patients when they’re treated for related conditions, a finding often called the “obesity paradox.” Research also suggests weight loss has less of an impact on health thanphysical fitnessor thequality of one’s diet. “We’ve got this entire body of research based on a hypothesis that if you make fat people look like thin people they’ll have the same health outcomes,” Chastain says. But she’s not convinced that’s the case at all. For one thing, body mass index (BMI), the measure commonly used to diagnose overweight and obesity, is inherently flawed—a factacknowledged by influential organizations including the AMA. When the AMA designated obesity a disease in 2013, its own Council on Science and Public Healthurged against that decision. The council’s chief concern was the imprecision of BMI, which is a crude measure of total weight relative to height that, on its own, does not say much at all about someone’s health. It cannot, for example, distinguish between fat and muscle—which is why some athletes have BMIs that technically put them in the obese range. BMI’s path to ubiquity is convoluted. The formula—weight in kilograms divided by height in meters, squared—was developed in the 1830s byAdolphe Quetelet, a Belgian mathematician interested not in diagnosing obesity, but in defining the “average man,” an effort that mostly glossed over people other than white men. The resulting formula, known as the Quetelet Index, fit neatly into the burgeoning field of “race science,” a pseudoscientific effort to draw distinctions between people of different races thatfed into the eugenics movement, explains scholar Sabrina Strings, author ofFearing the Black Body: The Racial Origins of Fat Phobia. By the early 1900s, prominent U.S. eugenicists had latched onto the idea that fatness was a marker of moral failing associated with people of color. “We think that fatness is linked to disease,” Strings says, but “the history of fat stigma actually transits through race science and eugenics.” Later, in the 1960s,Black women were integral in starting fat-liberation movementsthat laid the groundwork for the modern body-positivity movement. These activists ran counter to the mainstream medical community, which was growing increasingly concerned about weight. In the 1970s, more than a century after the Quetelet Index was first developed, the prominent American physiologist Ancel Keys revived it. Keys felt insurance companies were using flawed methods of assessing weight-related health risks among people they covered. He proposed using the Quetelet Index (renamed as BMI) instead—even though, ina study he co-authored in 1972, Keys did not demonstrate that BMI consistently correlated with future heart disease risk. Today, experts widely agree that BMI is imperfect. And yet, it’s still used in research, to diagnose obesity, and to determine who is eligible for drugs like Wegovy. “We’re knowingly saying, ‘We don’t even know how to measure [excess fat], but we’re going to use the measure we have anyway and define two-thirds of the population as diseased,’” says Dr. Lisa Erlanger, a Seattle-based family-medicine physician who supports Health at Every Size. Erlanger believes that weight functions less as a measure of health than as a social determinant of health—in other words, a non-medical factor that nonetheless affects health through its impact on overall wellness. The weight stigma larger people encounter in doctor’s offices, the workplace, and social settings can all harm health, Erlanger says. And in the U.S.,adults with obesity are likely to be non-white and non-college-educated, two socioeconomic factors also linked to poorer health outcomes due to structural inequality. Erlanger feels so strongly that she has stripped weight from her medical practice wherever possible. Her office is designed to be comfortably navigated by people who are larger. The reading material in the waiting room doesn’t mention diets or weight loss. She doesn’t weigh patients at the beginning of their appointments. She never prescribes weight loss, and especially not weight-loss drugs. “I support anyone’s efforts to reduce their marginalization in society,” she says. But, at the same time, “I believe I have an ethical obligation not to offer a treatment with false promises.” It wasn’t weight loss that motivated Irene, who is 54 and lives in Washington State, to ask for a semaglutide prescription. Irene—who asked to use only her first name to preserve her privacy—has binge-eating disorder and often stayed up late into the night, snacking for hours after her husband and children had gone to bed. Irene read on social media that semaglutide had helped other people manage their binge-eating disorder, so it seemed worth a try. But it also felt something like self-betrayal. For most of her life, Irene was locked in a cycle of losing and regaining weight, obsessing about food and calories and constantly wishing her body looked different. Then, a few years ago, she learned about Health at Every Size and threw herself into the community with gusto. She sought out doctors who shared her perspective and joined a fat-liberation group—which made her deeply hesitant about using semaglutide, a drug infamous for helping already-skinny Hollywood starlets slim down. “It has been tricky to lose some weight and not get caught up in that as an aspiration going forward,” Irene says. “I deeply, deeply believe in [Heath at Every Size] and would love for the rest of the world to come around to it as well.” But now, she has to balance her support for the movement with the reality that, in an effort to manage her eating disorder, she has become one of the millions of people driving demand for anti-obesity medications to new heights. Pharmaceutical companies seem perfectly happy to meet that demand. Some industry watchers have predicted thatMounjaro will become one of the highest-selling drugs of all time, sending maker Eli Lilly’sshare prices soaring by about 25%. Meanwhile, Ozempic and Wegovy helped Novo Nordisk reacha nearly $442 billion market capitalizationas of late October—higher than the gross domestic product of its entire home country, Denmark. It’s no surprise, then, that an army of new weight-loss medications are marching toward regulatory approval, some with results even more impressive than their predecessors.Data from Eli Lillysuggest an anti-obesity drug it is developing can help people lose about a quarter of their body weight in less than two years. The pharma giant is, along with other companies, also exploringoral GLP-1 drugs, which would have an even lower barrier to entry than their injectable formulas. (Novo Nordisk’s Rybelsus is already available as a pill.) With so many options currently or soon to be available, it’s not so far-fetched to imagine a world when all anyone needs to lose weight is a prescription. Davisson, the obesity specialist from West Virginia, says about 80% of her patients are already on some form of weight-loss drug. She feels anyone who is overweight or obese should consider some form of treatment, since they may develop complications over time even if they’re healthy at the moment. “Everyone is metabolically healthy,” she says, “until they’re not.” But other physicians are struggling with their place in this new world. When Dr. Mara Gordon, a family physician in New Jersey, finished her medical training almost a decade ago, she didn’t question the idea that weight loss was a good thing. But the longer she practiced—and saw how her patients shut down when she urged them to drop a few pounds—and the more studies she read, the more she began to doubt whether weight loss should be an assumed goal. “I found, increasingly, that it was all downside,” she says. Gordon minimized weight’s role in her practice, focusing instead on other markers of health—things like insulin resistance (which can predict diabetes risk), blood pressure, chronic pain, mental health, and quality of life. Today, though, more and more patients come into her office asking for Ozempic and Wegovy by name. Often, she says, patients who want to drop pounds are technically overweight but have little medical reason for taking a GLP-1 drug: normal cholesterol, good blood pressure, no diabetes or warning signs for it. On a purely medical basis, Gordon feels there’s no need to take out her prescription pad. But when she looks at the whole picture, the decision becomes more complex. Her patients’ test results may not signal a problem, but they’re still desperate to lose weight—maybe so they have the energy and mobility to play with their kids, or to improve their body image, or simply fit into a world that prizes thinness. In those moments, Gordon has to set aside her personal feelings about Ozempic, and about weight loss writ large. “If you’re facing hatred and fatphobia on a daily basis, if you can’t do the things you need to do because the chair at your office isn’t the correct size,” Ozempic may truly help, Gordon says. “I wish we lived in a less superficial society. But my job is to take care of the patient right in front of me.” She often writes the prescription in the end.",Ozempic has largely made its name as a weight-loss aid.

Emmy-winning ESPN Films and NFL Films producer and filmmaker Kenan Kamwana Holley will direct. Founded in Chicago in 1926, the Harlem Globetrotters were the first all-Black American basketball team that showcased and captured the spirit and talent of Black athletes at a time when they were not eligible to play professional team basketball. The doc will shine a light, via talking heads and archive material, on the players’ inspirational story of overcoming adversity, leading equity for people of color, and breaking barriers for women players. Among players to have played for the team over the decades are Wilt Chamberlain, Lynette Woodard, “Wee” Willie Gardner, Marques Haynes, Fred “Curly” Neal and “Sweet Lou” Dunbar.Related StoriesNewsHarlem Globetrotters Appoints Longtime Nickelodeon Exec As Head Of Global ContentNewsJohn Madden Series Huddle; Tom Brady Calling The Signals With Gavin O'Connor, Todd Lieberman, Gotham Chopra On Biopic Of Man Who Was Soundtrack Of The Life Of Any Football Fan The project will be produced by Oscar and Emmy-winning producer Lieberman (The Fighter,The Proposal), Former NBA coach and basketball Hall of Fame member George Karl of Truth+ Media, Kenan Kamwana Holley (Snoop and Son) of Holley Films as well as President of the Harlem Globetrotters & Herschend Entertainment Studios, Keith Dawkins, and Bronwen O’Keefe. Lieberman, Karl and Holley recently worked together on the upcoming Amazon documentary series on the rise and fall of the American Basketball Association (ABA). “No other American sports team has captured the hearts and minds of millions of people around the world like the Harlem Globetrotters,” said Dawkins. “The Globetrotters are world-class entertainers, consummate professionals, global ambassadors of goodwill, and the hallmark of basketball innovation! All of this has kept them relevant for almost 100 years. We are excited to tell this enduring and powerful story through our partnership with Hidden Pictures.” “The Globetrotters stand as an iconic American brand recognized the world over. For me, they are a joyous childhood memory of a thrilling Saturday afternoon spent with my dad. As a boy I was intrigued by their mastery and magic, as millions around the world continue to be today,” added Holley. “When I look behind the curtain of the Globetrotter’s story, I find a century of world-class athletes turned into world-class entertainers, sometimes organically and sometimes begrudgingly. But always with an intent to keep us smiling, even as the world outside of the arena rings with both joy and pain.” “The team is honored to bring the iconic history of the Harlem Globetrotters to fans everywhere,” commented Lieberman. “For almost 100 years their unique basketball style has mesmerized audiences around the world and we now get to celebrate and recognize the journey it took to get here.” “I love the Globetrotters and my kids have gone to over 20 games of theirs! They bring joy and laughter to the game of basketball. Their history is a big part of the soul of the game,” said Karl. “The celebration of 100 years playing hoops, before millions of fans around the world, is a moment that needs to be recognized. In many ways, they have opened up the game I love to greater visibility and integration. Here’s to another 100 years — keep serving and loving the game, Globetrotters!” The Harlem Globetrotters will begin their 2024 World Tour next month and will embark on their international tour in spring 2024.

"a scholastic book fair banner pictured outside a school in queens, new york.lindsey nicholson/ucg/universal images group via getty imageshide caption a scholastic book fair banner pictured outside a school in queens, new york. it's fall, which means it's scholastic book fair season. schools across the country are setting up shelves in their libraries and gymnasiums to let students shop a vast selection of books provided by the educational and publishing company. it's a highlight for many students, and a nostalgic memory for many adults. but the events have also waded into controversy, after the company behind them changed its policy to help schools navigate the growing number of book bans in the u.s. — and was quickly accused of caving to censorship. the accusations started swirlingon tiktokandredditlast month: scholastic — the billion-dollar educational company that both publishes and distributes books — was allowing schools to opt out of providing diverse books at its nationwide book fairs, according to complaints by several school librarians. they said scholastic was putting most of the books focused on race and sexuality into a separate display and letting schools decide whether to order it. backlash was swift. scores of writers and educators on social media accused the company of helping to enable book restrictions, and argued that the company was not taking a strong enough stand against them. scholastic acknowledged the changein a statementon friday, but defended its decision. enacted or pending legislation in more than 30 states prohibits certain kinds of books — mostly ""lgbtqia+ titles and books that engage with the presence of racism in our country"" — from being in schools, the company said. because book fairs take place in schools and without parental supervision, it said, such laws create ""an almost impossible dilemma: back away from these titles or risk making teachers, librarians, and volunteers vulnerable to being fired, sued, or prosecuted."" the company said in order to continue offering diverse books, it created a new collection for its elementary school fairs called ""share every story, celebrate every voice."" ""we don't pretend this solution is perfect — but the other option would be to not offer these books at all — which is not something we'd consider,"" scholastic said, adding that there are still diverse titles at all of its book fairs and that middle school fairs remain unchanged. a scholastic spokesperson told npr that the company has been in touch with customers about the new policy since august. they said many school districts had questions and concerns about how to navigate the new legislation, which in some cases took effect over the summer. those conversations, they added, weren't about how to eliminate certain books from their fairs, but how to safely hold a fair in the current climate. according to a list shared with npr, out of the more than 100 titles in this year's book fair, most of the books dealing with issues of race, gender and sexuality are in the ""share every story, celebrate every voice"" collection. the case includes some 30 books, ranging fromthe abcs of black historyto biographies of rep. john lewis, ruby bridges and supreme court justice ketanji brown jackson. there are picture books and graphic novels by poet amanda gorman, civil rights activist and football playercolin kaepernick, and jojo siwa, a dancer and internet personality whocame out as gayin 2021. a book based on the pbs animated showalma's wayfeatures a puerto rican family hunting for a kid's missing tooth. the scholastic spokesperson says moving those titles to a specific group made space to include more diverse books in their other collections and that the change has been largely well-received by school districts. the movement to restrict books is ""driven by a vocal minority demanding censorship,"" says the free speech grouppen america, which said it found 3,362 cases of book bans in the 2022-'23 school year, up from 2,532 bans in the 2021-'22 school year. the group defines a ban as any move that restricts access to a book. a majority ofamericans opposebook restrictions, according to an npr/ipsos poll. it says such bans in schools and libraries are most prevalent in texas, florida, missouri, utah and south carolina, but are being ""modeled and replicated across the country."" many districts are still figuring out what new book bans mean for their classrooms and libraries. the wording of the laws themselves — and the resulting legal back and forth — have created a lot of confusion,as is the case in texaswhere one of those new laws temporarily takes effect this month after an appeals court blocked a judge's injunction against it. a fifth-gradeteacher in georgia was firedearlier this year for reading out loud from a book addressing gender stereotypes,which she saidwas chosen from the scholastic book fair. (sheappealed her terminationto the state board of education last month.) a middle school teacher in texas was fired for assigning her class an illustrated adaptation ofanne frank's diary. other librarians and educators across the country have faced harassment, threats and termination in the face of book bans, anti-critical race theory protests and otherculture war issues. some have started tocensor themselves, whileothers have resignedaltogether. mychal threets, a librarian in california with a large social media following, responded to the scholastic changeon tiktok. addressing the company, he said: ""we are fighting for the freedom to read. we are celebrating the freedom to read. join us. you are the powerhouse. use your voice.""","Schools across the country are setting up shelves in their libraries and gymnasiums to let students shop a vast selection of books provided by the educational and publishing company.

In fact it's taken on the appearance of something of a moral panic in recent time. What is slightly puzzling to me is that people are getting angry with the banks when the banks are responding rationally to the economic incentives set for them by their regulators. If people want to get angry about this stuff, they should be getting angry with the government and the Financial Action Task Force and the various people responsible for the regulations. Suspicious Activities We’ve all heard stories about friends or colleagues finding them, or their kids’ sports club or their elderly parents or their cousin’s small business, getting a letter from the bank saying “sorry, your account is being closed, there’s no point calling us because we can’t tell you why”. These are stories about what banks refer to as “exiting” or “de-risking” and, as an interesting piece in the New York Times",There has been much comment in the media about the issue of banks either denying accounts to people or closing the accounts of existing customers.

What is slightly puzzling to me is that people are getting angry with the banks when the banks are responding rationally to the economic incentives set for them by their regulators.

"iStock MUMBAI - Indian  government bonds  could see foreign inflows of close to $25 billion if they get included in key  Bloomberg bond indexes , a treasury official with  DBS Bank  India said.  The India 10-year bond yield could move lower by about 7 bps in case of any news of inclusion in the Bloomberg Index, with inflows of around $25 billion, said  Sameer Karyatt , executive director - treasury and markets at DBS Bank India.  But bond yields may not rise if the inclusion is deferred as the market has not rallied in anticipation, Karyatt added.  Bond traders are eyeing a decision on the inclusion of  Indian bonds  in the Bloomberg Global Aggregate and the Emerging Market Local Currency indexes, and expect an announcement by the end of this month.  In September, JPMorgan announced the inclusion of India in its widely tracked emerging market debt index from June 2024. Market participants have pegged inflows in Indian bonds in the range of $20 billion to $25 billion over the next year.  Bonds under the fully accessible route, with no upper cap on foreign investments, saw more than 165 billion rupees ($2 billion) of inflows since JPMorgan's announcement, data from Clearing Corp of India showed.  This has helped keep yields in check.  A drop in U.S. yields as well as a retreat in oil prices from their recent highs has also aided a fall in domestic yields, said Karyatt.  Indian benchmark 7.18% 2033 bond yield was trading around 7.25% on Tuesday, down 15 bps from a high of 7.40% hit last month.  The latest softer-than-expected inflation data in the world's largest economy has boosted bets that the U.S. Federal Reserve is done with rate hikes and could begin cutting rates in the first half of 2024.  Data showing core inflation in India has moved towards 4.5% and expectations that any debt sale from the central bank is unlikely immediately has also helped market sentiment.

"An elephant christened by activists as one of the world's ""saddest"" has died at a Philippine zoo, where she lived almost all her life alone in a pen. Tributes have poured in for Mali, who was the star attraction at Manila Zoo for four decades and much beloved. But the lonely plight of the country's only elephant was a long-running concern for animal rights activists.  One of them was Sir Paul McCartney, who asked authorities to transfer Mali to an elephant sanctuary. Mali's death on Tuesday was announced in a Facebook video by Manila mayor Honey Lacuna, who said visits to the zoo to see Mali were among her happiest childhood memories. Last Friday, the Asian elephant was seen constantly rubbing her trunk against a wall, which indicated that she was in pain, the zoo's chief veterinarian Dr Heinrich Patrick Peña-Domingo said. By early Tuesday, Mali was lying on her side and breathing heavily. Veterinarians administered antihistamines and vitamins but she died later that afternoon. An autopsy found that she had cancer in some of her organs, as well as a blockage in her aorta. Mali, whose full name is Vishwa Ma'ali, was gifted to former Philippine first lady Imelda Marcos by the Sri Lankan government in 1981, when she was 11 months old.Manila Zoo was also home to another elephant, Shiva, who arrived in 1977 and died in 1990. Mali had been the zoo's only elephant since then. At the height of the pandemic, the Manila Zoo also served as a vaccination site for children, where Mali kept them entertained. Animal rights activists criticised the decrepit conditions at Manila Zoo and said its keepers were ill-equipped to provide Mali with proper medical care. Zoo authorities however argued that the elephant was best kept in captivity as she had not known what life was like in the wild. In a letter to then President Benigno Aquino III in 2012, Sir Paul described footage he saw of Mali in captivity as ""heartbreaking"". ""I am writing to add my voice to the many others who are supporting the transfer of Mali, the lonely elephant currently being held at the Manila Zoo, to a sanctuary in Thailand as soon as possible,"" he said. Former Smiths frontman Morrissey made a similar written appeal, but Mali remained at Manila Zoo. ""One of the world's saddest elephants has passed away,"" People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (Peta) said. ""Rest in peace, Mali, you deserve so much more."" On X, formerly Twitter, different generations of Filipinos recalled how school field trips in Manila would always include a visit to Mali, and lamented the fact that she died alone. One user recalled her first sight of Mali 11 years ago. ""Seeing Mali walking around, you will feel how lonely this elephant is. It broke my heart... and now it was announced that Mali has died."" ""Sad about Mali, the famous elephant here in the Philippines passing away. Hoping no more elephants will be confined to zoos,"" another X user wrote. At a press conference on Wednesday, the Manila mayor told reporters that she would ask the Sri Lankan government to donate another elephant to the Philippine capital. She said Mali's long-time caretakers had been crying over her death, and added that Mali's transfer to a sanctuary was ""never considered"", given the length of her captivity. ""She might seem alone, but she had us beside her,"" Ms Lacuna said in Tagalog, her voice cracking. ""She was the face that greeted everyone who visited Manila Zoo. She is a part of our lives.""","Mali was the star attraction at Manila Zoo for four decades and much beloved.

"Reuters The leader of  Hamas  said on Tuesday that a truce agreement with Israel was close, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he hoped for good news soon about hostages, the most optimistic signals so far of a deal to pause fighting and free captives. Hamas officials were ""close to reaching a truce agreement"" with Israel and the group has delivered its response to Qatari mediators, Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh said in a statement sent to Reuters by his aide. Netanyahu said: ""We are making progress. I don't think it's worth saying too much, not at even this moment, but I hope there will be good news soon"", according to remarks released by the Israeli prime minister's office. Netanyahu would convene his war cabinet from 1600 GMT ""in light of developments in the matter of the release of our hostages"", his office said, followed by meetings of his wider security cabinet and the full cabinet. A source briefed on the negotiations told Reuters the long-awaited agreement, which would see the first truce of the war and the first mass release of those held by both sides, was in its ""final stages"" and ""closer than it has ever been"". That was echoed by a U.S. official who said it was the ""closest we've been"" to a hostage deal. The deal, as described by the first source, envisages the release of around 50 civilian hostages by Hamas and of female and minor-aged  Palestinian  detainees from Israeli custody, as well as a multi-day pause in fighting. A Hamas official told Al Jazeera TV that negotiations were centred on how long the truce would last, arrangements for delivery of aid into Gaza and details of the exchange of captives. Both sides would free women and children, and details would be announced by Qatar, which is mediating in the negotiations, said the official,  Issat el Reshiq . Israel's Channel 12 and Channel 13 TV stations both quoted unidentified officials as saying terms of a deal could be reached ""within hours"". Hamas took about 240 hostages during its Oct. 7 rampage into Israel that killed 1,200 people, according to Israeli tallies. Mirjana Spoljaric, president of the  International Committee of the Red Cross  (ICRC), met Haniyeh in Qatar on Monday to ""advance humanitarian issues"" related to the conflict, the Geneva-based ICRC said in a statement. She also separately met Qatari authorities. The ICRC said it was not part of negotiations aimed at releasing the hostages, but as a neutral intermediary it was ready ""to facilitate any future release that the parties agree to"". RAIN AND COLD WORSEN CONDITIONS Talk of an imminent hostage deal has swirled for days. Israeli Ambassador to the United States Michael Herzog said on ABC's ""This Week"" on Sunday that he hoped for an agreement ""in the coming days"", while Qatar's Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed Bin Abdulrahman al-Thani said that the remaining sticking points were ""very minor"". U.S. President Joe Biden and other U.S. officials said on Monday a deal was near. The Hamas raid on Oct. 7, the deadliest day in Israel's 75-year-old history, prompted Israel to invade Gaza to annihilate the militant group that has ruled there since 2007. Since then, Gaza's Hamas-run government says at least 13,300 Palestinians have been confirmed killed, including at least 5,600 children, by Israeli bombardment that has turned much of Gaza, especially its northern half, into wasteland. Around two-thirds of Gaza's 2.3 million people have been made homeless, with thousands a day still trekking south on foot with belongings and children in their arms. The central and southern parts of the enclave, where Israel has told them to go, have also regularly come under attack. A day and a night of rain and cold winter weather worsened the dire conditions in Gaza for the displaced, many thousands of whom are sleeping rough or in makeshift tents. 20 REPORTED DEAD IN NUSEIRAT STRIKE Gaza health authorities said on Tuesday at least 20 Palestinians were killed in Israeli bombing of the Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza at midnight. There was no immediate comment from Israel. The already crowded Nuseirat district, which grew out of a camp for Palestinian refugees from the 1948 Israeli-Arab war, is just south of the wetlands that bisect the strip and has been the arrival point for huge numbers escaping the fighting further north. Bombing in southern areas leaves Gazans fearing they have no place safe to go. Neighbouring Egypt has allowed the evacuation of some wounded and foreign passport holders, but says it will not accept a mass exodus. ""Continued bombing targeting displaced people in the South has a clear objective, and that is to force Gaza's residents to leave the Strip,"" Egypt's foreign ministry spokesman said on X. ""Egypt has clearly declared its utter rejection of any enforced displacement attempt of Palestinians."" Tens of thousands of civilians are believed to remain in the north despite an Israeli order to flee. All hospitals there have ceased functioning normally, many still housing patients and displaced Gazans. Israel says Hamas uses hospitals as shields for its fighters, which Hamas and the hospitals deny. The World Health Organization said it was working on plans to evacuate three Northern Gaza hospitals: Al Shifa, Al Ahli and the Indonesian Hospital, lamenting this as a last resort. ""It's robbing the entire population of the north of the means to seek health (care),"" WHO spokesperson Christian Lindmeier told a Geneva press briefing. Issam Nabhan, head of the nursing department of the Indonesian Hospital, where the WHO and Gaza authorities say 12 people were killed on Monday by Israeli fire, told Al-Jazeera on Tuesday there were 60 dead bodies on the grounds. ""There is no oxygen to supply the patients. All those on artificial respiration have died. We speak out to the free world. The Indonesian hospital has become a cemetery, not a hospital.""

"iwaki, japan --local fishing communities feared the worst when the wrecked fukushima nuclear power plant began discharging treated radioactive wastewater into the sea. instead of a business calamity, however, consumers from across the nation have supported the region by eating more fish. besides boosting a fragile industry, the demand has helped mitigate the impact ofchina's ban onjapanese seafood, though there are worries about the future of the water release. “so far, i haven’t heard anyone raising safety concerns over the treated water release. i'd say zero,” kazuto harada, who works at marufuto fish store near the onahama port in fukushima, said as he stood by a tank of lobsters caught nearby. “i'm half surprised, and half relieved."" customers nationwide are placing orders, with many asking for “joban-mono,"" or fish from the waters off fukushima and its southern neighbor ibaraki. that includes regional favorites flounder and greeneye. by late afternoon, almost all the fresh local catch sells out. sumie nouchi, a tokyo resident, visited the lalamew seafood market after playing golf in the area with friends. “i was determined to come here and buy fish on my way home,” she said. her purchases included rosy seabass, greeneye, squid and octopus. it's less about supporting local businesses than because joban-mono tastes good, she says. “i'm not worried about the treated water discharge. i've been checking sampling results and i trust them.” the fukushima daiichi nuclear power plant started releasing treated and diluted radioactive wastewater into the sea on aug. 24. officials said it was necessary because more than 1.3 million tons of radioactive wastewater has accumulated in about 1,000 tanks at the plant since its cooling system was destroyed by a massive earthquake and tsunami in 2011. even with the wastewater release, the tanks are estimated to reach capacity in the first half of 2024, and space at the plant will be needed for its decommissioning, which will take decades — if it’s ever accomplished. before being released, the water is treated to reduce radioactive materials to safe levels. it's then diluted with massive amounts of seawater to make it much safer than international standards. the release, which is expected to continue for decades, was strongly opposed by fishing groups and neighboring countries, including south korea, where hundreds have protested. beijing immediately banned all imports of japanese seafood. it was a major hit to japanese seafood producers, processors and exporters — especially those in northern japan who specialize in scallops and sea cucumbers, which are coveted in china. china’s seafood ban and reports of its impact on the japanese fishing industry may have tempered japanese criticism of the water release and encouraged people to eat more seafood from the region. “before the discharge began, we were worried that consumers may stay away from fukushima fish, but we saw a significant increase of our customers asking for fukushima fish,” said futoshi kinoshita, executive of foodison, which operates the sakana bacca chain. “after china's ban on japanese seafood, we are seeing more customers buying not only fukushima fish but also japanese seafood in general to support the industry."" he says fish testing data are key to making consumers confident in the seafood's safety, but the data alone is not enough. “i believe people who are still concerned about fukushima fish may develop confidence by seeing their friends or relatives eating it without worry, and i hope the circle of confidence will expand.” the international atomic energy agency concluded in a july report that the discharge, if carried out exactly as planned, would cause negligible impact on the environment and human health. the iaea safety and sampling missions that visited fukushima after the discharge began said it was going well so far. the release of a third batch of water began thursday, and tokyo electric power company, the fukushima plant operator, said everything is moving as planned. japan’s government has set up a relief fund to help find new markets and reduce the pain of china’s seafood ban. measures include the temporary purchase, freezing and storage of seafood and the promotion of seafood sales at home. cabinet ministers have traveled to fukushima to sample local seafood and promote its safety, and the united states embassy in tokyo has been helping find new markets, including its military bases in japan. despite the wastewater discharges, auction prices at fukushima fish markets have remained stable — or even occasionally higher than normal. but katsuya goto, a fukushima prefectural fisheries official, said that the situation is still fragile. “any mishap in the seawater discharges and its sampling results would easily hurt the reputation of the fish, so we have to carefully watch and make sure everything is as planned,” goto said. “the government and tepco have begun this despite local fishers' opposition, so we must watch and make sure they do it right.” more than two months after the discharge began, the support movement is still growing. while individual consumers favor ordering fish by mail and shopping at seafood markets, prefectural government cafeterias have started serving fukushima seafood for lunch. the tokyo metropolitan government started an “eat and cheer"" subsidy campaign in late october, joined by 1,000 seafood retailers through the end of december. the campaign targets customers interested in high-priced seafood like lobsters. in kyoto, a group of world-renowned japanese “kaiseki” cuisine chefs, will develop menus that primarily use fukushima fish starting early next year. yoshinori tanaka at toriyone, a kyoto restaurant, and a member of the japanese culinary academy, said dozens of chefs plan to hold tasting events around the country beginning in the spring, and eventually serve their menus at hundreds of restaurants. “home-grown farm and fisheries products are indispensable for japanese cuisine,” tanaka said. “of course the safety of the treated water release is a prerequisite to fight off the negative reputation. we are hoping our project can also contribute to addressing safety concerns that some people still have.” some experts warn that efforts to boost fukushima fish won't last forever and the region needs to have long-term measures to revive the fisheries industry in the region while making sure to avoid any safety lapses. fukushima’s fisheries community, tourism and the economy were badly hit and are still recovering. local fishing was beginning to return to normal in 2021 when the government announced the water release plan. fukushima’s local catch today is still about one-fifth of its pre-disaster levels due to a decline in the fishing population and smaller catch sizes. hiroharu haga, the manager of ichiyoshi, a fish store at the lalamew seafood market in onahama, said customers increased after the treated water discharge, with many ordering from outside of fukushima, but he cannot meet all the requests because of a limited supply. “i wish i could sell more local fish,” haga said. ___ find more ap asia-pacific coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/asia-pacific","Local fishing communities feared the worst when the wrecked fukushima nuclear power plant began

"the scale and potential implications of the new escalation between israel and gaza-based palestinian militant group hamas should not be“exaggerated,”polish president andrzej duda believes. the president made the remarks on sunday as he spoke with broadcaster polsat. asked whether the ongoing escalation in the middle east might lead to a new world war, duda said it was an unlikely scenario. “i would not exaggerate. this is not the first war there in the middle east. let us remember that such situations have already occurred in recent decades. there were wars fought there that did not lead to any world war. so, i wouldn’t go that far,”duda stated. at the same time, the president admitted that the scale of the escalation has already surpassed the most recent flare-ups, stating that it was“indeed a situation that has not been seen there for a long time and is very dangerous.” the polish president also claimed the conflict between israel and hamas actually plays into the hands of russia since it diverts attention from the ukrainian conflict.“this certainly helps russia and russian aggression against ukraine; it distracts the world’s attention,”duda asserted. however, when asked whether he’d shared his take with his israeli counterpart isaac herzog during a phone call earlier in the day, duda said it was not the case and alleged potential involvement of any third parties in the hostilities was not discussed. “no. we didn’t talk about that. it wasn’t a long conversation. first of all, i expressed our condolences and sympathies to the israeli people and also to the president himself,”duda stated. the escalation between israel and hamas began early on saturday, when the militant group launched a surprise attack on southern israel from gaza. the militants overran multiple military installations along the border, breaking through into israeli territory. multiple israeli soldiers and civilians were killed or kidnapped during the attack, with more than 600 already confirmed dead, according to figures by zaka, a volunteer group that handles human remains after terrorist attacks in israel. israel responded with airstrikes on gaza, redeploying troops towards the southern border. it also announced a call-up of military reservists and formally entered a state of war on sunday.","Polish president andrzej duda believes the escalation in the middle east should not be “exaggerated’ “Such situations have already occurred in recent decades, there were wars fought there that did not lead to any world war. so, i wouldn’t go that far,” duda said in an interview with broadcaster polsat.","On 22 March 2023, Polish president andrzej duda believes the escalation in the middle east should not be “exaggerated’ “Such situations have already occurred in recent decades, there were wars fought there that did not lead to any world war. so, i wouldn’t go that far,” duda said in an interview with broadcaster polsat.",,Politics,-0.0036879422910073,-0.0048007436377234,-0.0462517150934191,True
"In 2008,Steve Jobs claimedthat Apple had explored adding some sort of 3G connectivity to its MacBooks, but abandoned the plans because the required chips would take up too much space inside the laptop’s case. If Apple can integrate a wireless modem into its Apple silicon chips by 2028, however, that problem could be fixed — 20 years after Jobs admitted defeat. In the future, your MacBook could come with wireless connectivity, allowing you to access the internet even without a Wi-Fi link. That would be perfect for any time you head out onto the road with your MacBook and struggle to connect to the internet, and would bring it on par with the iPhone andApple Watch. How do we know this? Well, it’s the latest claim from reporter Mark Gurman’sPower On newsletter, and the journalist claims this won’t be any old wireless chip — it will be an in-house component built directly into the Apple silicon chip that powers all thebest MacBooksof the future. Unfortunately, it’s not likely to see the light of day until 2028 at the earliest, meaning you’ll have to stick to tethering your iPhone as a mobile hotspot for now. Gurman notes that the wireless chip will potentially be ready by 2026, but that Apple will need two to three years to fit it inside its devices. Still, if your MacBook does belatedly get 5G connectivity (or something even faster), it could be a brilliant move for Apple fans, especially if you head off into the wilds with your laptop and need solid internet coverage. Apple has been trying to design more of the parts in its devices for a long time now — after all, that control is what led to the company ditching Intel chips in favor of Apple silicon a few years ago. In the case of the wireless chip, there’s a very clear reason why it makes sense. Sure, you can get 5G on your MacBook right now if youtether your iPhone to it, and that works well for a lot of people. But it’s an imperfect solution. What if you forget your iPhone, or you wander out of range with your phone while your MacBook is downloading something? Building wireless connectivity into the Mac itself avoids all that. Plus, it gives Apple even more control over its ecosystem and lessens its reliance on third-party manufacturers, something the company has evidently been keen to do for years. Whatever the motivation, though, the upshot will be the same: a better experience on your Mac when you’re away from the Wi-Fi router. And I’m all for that.","In 2008,Steve Jobs claimedthat Apple had explored adding some sort of 3G connectivity to its MacBooks.

"Republican support for Israel has been near monolithic since the 7 October attack by Hamas.  Conservatives argue the US is backing a close ally, standing up for the region's only democracy and sending a message that terror against civilians will not be tolerated. But there's more to it than that. Evangelical conservatives are a key part of the Republican party's coalition, and these religious voters - and politicians - have a connection to the state of Israel that runs deep. George Washington University religious scholar Christopher Rollston says: ""There's a strong sense within evangelicalism that the Jewish people are God's people.  ""And there's a theological assumption that's pretty pervasive within certain segments of evangelicalism that the establishment of the modern state of Israel was the fulfilment of biblical prophecy."" The new Republican Speaker of the US House of Representatives, Mike Johnson, has strong evangelical ties. The Louisiana congressman was one of a handful of politicians who addressed a crowd organisers estimated as being in the hundreds of thousands at a ""March for Israel"" event in Washington DC on Tuesday.  Quoting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, he called the conflict between Israel and Hamas ""a fight between good and evil, between light and darkness, between civilisation and barbarism"". He said demands for an Israeli ceasefire in Gaza were ""outrageous"". ""It is my hope that this gathering today serves as a reminder to the entire world, but also to those within our own borders, that the United States stands proudly with Israel and the Jewish people forever,"" he said. Mr Johnson stood on a stage bedecked with dozens of Israeli and American flags, the US Capitol in the background. Two senior Democrats, Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer and House minority leader Hakeem Jeffries, joined him, along with Republican Senator Joni Ernst. They raised their hands together and led the audience in a chant of ""we stand with Israel"". ""There are few issues in Washington that could so easily bring together leaders of both parties in both chambers,"" Mr Johnson said, ""but the survival of the state of Israel unites us together and unites all Americans."" The Democrats are divided, however. While the two congressional leaders, along with President Joe Biden, have been firm in their support for Israel following the attack, a growing number on the left are calling attention to Palestinian civilian casualties and condemning the Israeli military campaign. With the exception of a handful of Republican politicians, however, dissent on the right has been missing. When a standalone bill providing $14.3bn (£11.5bn) in US aid to Israel was introduced in the House of Representatives, only two Republicans - Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Thomas Massie of Kentucky - voted no. Their isolated opposition is a far cry from the significant and growing number of Republicans who oppose continued US support for Ukraine, the world's other current major international conflict.  The influence of an evangelical leader invited to speak towards the end of the March for Israel's programme helps explain why Israel is treated differently by Republicans.  John Hagee is a Texas-based Christian minister and president of Christians United for Israel, which boasts 10 million members. In 2008, he said the Holocaust was part of God's plan to return Jews to Israel. The Republican presidential candidate at the time, John McCain, declined his endorsement in part because of those comments. The organisers of Tuesday's march, the Jewish Federations of North America and the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations, invited Mr Hagee to speak at their rally, however, as a part of a ""voices of allies"" segment. The organisers did not immediately respond to BBC requests for comment. For his part, Mr Hagee was effusive in his support for Israel. He told the crowd that a line should be drawn uniting Christians and Jews and that there was no ""middle"" ground in the conflict between Israel and Hamas. ""We must all stand united with one voice and boldly declare over and over: Israel, you are not alone,"" he said. In his deep southern preacher drawl, he placed the fate of Israel squarely in a religious context. ""The God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob guarantees Israel's deliverance will come as proclaimed every year during Passover,"" he said. ""Israel is the apple of God's eye. Israel is the shining city on the hill. God says of Israel, Israel is my firstborn son."" For some evangelicals, however, the ties between their religion and the fate of Israel have a darker hue. And it's where Mr Hagee's more controversial views come into play.  In the End Days, a certain strain of Christian theology holds, the Jewish people will either convert to Christianity or perish in flames. It is a key step towards Armageddon that is then followed by 1,000 years of peace, according to this belief. A Pew Research survey last year found 39% of Americans - including 63% of evangelicals - believe humanity is ""living in the end times"". And for the moment - on the stage in Washington on Tuesday and in the halls of Congress - the interests of Israel, Republicans and evangelicals are in alignment.","Republican support for Israel has been near monolithic since the 7 October attack by Hamas.

"Audio created using Google DeepMind’s AI Lyria model, such as tracks made with YouTube’s new audio generation features , will be watermarked with SynthID to let people identify their AI-generated origins after the fact. In a blog post , DeepMind said the watermark shouldn’t be detectable by the human ear and “doesn’t compromise the listening experience,” and added that it should still be detectable even if an audio track is compressed, sped up or down, or has extra noise added. Watermarking tools like SynthID are seen as an important safeguard against some of the harms of generative AI. President Joe Biden’s executive order on artificial intelligence , for example, calls for a new set of government-led standards for watermarking AI-generated content. It’s a promising area, but current technologies are far from a silver bullet to defend against fakes. According to DeepMind, SynthID’s audio implementation works by “converting the audio wave into a two-dimensional visualization that shows how the spectrum of frequencies in a sound evolves over time.” It claims the approach is “unlike anything that exists today.” The news that Google is embedding the watermarking feature into AI-generated audio comes just a few short months after the company released SynthID in beta for images created by Imagen on Google Cloud’s Vertex AI. The watermark is resistant to editing like cropping or resizing, although DeepMind cautioned that it’s not foolproof against “ extreme image manipulations. ” Comments","DeepMind says the watermark shouldn’t be detectable by the human ear.

""As both cities faced challenges to the status quo from the rising middle classes, subversive impulses gave rise to vibrant cultures of theatregoing, pleasure seeking, and new forms of visual art.""  It's a real treat to get to see up close the amazingly precise and exquisitely small Japanese woodcuts—and have them right next to the GIANT lithographed posters advertising Parisian shows and entertainers (you've seen book-sized Toulouse-Lautrec images before but they are extra-amazing when they fill a wall!)

Bhaichung, who was serving as the working president of the Hamro  Sikkim  Party, has served as the face of the party since 2018, unsuccessfully contesting the 2019 elections. In September of this year,  football  legend and politician Bhaichung Bhutia made a formal announcement about his joining the Sikkim Democratic Front party led by former Chief Minister Pawan Kumar Chamling. On being asked why SDF and not any other political party, Bhutia said, ""Following the exit of corrupt leaders, SDF has now cleansed itself of corruption. For a long time, SKM cried about Chamling being a corrupt leader, but it's evident in these 4 years that SKM has not been able to file a single case against Chamling on corruption. Thus, ensuring that Chamling is free of corruption. Besides, in these 4 years as an opposition, perhaps SDF is the only party that has spoken for Sikkim, their call for Save Sikkim is evidence of the same. Bhaichung and SDF will be like Messi and Argentina to win the World Cup"". #Elections With  Assembly Election News All Madhya Pradesh Rajasthan Telangana Chhattisgarh Mizoram Legacy battles in quite a few seats in three districts of northern Rajasthan Rajasthan Assembly Elections: Not projecting CMs in states a strategy, says Rajnath Singh Congress did not implement Mandal commission report, says BSP chief Mayawati in Telangana Rahul Gandhi has become 'national problem', claims BJP's Shivraj Chouhan At the previous election, Bhaichung had supported the ruling Sikkim Krantikari Morcha and even held a meeting with current Chief Minister Prem Singh Golay in the run-up to the 2019 election. Bhutia claimed, ""We were all in support of Parivartan's promise made by Prem Singh Golay in 2019. We tactically fielded candidates where the SKM had weaker candidates in constituencies. We wanted the Parivartan as much as SKM did. However, in these 4 years, the Parivartan has failed under Golay and SKM. They are now full of corrupt leaders and businessmen who, in the past, ruined 25 years of work by the ruling SDF party"". In 2014 after his retirement from football, Bhutia had joined the All India Trinamool Congress and unsuccessfully contested the 2014 Indian general election from Darjeeling constituency. In 2018, after the break up with All India Trinamool Congress, he established a new party on in Sikkim called the ""Hamro Sikkim Party"". Experience Your Economic Times Newspaper, The Digital Way!

september (1.2% below its september 2019 total and 22% higher than in september 2022). another highlight this quarter was the integration of the seven airports in cabo verde, where traffic has been trending up for months. international traffic, in particular, is approximately 10 points higher than in 2019 including solid figures on flights connecting tourist destinations sal, boa vista and são vicente to cities in western europe including lisbon and paris. unless stated otherwise, all variations in following paragraphs refer to traffic levels in q3 2023as compared to the same period in 2022. reflecting the robust trends in traffic this summer, passenger numbers broke several records in september. inmexico,for example, local and united-states-based airlines continued to increase frequencies on existing lines and opened new ones, both international (traffic to and from the us rose 21%) and domestic (up 18%). traffic may continue to increase in the coming months as viva aerobus and aeroméxico have announced new services following the faa’s decision to upgrade mexico to category 11(for instance between monterrey and atlanta, los angeles, new york and salt lake city). traffic was also at an all-time high this september in thedominican republicandcosta rica, as passenger numbers between the us and both those countries remain high. the situation is similar in serbia: traffic at the airport inbelgradecontinues to increase thanks to wizz air (up 54%) and air serbia (up 33%), as well as other carriers such as turkish airlines (up 33%) and swiss international (up 26%), which underscores the airport’s appeal and potential. in portugal,services to the country’s islands and to cities across europe remain very busy, reflecting traffic growth among low-cost carriers (ryanair up 16%, easyjet up 24%, transavia up 13%). transatlantic flights also grew significantly as tap, latam, major us and canadian airlines (incl. united airlines and american airlines) stepped up capacity to and from the us, brazil and canada. other airports also handled more traffic this summer than last and continue to see their passenger numbers rise with healthy figures on their international connections.infrance, low-cost carriers volotea, easyjet, ryanair and transavia are adding the most capacity on domestic flights in nantes and on international ones in lyon (north africa, spain, portugal, united kingdom). this summer saw several significant announcements regarding long-haul connections at lyon: qatar airways will start direct flights to doha in july and air canada will restart flights from montreal. traffic atlondon gatwickexceeded that in summer 2022 despite the air traffic control disruptions. in addition to a busy schedule of european services, the airport is seeing significant growth in long-haul flights in general and transatlantic ones in particular (with a 92% increase in passengers flying to and from the us with norse atlantic and british airways). injapan,passenger numbers on some services within asia remain steady (south korea, hong kong, taiwan) while traffic to and from china is increasing. several airlines (including ana, japan airlines, singapore airlines, qatar airways, lufthansa, etihad and china airlines) announced plans to increase capacity in coming months, which should help to push international traffic back to levels

"3 November 2023 - Myanmar witnessed a sharp escalation in fighting between the military and opposition groups this week fuelling a surge in new displacements, the UN humanitarian wing has said. Clashes intensified on Sunday and continued through the week, significantly impacting northeast and southeast Myanmar and forcing over 48,000 people from their homes, amid rising needs, according to the UN Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA). There are also reports that an alliance of three rebel groups seized towns in the country's north, overrunning and occupying over 90 army outposts. The military has reportedly acknowledged the loss of at least three towns. Routes cutoff In a flash update issued late on Thursday, OCHA reported that vital transport links connecting northern Shan to China had been obstructed by the Myanmar Armed Forces (MAF) and Ethic Armed Organization (EAOs) checkpoints. At least one critical bridge had been destroyed, with numerous places in northern Shan, eastern Bago and Kayin states facing ""extensive disruptions"" in mobile data and telecommunications. Thirteen civilians, including children, lost their lives in the fighting in various locations, and a further two died after they were unable to access emergency medical services, according to the flash update. Several people are reported to have been injured. Humanitarian needs According to OCHA, in northern Shan state, faith-based organizations and host communities are delivering immediate assistance, including shelter, food, drinking water, hygiene supplies and non-food items. Almost all of the people newly displaced since 27 October are seeking refuge in religious compounds and few are known to have entered pre-existing Internally Displaced Persons (IDP) sites. Gaps and challenges OCHA underscored the need for secure and unimpeded humanitarian access to deliver timely assistance. It added that disrupted telecommunications, particularly in northern Shan, is hindering relief work. ""Ongoing hostilities, coupled with the existence of checkpoints, road closures, and structural damage to bridges, are severely restricting the ability of humanitarian agencies to reach affected people, conduct verification of needs, and transport vital supplies,"" it said. Human rights situation Meanwhile, the human rights crisis in the country ""is bad and is getting exponentially worse"", Special Rapporteur Tom Andrews said. In an interview with UN News last week in New York, on the margins of his report to the General Assembly, the independent human rights expert described the situation in the country, adding that no one is safe. Special Rapporteurs and other independent experts are appointed by the UN Human Rights Council and form part of what is known as its Special Procedures.

""but when it comes to doing interesting things, they like to start elsewhere."" google's lawyers showed raghavan a 1998 article from fortune magazine which said ""yahoo! has won the search-engine wars and is poised for much bigger things."" raghavan, who once worked at yahoo!, said google spends massive amounts on research and development to try to stay ahead of the curve as technology evolves. ""i feel a keen sense not to become the next roadkill,"" he said. the justice department has presented evidence that google secured its dominance in search by paying billions of dollars annually to apple and other companies tolock in google as the default search engineon iphones and other popular products. a microsoft executive also testified that google's pre-eminent position becomes self-fulfilling, as it uses the data it aggregates from the billions of searches it conducts to improve the efficiency of future searches. google says its search engine is dominant because it has a better product than its competitors. the company said it invested in mobile devices and other emerging technologies more quickly than competitors like microsoft, and that those investments are now paying off. and it cited evidence that consumers switch their search engine to google the majority of the time in cases where another search engine is offered as the default choice. raghavan, in his testimony, also said google's competition is not just traditional search engines like microsoft's bing, but various ""verticals"" like expedia or yelp that people use to facilitate travel or dining. ""we feel ourselves competing with them every day,"" he said. the antitrust case, the biggest since the justice department went after microsoft and its dominance of internet browsers 25 years ago, was filed in 2020 during the trump administration. the trial began last month, and google is expected to present its case over the next month. u.s. district judge amit mehta is not expected to rule until early next year. if he decides google broke the law, another trial will determine how to rein in its market power. one option would be to prohibit google from paying companies to make google a default search engine. google is also facing a similar antitrust lawsuit filed by the justice department in alexandria, virginia, over its advertising technology. that case has not yet gone to trial.","Google's senior vice president for knowledge and information products testified for the tech giant as it defends itself in the biggest antitrust trial in the last 25 years. prabhakar raghavan downplayedgoogle's dominance and described it as a company beset by competitors on all sides.

"Global Times By GT staff reporters Published: Nov 20, 2023 08:58 PM The People's Bank of China (PBC), the central bank, and the Saudi Central Bank have signed a local currency swap agreement. The swap size is 50 billion yuan ($6.98 billion) or 26 billion Saudi riyals. It will be valid for three years and can be extended by mutual agreement, the PBC said on Monday in a statement. The swap arrangement, which has been approved by the State Council, will strengthen financial cooperation, expand the use of both currencies and promote trade and investment facilitation, read the statement. Amid the continued internationalization of the yuan, experts said that the swap will have a demonstration effect and encourage more countries in the Middle East to follow suit. The agreement is a breakthrough to promote the use of the yuan in the Middle East and an opportunity to advance the yuan's global use, Xi Junyang, a professor at the Shanghai University of Finance and Economics, told the Global Times on Monday. Saudi Arabian businesses can use the yuan in more scenarios with fewer restrictions, especially for international trade and external economic cooperation, said Xi, adding that the deal may facilitate bilateral energy trade. For instance, as one of the largest crude oil producers in the world, Saudi Arabia usually uses the US dollar for its international trade, Xi added. Observers said that the use of the yuan may bolster bilateral crude exchanges. In 2022, China imported 508 million tons of crude oil, and half of the top 10 sources were Arab countries, with Saudi Arabia ranked first, according to China Petrochem. The report added that about one-quarter of Saudi Arabia's crude oil has been exported to China in recent years. China is the largest importer of crude oil from Saudi Arabia. More and more countries now prefer to use local currencies to settle foreign trade deals to reduce their reliance on the US dollar, said Xi. Saudi Arabia's pioneering move may play a vital role in boosting the yuan's use among regional countries, which will also support the currency's internationalization, he noted. Chinese authorities are striving to promote the yuan's internationalization. China's central bank has vowed to promote the internationalization of the yuan earlier this month in a steady and prudent manner, with targets set for the opening-up of the financial market. Facilitation of the use of the yuan as an international currency is an important highlight. The PBC said that continuous efforts will be made to steadily advance bilateral currency swaps and local currency settlement cooperation with other central banks, including effectively leveraging currency swaps to support the development of the offshore yuan market and facilitate trade and investment.","The swap size is 50 billion yuan ($6.98 billion) or 26 billion Saudi riyals.

"BANGKOK: An ethnic minority armed group in Myanmar has seized control from the country’s ruling junta of a lucrative border crossingto China, local media and a security source said Sunday. Clashes have raged across Myanmar’s northern Shan state, close to the Chinese border, after an armed alliance of three ethnic minority groups launched an offensive against the military in October.The groups have seized dozens of military positions and a town important for trade with China, choking commerce routes for the cash-strapped junta.An offensive by the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army (MNDAA) — one of the three allied groups — captured the Kyin San Kyawt border gate, a local media outlet affiliated with the group said. “MNDAA also reported they seized one more border trade gate, which is called Kyin San Kyawt, in Mongko area, Muse district this morning,” the Kokang news reported Sunday. It added that the alliance — including the Arakan Army (AA) and Ta’ang National Liberation Army (TNLA) — had taken other positions in the border trade zone after the assault began on Friday.MNDAA had raised its flag at the border trade zone at Kyin San Kyawt, a security source said. The gate was re-opened in 2022 after the pandemic, and is a major trading point along the Myanmar-China border. Earlier in the week, junta spokesman Zaw Min Tun told state media that roughly 120 trucks, parked near the border crossing, had gone up in flames and blamed armed groups. The uptick in fighting has battered Myanmar’s already struggl ing economy, damaging vital crossborder commerce.","Clashes have raged across Myanmar’s northern Shan state, close to the Chinese border.

"How to use Dupeshop Dupes have gained an undeserved bad reputation, often used synonymously with illegal counterfeits of high-end, luxury branded goods. There is a world of difference between the two. A counterfeit product is intended to deceive by using unauthorized trademarks. A dupe is a duplicate that is a near-identical substitute for a high-end product at a lower price; the trick is to find it. That’s easy in many categories, but it can be especially problematic in beauty where brands sell “hope in a bottle.” Dupeshop Beauty has solved for that, using a science-based approach to study product formulas and test them with a team of industry experts to find authentic dupes.

"AP Bernard Ruiz-Picasso, grandson of artist Pablo Picasso, attends the Picasso: 14 Sketchbooks exhibit at Pace Gallery in New York, Thursday, Nov. 9, 2023. (AP Photo/Peter K. Afriyie) New York : He was a giant of 20th-century art, but that doesn't mean  Pablo Picasso  needed a big canvas.   Matchbook  covers, postcards, restaurant napkins - they all served as makeshift sketchpads for the artist at moments of inspiration.  And so it should perhaps not be surprising that some of Picasso's actual sketchpads were well smaller than, say, a compact disc cover - like the tiny one now on display at Manhattan's  Pace Gallery  as part of 'Picasso: 14 Sketchbooks' a new exhibit marking 50 years since the legendary artist's death.  A stunningly complete self-portrait in pencil peeks out of that little book, with deep and piercing eyes, all 3 ¾ by 5 ½ inches of it. It was 1918 and Picasso, then in his mid-30s, had just married ballet dancer Olga Khokhlova. During a summer in balmy Biarritz, he painted on canvas but also kept this tiny notebook around, filling it with scenes of their villa, the beach and the town, and sketches of upcoming paintings. He also drafted a letter to his wife's doctor and listed addresses of friends.  The exhibit, which opened Friday, is a collaboration with the Madrid foundation run by a grandson of Picasso's, Bernard Ruiz-Picasso. It comes nearly 40 years after the gallery's initial 1986 show of  Picasso  sketchbooks, called 'Je Suis le Cahier (I am the Sketchbook)' after a notation Picasso made on one of his pads - which subsequently toured the globe.  The show comes at a busy time for Picasso developments - even in New York this very week, where the artist's famed 1932 ""Femme a la montre"" (""Woman with a Watch""), portraying his muse Marie-Therese Walter, sold for $139.4 million at Sotheby's on Wednesday evening, making it the second most valuable Picasso ever sold at auction.   ""He is the greatest artist of the modern period, and in many ways he thought of himself as a sketchbook,"" said Pace CEO Marc Glimcher, speaking to a crowd at a preview Thursday, referring to Picasso's efforts to refine his work through copious sketching.  He sounded almost evangelical when he urged the young people present to recognize that ""everyone in this room sees the world differently because of Pablo Picasso.""  In an interview, Glimcher explained that he feels the world needs to be reminded of Picasso's achievements at a time in our culture where, he said, it seems everything and everyone is being questioned anew. He also noted what he called the icon effect: ""When something becomes so iconic it becomes by necessity oversimplified,"" he said. ""People say, 'Oh, Picasso, got it.' We have to make sure they DO get it.""  The show, in one large gallery, is organized chronologically, spanning the years 1900-1959, most of Picasso's career (he died in 1973). Each of the 14 sketchbooks is presented in context with what was going on in his life - including in his romantic relationships, which figured so prominently in his artwork.  Many of the sketches are early versions of famed paintings like 'Les Demoiselles d'Avignon' (1907), for which one sketchbook tests out various figure renderings; 'Dora Maar in an Armchair' (1939); and his 'War and Peace' murals, for a chapel in southern France, that were finished in 1952.  There is also a film of Picasso, shirtless and in shorts, preparing for those giant murals, needing a ladder to reach the top of his canvas - and reminding us of the dimension of some of his masterworks.  But elsewhere in the show, the gems are in miniature size. Some of the images are fanciful, like the monsters and clownlike figures, some in bright blue and red pencil, from a 1956-1957 sketchbook that resembles a whimsical children's book.  Others feel precise and more technical like the ink drawings in his Juan-les-Pins sketchbooks, from 1924, in which he experiments with shapes of guitars and other objects through patterns of dots and lines, known as ""constellations."" A long poem also appears in one of the sketchbooks, translated in an accompanying catalog.  With each sketchbook open to only one page, how to uncover the rest? The gallery's solution is to provide subsequent pages in video displays on a loop.  Ruiz-Picasso, the artist's grandson and son of  Paul Picasso , said the sketchbooks deserve a fresh look because much has happened in the past few decades in terms of research into Picasso's work and the context in which it was produced.   ""We have better information now about what he was doing,"" Ruiz-Picasso said in an interview. ""It's a kind of archaeological dimension, where we can go more deeply.""  Ruiz-Picasso, who was 13 when his grandfather died, remembers children not being entirely welcome in the studio where the artist painted in Mougins, France, where he lived out his later years. But elsewhere in the home, he remembers him always sketching ""until the last piece of paper available.""  ""He was permanently doing something,"" Ruiz-Picasso said.

"rami aman knows what it's like to stand up to hamas, while living under its rule in gaza, and to seek peace with israeli civilians: doing so got him tortured and pushed into exile. in 2020, aman, a leader of the gaza youth committee who now lives in cairo, was thrown into a jail in gaza city for organizing a cross-border video call. ""skype with your enemy,"" it was called — an effort to bypass hostile political leaders on both sides and build relationships between regular people in israel and palestine. aman, jailed, was blindfolded and placed in stress positions for weeks at a time and ultimately coerced into leaving the palestinian territory. so when israeli president isaac herzog this week chided residents of gaza for not overthrowing hamas — ""they could have risen up, they could have fought against that evil regime,""he said— aman took umbrage. not only did he do just that, at great personal cost, but thousands of other palestinians defied the militant group, protesting hamas' rule and its bungling of basic governance; as the associated pressreported, ""hamas' security forces quickly dispersed the gathering."" amid an israeli attack, the most intensive in the history of gaza, such protests are an impossibility. no one will ""make any kind of revolution against hamas under the israeli missile,"" aman told insider in an interview. it will have the opposite effect. ""they are creating more hamas, more hamas, more hamas,"" he said — an entire new ""generation"" of people radicalized by israeli bombardment and the propaganda of armed extremists claiming to defend them. as the times of israelnoted this past week, there had been — until the massacre of more than 1,300 israelis, the vast majority civilians — something of a symbiotic relationship between the terrorist organization and the israeli government under prime minister benjamin netanyahu, who has long opposed the creation of a palestinian state. so long as hamas remained in control of the gaza strip, while their rival fatah ruled parts of the west bank, statehood would simply not be viable. the conventional wisdom was that hamas' misdeeds would generally be inflicted on those over whom it ruled, since coming to power in a 2006 election; an extremist group operating next to southern israel would also weaken voices within the country calling for a negotiated settlement with the palestinians. ""most of the people in gaza do not support hamas,"" aman said, characterizing the 2006 election as a protest vote against corruption and the failure of the peace process. indeed, a recent poll by the washington institutefound thata large majority wanted gaza's day-to-day governance to be led by the palestinian authority, based in the west bank, and for hamas to maintain its ceasefire with israel — knowing they would pay the price for breaking it, not the leadership of hamas in qatar. ""i believe that what is happening now, it will not destroy hamas,"" aman said. ""it will destroy the people and all the people in the gaza strip,"" he continued, arguing that the terrorist group and the israel defense forces each only know violence and that their respective sponsors should instead be working to negotiate prisoner exchange (hamas abducted over 150 israeli civilians, including women, children, and an elderly holocaust survivor, while over a thousand palestinians are currently being held without charge within israel, according to israeli human rights group b'tselem). ""we need to stop this war, now, and start thinking about how we can release all women and kids and babies and civilians who are arrested and kidnapped, not just from last saturday,"" aman said. instead of viewing the majority of gaza's residents with suspicion over a massacre carried out by the armed extremists who oppress them, aman said they should be seen as men, women, and children who have little power over their own fate but desire the same life. and outside powers should be encouraging all sides to deescalate, another cycle of violence seeding more death and destruction down the line. gazans ""are now looking at america and [see] that they are targeting them,"" aman said. ""american sends many things, many weapons — a battleship — to israel. for what? we don't need more missiles. we need america to send water, to send food — to build."" diplomacy, he argued, should be the united states' export to the region. ""we need america to host an initiative, for both people, not to 'stand' with anyone,"" he continued. ""and we don't need russia to 'stand' with the palestinians. no, i need a country to stand with humans. i'm very upset. i'm very sad and the situation is very bad. but i believe that there are israelis and there are palestinians — they are talking, not just fighting, and believe that we can live in a good future."" ""israeli and palestinian, in this conflict? both of them are losers. no need to blame each other. both of us are killers, and both of us are paying the price,"" he said.

"atlanta (ap) — lawyer kenneth chesebro pleaded guilty to a felony on friday just as jury selection was getting underway in his trial oncharges accusing himof participating in efforts to overturndonald trump’s lossin the 2020 election in georgia. chesebro, who was charged alongside trump and 17 others with violating the state’s anti-racketeering law, pleaded guilty to one felony charge of conspiracy to commit filing false documents in a last-minute deal. his plea came a day after fellow attorneysidney powell, who had been scheduled to go to trial alongside him,entered her own guilty pleato six misdemeanor counts. in chesebro's case, he was sentenced to five years’ probation and 100 hours of community service and was ordered to pay $5,000 in restitution, write an apology letter to georgia’s residents and testify truthfully at any related future trial. the two guilty pleas — along with a third for a bail bondsman last month — are major victories for fulton county district attorney fani willis, who obtained the indictment in august. they allow her to avoid a lengthy trial of just two defendants — which would have given those remaining a peek at her trial strategy — and to whittle down an unwieldy pool of defendants. chesebro, who lives in puerto rico, was initially charged with felony racketeering and six other counts as part of a wide-ranging scheme to keep the republican president in power afterhe lost the 2020 electionto democrat joe biden. the indictment alleges chesebrocoordinated and executed a planto have 16 georgia republicans sign a certificate declaring falsely that trump won the state and declaring themselves the state’s “duly elected and qualified” electors. for prosecutors, the plea deal assures that chesebro publicly accepts responsibility for his conduct in the case and removes the uncertainty of a trial by a jury of his peers. it also compels him to testify about communications he had with trump’s campaign lawyers and close associates, including co-defendant rudy giuliani, the former new york mayor and a trump attorney. jury selection had been set to start friday forthe trial of powell and chesebroafter each filed a demand for a speedy trial. once powell pleaded guilty, chesebro had been set to continue to trial on his own. as part of powell's deal, she will serve six years of probation, will be fined $6,000 and will have to write an apology letter to georgia and its residents. she also recorded a statement for prosecutors and agreed to testify truthfully against her co-defendants at future trials. a lower-profile defendant in the case, bail bondsman scott graham hall,pleaded guiltylast month to five misdemeanor charges. he was sentenced to five years of probation and agreed to testify in further proceedings. all ofthe other defendants, including trump white house chief of staffmark meadows, have pleaded not guilty. prosecutors allege that chesebro unlawfully conspired with trump and lawyers associated with his campaign to have the group of georgia republicans sign the false elector certificate and to submit it to various federal authorities. he also communicated with trump campaign lawyers and republican leaders in other swing states won by biden to get those states to submit false slates of electors as well, prosecutors alleged. that included writing memos advocating for republicans in those states to meet and cast electoral votes for trump and providing detailed instructions for how the process should be carried out. in an email to giuliani, he outlined strategies to disrupt and delay the joint session of congress on jan. 6, 2021, during which electoral votes were to be certified. he wrote that those strategies were ""preferable to allowing the electoral count act to operate by its terms.”","Kenneth chesebro, who was charged alongside trump and 17 others with violating the state’s anti-racketeering law, pleaded guilty to one felony charge of conspiracy to commit filing false documents. his plea came a day after fellow attorneysidney powell, who had been scheduled to go to trial alongside him,entered her own guilty pleato six misdemeanor counts.","On 11 April 2023, Kenneth chesebro, who was charged alongside trump and 17 others with violating the state’s anti-racketeering law, pleaded guilty to one felony charge of conspiracy to commit filing false documents. his plea came a day after fellow attorneysidney powell, who had been scheduled to go to trial alongside him,entered her own guilty pleato six misdemeanor counts.

Authorities are investigating whether the shootingwas motivated by hateas it came against a backdrop of increasing bias incidents in the US since the Israel-Hamas war erupted.

"Inflationcooled but is still above the Fed's 2% target per the year-over-year change in the Consumer Price Index, or CPI, for October. The Consumer Price Index increased 3.2% year over year in October, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data released Tuesday. The year-over-year increase in October was just less than theforecastof 3.3%, and the increase is less than theSeptember's 3.7% year-over-year increase. September's change was the same as the 3.7% rise inAugustbased on data that's not seasonally adjusted. Meanwhile, the CPI neither increased nor fell in October from the preceding month per seasonally adjusted data, with a change of 0.0%. An increase of 0.1% was the forecast. This change follows a 0.4% increase in September. Core CPI, which is the index excluding food and energy, rose 4.0% over the year ending October. That increase is just below the 4.1% increase seen over the year ending September. An increase of 4.1% was also the forecast. Core CPI rose 0.2% from September to October, below the 0.3% increase from August to September. It was expected to rise by 0.3% month over month again. ""The index for shelter continued to rise in October, offsetting a decline in the gasoline index and resulting in the seasonally adjusted index being unchanged over the month,"" a news release from the Bureau of Labor Statistics on Tuesday stated. The shelter index increased 6.7% for the 12 months ending October based on not seasonally adjusted data, which means it is still slowing down. The index rose 0.3% month over month based on seasonally adjusted data, which is a smaller increase than the 0.6% before it. The food index didn't see as large an increase as the shelter index, with a year-over-year increase of 3.3%. The energy index saw a decline of 4.5% year over year in October. The index also fell 2.5% in October from the previous month. Fuel oil declined by 21.4% year over year, while gasoline of all types decreased by 5.3%. Additionally, after various month-over-month increases, the index for gasoline actually fell. It declined 5.0% in October from the preceding month. David Kelly, chief global strategist of J.P. Morgan Asset Management, wrote in a note ahead of the CPI release that looking broadly and not just at CPI figures, ""the path to lower inflation remains intact."" ""October's global composite PMI came in at 50.0 — its lowest reading since January — while supply chain pressures continue to ease,"" Kelly said. ""New data on global food commodity prices, energy prices, hotel rates and used car prices all suggest weakening inflation as does a continuedmoderation in wage growthin the October jobs' report."" Jerome Powell, chair of the Federal Reserve, said on November 9 at a policy panel that the Federal Open Market Committee ""is committed to achieving a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation down to 2% over time; we are not confident that we have achieved such a stance."" ""If it becomes appropriate to tighten policy further, we will not hesitate to do so,"" Powell said. ""We will continue to move carefully, however, allowing us to address both the risk of being misled by a few good months of data, and the risk of overtightening."" This is a developing story.

I asked him about the huge civilian death toll and he insisted the IDF is doing all it can to minimize casualties. The devastation all around suggests a less cautious approach. We joined a convoy of a few dozen heavily armed soldiers, and more than ten tanks and armored personnel carriers. At one point an explosion and flames to the side of the road, an IED or mine. When we finally dismounted, the air was thick with dust and smoke. The sound of war interrupts the uneasy moments of silence; the crackle of gunfire, the crump of tank fire.  This is an army full of determination and confidence, it has immense firepower at its disposal but the urban warfare they are in is perhaps the most dangerous an army can face.

"Thanksgiving is almost here and it’s a special time for Star Wars fans. That’s because 45 years ago, it was during Thanksgiving week that a Star Wars event for the ages took place.

It’s an absolute dream as evidenced by this trailer. Check it out. Again, for more details on the film itself, check out our rave review at this link.

Then Christmas Eve, we haven’t figured out whose house yet, but I’ll probably do Christmas night. I do a brunch on Christmas Eve with the parade on and it’s strictly the family and the children.” Today, Hilton is a grandma several times over, including when Paris welcomed her son Phoenix via surrogate earlier this year, a surprise Hilton was not expecting, as cameras captured the big reveal during the filming of season two of Paris In Love, premiering November 30 on Peacock. Kathy Hilton with her daughter Paris Hilton and her grandson Phoenix. Hilton said, “What’s nice is we really do forget the cameras are there and I get to meet Phoenix for the first time, which was mind-blowing. I thought it was a monkey or a little doggie that [Paris] had. I thought it was a dog for me or she bought a new monkey.” She went on to say that becoming a grandmother has created a whole new relationship with her children, including her sons Barron and Conrad. “Everybody’s priority changed a little bit. They understand - we have to plan things. We can’t just run and do things off the cuff. We have to plan it out.” Speaking of planning, Hilton has teamed up with DIRECTV to put on “Christmas at Kathy’s” at her Los Angeles, California home on November 28. ""Christmas at Kathy's"" holiday fundraiser event with DIRECTV. “I’m inviting my sisters and some of my friends,” Hilton said, “I think it’s going to be a fun bunch. Very festive and we’re working like mad to get this house looking like a fairy tale in every room. The food will be great, there will be caroling and collecting all the [toy drive] gifts to bring everybody together for Ronald McDonald House Charities of Southern California. Everyone will leave that night feeling like they did their part.” Kelly Jo Sands, SVP of Digital & Marketing at DIRECTV, said of their new collaboration, “I think Kathy Hilton stands out for most fans because she is always her authentic self, no matter what the situation. The ever-changing entertainment landscape means that at DIRECTV, we have to be creative in our approach to engaging customers. One way we have done that this year has been through partnerships in sports, specifically college sports. Now as the winter approaches, you’ll see us lean more into the entertainment world. Kathy Hilton is the perfect person to kick this off with because she is a true philanthropist who has brought DIRECTV customers on her journey for so many years.” Hilton added that she decided to join forces with DIRECTV for her holiday gathering because she loves TV and Christmas movies, particularly Miracle of 34th Street (1947) and Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer (1964), and wants “to be able to watch anything and everything.” Being a self-described entrepreneur today, after years of owning her own retail store in New York, followed by her years on QVC and HSN, and ultimately launching her The Kathy Hilton Collection of dresses in 2012, I wondered how Hilton has best maneuvered in her business ways through the recent advancements in technology with social media, compared to her communication methods when she first started out as a working professional years ago. Kathy Hiton with her daughter Nicky Rothschild “Now, I’m able to meet people - with the DM (Direct Message) [on Instagram] and then they’re reaching out to me and collaborations. You can get your product across and reach so many people. Now, I want to take it to a different level and I have a couple of huge companies that have come to Nicky and me. It’s very exciting. We just had a big meeting in New York, and as I became a mother and a grandmother, when the girls became older, Nicky really has taken to - we have very much the same taste, so kind of looking to do a mom and daughter [business].” Being the matriarch of the expanding Hilton dynasty, I wondered what she would say might surprise people about her well-known family and their inner-workings that the public does not often get to see when the cameras are not rolling. Hilton said, “Well, I think we all - the people pretty much know we work really hard. My husband and I started out, been married - we’re going to be celebrating our anniversary November 24. We’re self-made and I’m really, really proud of that. You can google that.” Now at 64, what message does Hilton have for other creatives out there, who might question if it is too far past their prime to be able to truly pivot in their careers? Kathy Hilton and several of her ""Real Housewives of Beverly Hills"" reality co-stars.  “First of all, never in my life did I think I would go on the Housewives. If you had told me even three, four years ago, I would say you are out of your mind. Who would’ve thought? It’s never too late, and obviously being on TV, there’s a lot of eyeballs on you. If you can have a platform to be a good person and do things for others and have a business at the same time, it’s a win/win. I think don’t give up - just keep going for it.” As I concluded my conversation with Hilton, I wondered, despite the difficult times happening around our world lately, what message might she have for other individuals and families right now, hoping to enjoy themselves this holiday season alongside loved ones, even with so many people living with heavy hearts. Hilton said, “Oh boy. We’re all basically at the end of the day, we’re specs of sand on the beach and we really have to try to be as kind as we can. I’ve gotten a lot more into prayer - I am a lot more spiritual. I think you have to have hope and I think we have to be really sensitive to others. We don’t know what’s going on - what’ they’re feeling, what’s happening. Everybody wants to make everything so great and wonderful, especially on Instagram, and that’s not real. I think prayer at the end of the day - having a belief and faith. Faith, faith, faith!”","Kathy Hilton has been pivoting in her focuses lately, as both her business opportunities and her family continue to grow. “First and foremost, I’m a philanthropist and I spend a lot of my time doing philanthropy on different boards. Basically, everything that I do publicly or my own personal holiday party always is doing something to give back to whoever it may be,” she said.","On 09 May 2023, Kathy Hilton has been pivoting in her focuses lately, as both her business opportunities and her family continue to grow. “First and foremost, I’m a philanthropist and I spend a lot of my time doing philanthropy on different boards.

(anecdotally, i did the work the door for an audition session for the faire some 16 years ago or so, and everyone i met who was working there in an official capacity was indeed a prick.) but even those personal biases aside: it's always beautiful to see the peasants rise up to overthrow the bastard king. if you want more details, there is a call to action for organizing at the end of thereddit post.","King's faire reportedly nets over $400,000 per day.

"The UK government is to spend millions of pounds helping countries prepare for future humanitarian disasters in a radical shake-up of its development policy, the BBC has learned.   A new £150m fund will help poorer countries get access to money faster in emergencies and reduce the impact of future climate crises.   The change is expected to be part of a new White Paper designed to make Britain's foreign aid spending go further while also finding new sources of international finance. Ministers hope the 140-page policy document - published on Monday - can help restore Britain's reputation as a development superpower after years of aid cuts.   It is understood the paper has been endorsed by world leaders, global philanthropists and international finance chiefs.   Ministers are also hoping to win cross-party support in Parliament so the seven-year plans survive beyond the next election regardless of the outcome.  The central idea of the White Paper is that conflict, climate and Covid have changed and blighted the world so much that countries must think differently about development.   It will argue that instead of wealthier states just handing out money, they should form new partnerships with developing countries - based on mutual respect - within an international system that finances new ways of tackling extreme poverty.   The government's plans will not involve spending more taxpayers' money - the UK will continue to allocate 0.5% of its national income on foreign aid each year, which in 2022 was about £12bn.   But the document will set out how to make the cash go further. The government currently plans to spend about £1bn on humanitarian aid in 2024. The new ""resilience and adaption fund"" will automatically take 15% of that money, which will be used to help countries prepare for future humanitarian and climate disasters.   So a drought-stricken country would not just get emergency food and water in the short term, but also investment in wells and reservoirs to help reduce the impact and cost of future emergencies.   There are also plans for special insurance schemes and pre-agreed contingency funds to ensure countries can get access to humanitarian cash the moment disaster strikes, instead of having to wait for donor countries to raise the money which can take some time.  Developing countries may also automatically be able to stop paying back international debts in times of crisis.   The White Paper is expected to set out plans to unlock more private finance to help the world meet the United Nations sustainable development goals, known as SDGs.   These plans - to cut poverty, hunger and inequality and boost education, health and climate action - were agreed in 2015. But the targets are considered widely off track and unlikely to be met by their 2030 end date.   The idea is to use the balance sheets of international financial institutions, such as the World Bank and the IMF, to guarantee greater investment in development from private capital such as pension funds.   The government also plans to reduce the costs incurred by workers in richer countries when they send money to families back home in developing countries.  The global value of so-called ""remittances"" is huge, about £520bn each year, which is three times as much as all overseas development assistance given by governments.   But up to 35% of the value of ""remittances"" can be lost in currency and transaction fees, which could be reduced through sharing more technology and regulatory expertise.   The government's development and Africa minister, Andrew Mitchell, said Monday's White Paper should be seen as a restatement of the value of aid and a glimmer of hope in dark times.   ""Our world is troubled and fragmented,"" he said. ""Do we give up on it? Or do we act?  ""The White Paper is our plan to make the world a better and safer place with solutions that are in the UK's gift to deliver. We have the will and the way to make a difference.""","New £150m fund will help poorer countries get access to money faster in emergencies.

""nathan winter of the newton police department convicted of domestic abuse after beating up his ex girlfriend,"" galanakis wrote in one caption. a subsequent caption stated that winters had ""beat the shit out of"" his girlfriend. though winters had a protective order filed against him, the counterclaim states that he has not been charged or convicted of domestic abuse. locher agreed that on this basis claims of defamation and false-light invasion of privacy for both winter and wing (because of the implication that wing did nothing to discipline winters) can proceed. as ridiculous as the cops' lawsuit is, i can understand why the a court might at least entertain the libel claim, though i think locher is playing games given that he recognized every other thing said as blatantly hyperbolic teen trash talk except one thing that he poses as a solemn statement of fact. but to let the invasion of privacy claim proceed seems, to borrow a legal term, to beasking for it.","19-year-old tayvin galanakis posted video of his traffic stop, along with his mocking commentary on the officers who falsely arrested him, and it went viral, amassing millions of views on youtube.

"WILMINGTON, Del., Nov.  15, 2023  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The features and functionality of 5G-Advanced means the technology is primed for enterprise—but only if mobile operators can consider its applications and turn use cases into practical solutions. This is according to a new report commissioned by InterDigital, Inc. (Nasdaq: IDCC), a mobile and video technology research and development company, and written by market research firm ABI Research, which highlights why this latest network generation has not yet realized its potential in unlocking new business opportunities. Rapid adoption of 5G over the past three years makes it the most quickly adopted cellular generation to date. Efforts in the past four years (2018-2022) have focused on the foundational development of 5G, laying the groundwork for the new cellular generation and enhancing network capacity, speed, and latency. Yet operators have struggled to tap into the enterprise market and to realise the IMT-2020 vision for 5G, which is oriented beyond mobile broadband. The new report,The State of 5G-Advanced: Empowering New Verticals and Industries, outlines the development of 5G-Advanced and its new features that will see enhancements to existing 5G technology over the next three years (2023-2026). These will be dedicated to the transformational phase of 5G, or 5G-Advanced, and will improve existing specifications, while also introducing new features that aim to optimize network operations and pave the way for innovative enterprise use cases and business models that have not been feasible with earlier generations. These features include: “The collective research and innovation efforts of the entire industry have laid an important foundation in 5G, but we must recognise that it’s not ‘finished’ and has yet to achieve its full potential,” said Milind Kulkarni, VP and Head of Wireless Labs, InterDigital. “New features will be standardized in 5G Advanced and 6G that significantly improve capabilities for operators but importantly, open new opportunities in enterprise verticals.” Alongside the enterprise opportunity, the report also reveals that 5G-Advanced will be critical for the monetisation of 5G, as well as for improving the energy efficiency of, and integrating automation into, 5G networks. According to the report, 5G-Advanced will deliver the following features and improvements: Despite new functionality introduced in 5G-Advanced, the report also warns that the “build it and they will come” philosophy on which operators have traditionally relied will not be successful in the enterprise domain unless they can fully understand and embrace the long tail of enterprise requirements and pain points. 5G-Advanced’s new functionality can help operators address the enterprise domain, but an additional step is necessary for success: understanding how to deploy and how to market these capabilities to enterprise verticals. “InterDigital has long made significant contributions to wireless development efforts in 3GPP, ETSI, and 6G forums like the Next G Alliance, and will continue to develop technologies that will form the bedrock of new standards that usher in these new features,” InterDigital CTO Rajesh Pankaj added. “We believe the operators will capitalize on these capabilities and drive new applications and use cases that will help us all collectively meet the ambitions set out in IMT-2020 to support the development of other industry sectors.” The biggest priority for 5G-Advanced is to monetize existing 5G networks beyond the consumer domain and start creating large-scale opportunities in the enterprise space. Operators that have already deployed 5G nationwide are well positioned to provide advanced enterprise functionality using their existing networks, translating into a faster Return on Investment (ROI), new revenue streams, and the opportunity to accelerate their public 5G network rollouts further.

"with its massive output of soybeans, beef, cotton and now corn, brazil has become one of the world's top agricultural powers. but its agribusiness industry also faces criticism, especially over destruction of the amazon rainforest. here is an overview of the south american ag giant, which, more than a decade after passing the united states as the world's biggest soy and beef exporter, is set to overtake us corn exports this year and is now eying the cotton crown. brazil's agriculture ministry triumphantly announced recently the sector's output will hit a record 1.15 trillion reais ($230 billion) this year. the country -- the world's fifth-largest by surface area -- is the top producer and exporter of sugar, coffee and soy. it is also the world's top supplier of chicken and beef, and second in cotton, after the united states. agribusiness accounts for nearly one-fourth of brazil's economy, and half its exports in the first half of the year. brazil's emergence as an agricultural giant goes back to portuguese colonial times. fortunes were made here on a succession of commodities: sugarcane, then cotton, rubber and finally coffee, which reigned supreme for more than a century. but the turning point came in the 1960s and 70s, when brazil's then military regime ushered in the so-called ""green revolution"" and encouraged the expansion of agriculture to the amazon and cerrado savanna. fueled by chinese demand, brazil would go on to become the dominant producer of soy, a widely used ingredient in animal feed worldwide. ""research on genetic improvements, techniques to correct soil acidity and fertilizers"" -- plus pesticide development -- have allowed brazil to expand soy, corn and cotton production into tropical regions, state agricultural research company embrapa told afp. brazil is able to harvest two and sometimes three crops a year, thanks to its climate and the development of zero till planting and genetically modified (gmo) crops -- which today account for 80 to 90 percent of the country's soy, corn and cotton output. production of all three has tripled in the past two decades. but the boom has come with controversy. the agribusiness industry has helped fuel deforestation in the amazon, which president luiz inacio lula da silva has vowed to halt. polemics over high rates of deforestation, pesticides and gmo use have hurt brazil's brand in some places, including the european union, which has held off ratifying a free-trade deal with south american bloc mercosur over environmental issues. the agro sector's image has also paid a price internationally for its close association with controversial far-right ex-president jair bolsonaro, who was in office from 2019 to 2022. lula will have to come to terms with the powerful agribusiness lobby if he wants to keep his promise to stop amazon deforestation by 2030, after a surge in destruction under bolsonaro. the veteran leftist, who needs the sector's help to keep the economy growing, is looking to open new markets for brazilian producers via trade deals, notably with top buyer china. for its part, the ag sector is keen to polish its image, with international clients increasingly demanding deforestation-free products. ""meat companies are working particularly hard to make their supply chains traceable, which is fundamental for export value,"" said luiz carlos correa carvalho, president of the brazilian agribusiness association. grain producers meanwhile tout the recent adoption of a sustainable farming deal aimed at protecting the cerrado. environmentalists say that is not enough. ""real progress would be zero deforestation,"" said cristiane mazzetti of greenpeace brazil, who called for new production models that protect biodiversity. the issue is urgent, especially since climate change is already starting to hit agricultural output. ""we have to evolve toward a more sustainable model,"" said britaldo soares filho, a researcher on environmental modeling at the university of minas gerais. ""when agribusiness harms the environment, it's shooting itself in the foot.""","Brazil's agriculture ministry announced recently the sector's output will hit a record 1.15 trillion reais ($230 billion) this year.

"TV For almost fifty years, free TV reigned supreme, starting with the explosion of homes having a TV in the 1950s and continuing well into the 1990s. During that entire time, the public was happy to watch ads (or take a snack break), and was likewise happy to watch whatever the particular channel was playing. It wasn’t until the late 1990s when the number of homes with cable exceeded the number of homes without it. At first, there was a modest fee for basic cable, but then multiple tiers, bundles, and separate channels from multiple suppliers piled on to get many bills to over $100 per month.

"A young woman with a severe disability was failed by a health trust before she died, a watchdog has said. Sofia Cerulli, who died in 2020, had a life-limiting condition and complex needs, which required 24-hour care. Her long-term care package was changed by the Belfast Health and Social Care Trust when she turned 18 in 2019. Sofia's mother Vittoria said the change resulted in a significant fall in the standard of care, a complaint upheld by the Public Services Ombudsman. The ombudsman Margaret Kelly said there was ""a failure to put Sofia, a young woman with a life-limiting condition who was tube fed, on oxygen and needed suctioning, at the centre of this process"". The Belfast Trust has apologised to Sofia's family and offered ""heartfelt condolences on her passing"". Vittoria said her family trusted the children's care team who understood her daughter's needs but that changed after the move to adult services. ""All that we worked on together for 15 years, and was working well, was taken away for lack of planning and for sheer bureaucracy. There was no need to do that,"" she said. ""The last year or so of Sofia's life, instead of enjoying her… we were both worried about keeping her safe."" The Northern Ireland Public Services Ombudsman (Nipso) said she was ""surprised"" the trust dismantled a care package that had been in place for several years and had been working effectively. She also said she was concerned that the adult team did not contact the children's team for their advice or any training in order to provide Sofia with an ongoing standard of care. ""One of the failures we found was that their staff couldn't actually suction Sofia, something she needed several times a day to ensure her health and wellbeing."" A Belfast Trust spokesperson said: ""We fully accept and acknowledge the findings in the Nipso report and have been working to ensure our processes for transition from child to adult care are more robust."" Vittoria said the ombudsman's findings ""showed that Sofia and our family were failed in more ways than we initially realised"". The ombudsman found the change to the care package caused ""the injustice of lost opportunity, distress and anxiety"" for Sofia and her family before she died. ""Sadly due to the subsequent death of the service user, those disruptive and anxious months were among the last that the family had with their precious daughter and sister,"" said Ms Kelly. She also said: ""The trust failed to engage in the process of transition as early as it should have done."" The earliest record the trust provided of Adult Services' involvement was one month before Sofia's 18th birthday. Ms Kelly noted that ""opportunities were lost for decision makers to build relationships with the service user and her family"". She also found ""care plans were incomplete and insufficient at the commencement of the new care package"" and that there were gaps in documentation. It was recommended that the chief executive of the Belfast Trust apologise to Sofia's mother and that it develops policy and procedures to govern the transition between child and adult services. The ombudsman said there was a ""significant and unacceptable gap and one which requires to be remedied urgently"". ""There are probably around 80 young people at any given time across trusts in Northern Ireland who are moving from children's to adult services with a life-limiting condition. ""The policy should have been there and the trust should have known how to provide this care."" Vittoria said the recommended changes would make a difference for the families of children with complex needs. ""It's too late for Sofia but that will be her legacy to those children,"" she added. The Belfast Trust said it had been working on the implementation of a new policy on transition between child and adult disability services.  ""We have also appointed a specialist nurse who will work with children from the age of 14 who are moving to adult services,"" it added. ""We fully accept that transitioning from children's services to adult services can create a great deal of anxiety for our young patients and their families, and we are determined to ensure that proper processes are followed at all times.

The agency said on Tuesday only one hospital in the north is capable of treating patients. Some of the fighting is around hospitals, where patients, newborns and medics are stranded with no electricity and dwindling supplies. Israel has ordered civilians to evacuate from Gaza City and surrounding areas in the north, but the southern part of the besieged territory is not much safer. Israel carries out frequent air raids throughout Gaza, hitting what it says are Hamas targets but often killing women and children.

"ETMarkets.com India presents a promising growth story and, ideally, a sustainable one, but the inflow of investments may not match the scale witnessed in China, said  Krishna Memani, chief investment officer   at Pennsylvania- based   Lafayette College's endowment fund . In an interview with  Rajesh Mascarenhas , the seasoned money manager said sectors like healthcare and technology can deliver exceptional growth. Edited excerpts: What is your evaluation of India and where does it fit in your portfolio allocation? India's economic growth will be decent, perhaps not as turbocharged as it has been over the last few years. But it will still be the world's largest or fastest growing economy by a wide metric. Although India is an expensive market, foreign investors may have to accept this reality to participate in its growth potential, hoping that growth justifies the high valuation. However, Indian stakeholders must remain cautious. While India presents a promising growth story and, ideally, a sustainable one, the inflow of investments may not match the scale witnessed in China. Therefore, expectations should not outpace the capital allocation process. India is attracting attention from global fund managers alongside Brazil, albeit for different reasons, making them the focal point in the emerging market landscape. Unlock Leadership Excellence with a Range of CXO Courses Offering College Course Website IIM Lucknow IIML Chief Operations Officer Programme Visit Indian School of Business ISB Chief Technology Officer Visit IIM Lucknow IIML Chief Marketing Officer Programme Visit What are the potential risks for global investors in India? One significant risk is the potential change in the growth outlook. Additionally, India's unstable currency, which has been a long-standing drag, and rising oil prices could negatively impact the currency and the current account situation, thereby impeding domestic growth. These macro risks are more pressing concerns for India. What are your views on the valuation of Indian stocks? Indian markets, though relatively expensive globally, are expected to maintain consistent investment flows due to promising growth prospects and  FDI  dynamics. While inflows will persist, they may not be as rapid as in cheaper markets. The valuation landscape in India is primarily influenced by domestic factors, such as the shift of investors from real estate to stocks, which is still in its early stages. This trend will likely continue and provide valuation support independent of foreign investors. What are your views on Indian mid- and small-cap stocks? In relative terms, Indian small- and mid-cap stocks appear to be overvalued. Although valuations for these stocks in India might have adjusted somewhat, they haven't corrected sufficiently compared to the rest of the world. Nevertheless, they do offer better value when compared to large-cap stocks. How will higher US bond yields impact emerging markets like India? The elevated yields in the US do not bode well for India, especially concerning their influence on global interest rates. The resurgence of bonds as a significant asset class offers an alternative for foreign investors. However, the consequences of this shift will have a more pronounced impact on slower-growing emerging markets rather than a country like India. While India won't be immune to these effects, I anticipate that its domestic factors will eventually offset any potential repercussions they might have had.   How are global fund managers looking at India for now? Surprisingly, India, not China, has been the principal catalyst for foreign investment in India, encompassing portfolio investments and direct investments. When viewed from the perspective of US institutional investors, the preference is to invest in rapidly growing markets with lower susceptibility to political and geopolitical disruptions. This preference is a key driver behind the inflow of funds into India. Which are the investment themes you like in India? We're willing to embrace emerging market risk to access growth opportunities. Therefore, investing in large-cap domestic banks may not align with this strategy. We prioritise sectors with significantly better growth prospects or exceptionally attractive valuations relative to large-cap alternatives such as healthcare and technology, which can deliver exceptional growth. While e-commerce is growing, its valuations may not align with future earnings potential. Instead, we favour companies that can integrate technology and digitisation into their existing business models, potentially leading to improved margins and growth.

"a french armed robber who staged a spectacular jailbreak by helicopter has been handed an extra 14 years behind bars by a paris court. rédoine faïd drew inspiration for his criminal career from french and american gangster films. he was eventually caught after his dramatic 2018 escape from réau prison in the southern paris outskirts. two brothers, three nephews and a convicted member of the corsican underworld were also in the dock. the break-out was faïd's second successful humiliation of the french prison system. in april 2013 he used smuggled explosives and a gun to spring himself from sequedin prison in the north, before being recaptured the next month. on 1 july 2018 three armed accomplices commandeered a helicopter and ordered its pilot to land in a courtyard inside réau jail. after they let off smoke bombs to confuse guards, one of the men - identified as faïd's elder brother rachid - used a disc-grinder to cut through doors leading to the visiting room. faïd was at that moment receiving a visit from another brother, brahim. inmates of the prison cheered as the helicopter took off with its new passenger. the whole operation took less than 10 minutes. this time faïd spent three months on the run. but police eventually traced him to his home town of creil, north of paris, where he was seen moving around dressed as a woman in a muslim burqa. for faïd, who was once described in a police profile as a ""social predator"" and a ""gifted manipulator"", the seven-week trial was a rare chance - after years in solitary confinement - to perform before a jury and present a romanticised version of his criminal past.  on his first appearance in the special courtroom, the same used in recent terrorist trials, he joked that he had put on running shoes for the occasion: ""because you never know. the light goes out, and then when it goes on again, puff - i'm gone!"" he said it was boredom and the prospect of another 20 years in jail that pushed him into planning the break-out, whose mechanism he based on previous celebrated french escapes. his flash of inspiration came when he saw the authorities had made the ""incredible lapse"" of not using anti-helicopter nets above the courtyard.  ""i'm in a concrete sarcophagus 23 hours out of 24… what am i going to do? kick my heels indefinitely?"" he asked the court. ""i have an addiction which consumes me and which i cannot cure. i am addicted to freedom."" describing the moment he entered the prison courtyard, he said he ""took the sun full in the face, like a first taste of freedom... it was indescribable. a confinement that suddenly opens to the four winds, to space, to the infinite"". prosecution lawyers warned the jury not to be won over by the accused's personality and charm - nor by his version of events, according to which the escape was planned with a group of ""professionals"" who he refused to name. in fact, according to the prosecution, the break-out was a purely family affair, faïd's links with organised crime having been severed by his too-obvious love of the limelight.  during a brief period of ""going straight"" in the early 2010s, faïd co-authored a book about his criminal past, and made regular appearances on national television. born to algerian parents, the 10th of 11 children, faïd robbed his first bank in 1990. he became an expert in attacking armoured vans, and his first conviction was in 1998.  claiming to be inspired by hollywood films such as heat, he boasted that he followed a criminal code of honour and never hurt his victims. however in 2010 a policewoman was shot dead during a chase following a robbery which he organized. the court convicted his elder brother rachid, 65, for organising the helicopter flight. he was sentenced to 10 years in jail. one of the nephews was also on board the helicopter, and a second was on standby with getaway vehicles. faïd's brother brahim, who claimed he knew nothing of the plot, was given a one-year suspended prison sentence.  a subplot in the trial concerned a corsican mafia connection. allegedly jacques mariani, a convicted underworld boss, was contacted by faïd via an intermediary, with an offer to ""deal with"" gangland rivals if mariani would organise an escape.    both men told the court that the story was untrue. the only evidence came from the alleged intermediary, who testified from behind a screen and now lives under a new identity in a foreign country. there was consternation in court earlier this month when due to a technical mishap the man's face was broadcast accidentally in the spectators' gallery. a photograph was taken and then shown on social media, but the culprit was never identified.","Rédoine faïd drew inspiration for his criminal career from french and american gangster films.

"It took just under a year for Sam Bankman-Fried to go from crypto wunderkind toconvicted felon. No one is happier about that than the professionals in the industry that made him, for a time, a rock star. When Bankman-Fried’s crypto empirecollapsedlast November, it sent the fledgling industry back years. For the crypto faithful who are still standing and striving, the trial couldn’t be over soon enough. “With the trial’s conclusion, the crypto community can start to turn the page on this unfortunate chapter,” said Bobby Zagotta, US CEO of Bitstamp, a European-based exchange. “SBF … does not define the crypto sector or what we aim to achieve.” For much of the past year, crypto has been struggling to crawl out from FTX’s shadow, and there’s no shortage of schadenfreude going around now that Bankman-Fried is facing a prison sentence. “A lot of folks in the crypto industry are delighted,” said Yesha Yadav, a law professor and associate dean at Vanderbilt University. “I think they’re very happy to see SBF and FTX punished in the harshest possible terms.” But shaking crypto’s association with bad actors is a lot easier said than done, even as large institutional investors like BlackRock and Fidelity are lining up to get in onbitcoin funds. “The crypto industry as a whole will celebrate and call for a ‘back to business’ attitude in light of the verdict,” said Kurt Wuckert Jr., CoinGeek’s chief bitcoin historian. “But this ignores bigger, systemic problems that exist in the industry.” When the exchange collapsed, it set off acontagionin crypto and deepened a sustained selloff that saw the industry shed $2 trillion in value in 2022. Several firms that were exposed to FTX filed for bankruptcy or were forced to halt withdrawals. Regulators swooped in with lawsuits accusing some of the biggest names in the business, such as Coinbase and Binance, of selling unregistered securities. FTX customers whose deposits evaporated are still waiting in limbo to see whether they’ll be made whole. The memory of Bankman-Fried won’t be easily erased. The fraud he was convicted of organizing is among the biggest in US history, earning him a spot in the grifter hall of famealongside Bernie MadoffandElizabeth Holmes. And the conviction is hardly the end of his legal battle. A second trial on five additional charges, including alleged campaign-finance violations and bribery of foreign officials, is scheduled for March, and it’s up to the Justice Department to decide whether it will still pursue that case. Bankman-Fried’s lawyers vowed to keep fighting to prove his innocence, setting the stage for an appeal. Beyond FTX and Bankman-Fried, crypto is still locked in aregulatory tusslewith the Securities and Exchange Commission and its leader, Gary Gensler, who has staked out an openly hostile position toward digital assets. “There’s definitely an element of ‘ding-dong the witch is dead,’” said Eric Soufer, a political adviser to major crypto companies, referring to Bankman-Fried’s conviction. “But in crypto … the bogeyman is still Gary Gensler and the SEC, and I don’t think this case fundamentally changes that dynamic.”","Sam Bankman-Fried's crypto empire collapsed last November.

"David Berglas, one of the most influential magicians and mentalists of the 20th Century, has died aged 97. The Magic Circle, seen as the most famous magic society in the world, confirmed Berglas died in London on Friday night. Also known as the International Man of Mystery, he was the first magician to have his own programme on British TV, Meet David Berglas, in 1954. His son Marvin said he was a ""giant in the magic fraternity"". In the 1980s Berglas had a second television series - called The Mind of David Berglas - where he entertained celebrities, including Omar Sharif, Christopher Lee and Britt Ekland. Throughout the decades, he appeared frequently on British TV and radio and became a household name for his stunts, one of which included driving a car around London while blindfolded. Berglas was renowned for a trick called the Berglas Effect, with which he could find a spectator's chosen card at any number in a deck of cards. It is regarded as the holy grail of magic effects, the secret of which he took to the grave. The magician was born to Jewish-German parents who fled the country when the Nazis took power in the 1930s.  After the war, when he was involved with US military intelligence, he ended up in Bradford where he studied textiles, according to the Jewish Bradford heritage group. Mr Berglas was appointed MBE in 2018 for his services to magic and psychology. He said at the time: ""I am delighted to accept this honour but even more pleased that the art of magic has at last been recognised. ""I have spent over 60 years entertaining people in person, on radio and television - 'reading their minds' - but I certainly didn't see this one coming."" His son Marvin said: ""My father was a giant in the magic fraternity, known for his originality, creativity and showmanship. ""His mysteries have not only baffled audiences but also his peers. However, to us, his family, he will always be best remembered as a loving husband, father and grandfather."" Illusionist Derren Brown hailed Berglas as ""one of our greatest living magical performers"" when Berglas was awarded his MBE. ""Generations of magicians owe him a debt of gratitude,"" Brown said. ""Each of my shows is indebted to his artistry and astonishing body of work. I thank him for his constant inspiration.""

"EXCLUSIVE:ArtsEdfaced a routine external inspection by the UK’s education regulator within days of Deadline publishing allegations of bullying and misconduct at the esteemed drama school. ArtsEd – which countsAndrew Lloyd Webberas its president — was told in May to expect the Ofsted review around this time of year, but the precise date of an inspection is not revealed until the school day before a probe begins. Inspectors entered ArtsEd’s higher education faculties earlier this week, soon afterDeadline reported on concernsabout the conduct of the institution’s principal, Julie Spencer.Related StoriesNewsInvestigation: Andrew Lloyd Webber-Backed Drama School ArtsEd Defends Culture Amid Allegations Of Bullying, Misconduct & ToxicityNewsDrama Schools Uncovered: Student Says College That Made Gary Oldman A Star Failed To Protect Her From A Classmate She Accused Of Sexual Assault An ArtsEd source said the inspection was “categorically” not linked to the allegations, but Deadline understands that Ofsted was aware of the story before entering. The regulator declined to comment. ArtsEd was last inspected by Ofsted in 2015 when it was awarded an “outstanding” status by the regulator — the highest grade a school can achieve. Ofsted invites employees to complete anonymous surveys during inspections and a source said some staff members had taken the opportunity to communicate concerns about the school’s leadership. “A lot of what inspections are about is leadership and how the business side of schools work,” an ArtsEd insider said. Deadline’s investigation revealed considerable anxiety about the leadership style of principal Spencer. Twenty people who have had personal interactions with Spencer accused her of being an erratic and occasionally intimidating individual. The majority of those who spoke to Deadline said they considered her behavior to be bullying. Students told Deadline that she created a “culture of fear” and was capable of bizarre outbursts, including one in which she accused a year group of being “snakes.” At least two ex-staffers accused Spencer of intimidating behavior, while others blamed ArtsEd for a deterioration in their mental health. A well-placed former employee said there were a number of complaints to HR about Spencer’s alleged conduct, but people were reluctant to put concerns in writing for fear of being punished or losing their jobs. ArtsEd rejected accusations of misconduct and bullying leveled at Spencer and strongly denied that it has a “toxic” culture that has impacted the wellbeing of students. It said Spencer was responsible for a major overhaul of the school’s processes, which had been necessary, if not always popular with long-serving employees. Since publication, Deadline has been contacted by more than 50 people who have described their own experience at the school, as well as at Spencer’s previous employer, St Mary’s University. Others shared Deadline’s story on X, formerly known as Twitter. Arysha Kelly, a 2021 ArtsEd graduate, said: “It’s just horrifying reading through the other hundreds of stories that happened to so many people. Everyone deserved much better.” ArtsEd has been unmoved by the backlash and continues to stand by Spencer. It has argued that many of the allegations refer to conduct that took place before a lawyer-led inquiry into ArtsEd’s culture in 2021, even though the majority of those who spoke to Deadline did not give evidence to the independent investigation. In a staff email last week, school leaders said the story was not justified and was “in no way reflective of the facts.” The email continued: “We understand that the article will have come as a shock to many of you. However, it is important to point out … that we strongly reject the allegations.” One senior employee said the email “wound me up so much,” while other insiders said the school was in a state of denial that they did not consider to be sustainable. “ArtsEd has been riddled with scandal [in the past] … but this is the worst version of the place there has ever been,” said the senior employee. Annemarie Lewis Thomas, the former principal of London’s Musical Theatre Academy and an industry advocate for student safety, said on X that ArtsEd had its “head down” in the hope the “crisis will pass.” Also on X, Steven Kavuma, a former ArtsEd teacher who spoke out about student safety as part of Deadline’s investigation, said: “Still nothing from ArtsEd… They have not created an anonymous reporting system where past/present students and staff can come forward. They have not started a formal investigation. The board needs to prioritise the safety & well-being of students & staff.” The school declined to answer questions about whether it had received further complaints but said it would always listen to those who speak out, pointing to its complaints and whistleblowing procedures. An ArtsEd spokesperson said: “We will always encourage anybody, including students, alumni and staff, to speak up and report any allegations of misconduct. “We have a clear complaints procedure in place, including a whistleblowing policy, and ensure that every complaint that we receive is thoroughly investigated and recorded. Where complaints are upheld, appropriate action is taken. We are unequivocal in the belief that people should be empowered to speak out, and they will always be listened to by us.” Previously, the school told Deadline: “The school’s leadership has been working to proactively improve our culture and processes. We have made many robust changes that were needed in light of those findings, including staff departures and instilling a new and more student-focused culture. “Although this work is ongoing and we recognise that there is always room for evolving and building on the improvements that have been made, we are confident that the school today is a much more accountable and supportive environment than two years ago.” A representative for Lloyd Webber declined to comment on Deadline’s investigation last week. There is no suggestion that he was aware of the allegations.

"Jessica Kriegel, Chief Scientist of Workplace Culture, Culture Partners.   A changing workforce. A challenging economy. These are simply two of the many obstacles that corporate leaders must navigate to grow their companies. When developing strategies to thrive in the post-pandemic business climate, members of the C-suite often overlook one important aspect that can serve as a compass to stay on the track to success: culture. Many leaders see culture as an intangible element of the workplace. Nothing is further from the truth if culture is implemented properly. And I have the statistics to prove it. Operationalized Versus Memorialized Cultures To create success, your corporate culture needs to connect purpose and strategy. To determine if your culture does that, ask one key question: ""Is it operationalized or memorialized?"" The answer will be the difference between retaining or losing quality talent, increasing or decreasing productivity and a corporate balance sheet that is black or red. A memorialized culture is one that is set in stone. It never changes, even as the company evolves. Invariably, there is misalignment between the company’s culture and its purpose. Employee motivation and retention wanes, and productivity stagnates. Conversely, an operationalized culture is a powerful tool at leadership’s disposal that can change as needed. Operationalizing a culture brings about a vibrant, focused vision through alignment with purpose and strategy—invigorating employees and managers to achieve a common goal. How To Operationalize Your Culture To operationalize culture at scale, leaders need to be able to adapt culture when necessary to achieve the desired results. But this is about more than adapting culture on a whim. Truly successful companies pivot to the right culture at the right time after evaluating results in the context of ongoing changes. Company management can determine if they have the desired operational culture by answering ""yes"" to all three of these questions: • Does my company have systems in place that allow my culture to assess progress and adjust to changing business strategies and needs? • Are there established processes so the company culture advances from ideas to experiences? Communication and transparency are key to these processes. Management must convey strategy and desired results to team members, as well as the role each person plays in achieving those results. • Have frameworks been established to help everyone recognize how culture impacts business results? Operationalized Culture = Revenue An operationalized culture—one that's been built into a clear process and framework—has the ability to adapt and scale. By doing so, companies are poised for success. Research conducted by my company in collaboration with Stanford University found adaptiveness to be a statistically significant cultural dimension that positively affects revenue growth. According to the research findings, adaptive cultures (another word for operationalized cultures) increased revenue by nearly 50% while non-adaptive cultures (a.k.a. memorialized cultures) only grew revenues by 17%. In other words, companies with an adaptive culture experienced 192% greater revenue growth than those unable to adapt to changes. Avoid Being Caught In The Action Trap A key aspect of a successful operationalized culture is to pivot at the right time. Adjustments need to be based on internal factors and established goals, not external variables that may lead to new cultures based on a whim. If the latter approach is taken, a company gets caught in what we at my company call ""the action trap."" When this occurs, leaders institute a continual cycle of implementing new processes and systems to change results rather than addressing the underlying experiences leading to those results. We’ve all seen how ""the action trap"" can lead to disaster: Large brands attempt to align with societal trends with little regard for whether they fit the company’s goals and current culture. The end result of this misalignment is that employees feel a disconnect with the company, productivity suffers, customers become disgruntled and sales and revenue drop. An operationalized culture adjusts based on how the company evolves. For example, a startup company can be much more flexible in its business approach and work schedules in the early years. As it grows and becomes more established, structured processes and procedures need to be put in place. Another example of an effective operationalized culture is an automobile manufacturer rolling out EVs. To align with the company expansion, the culture should support and encourage employees to participate in environmental programs and the manufacturer can institute initiatives to reduce its carbon footprint. Conclusion Success in today’s market economy requires leaders to take a closer look at culture. They need to take accountability for aligning purpose, strategy and culture so their organizations will be positioned to readily adapt. In such a workplace, employees will understand the ""why"" behind their work, even as they adjust to new changes. That’s what empowers employees to do their best work, for company goals to be met and for growth to be achieved.

"Xavi's job might be safe for the meantime at FC Barcelona.  FC Barcelona head coach Xavi Hernandez and his players must have breathed a huge collective sigh of relief when the full time whistle on their comeback win against Porto in the Champions League was blown on Tuesday night. Sealed by goals from the two Joaos, Cancelo and Felix, the 2-1 victory guaranteed that Barca will qualify for the knockout phase in Europe's elite competition for the first time since 2021 whether that is as the winners of Group H or runners-up. As indicated by UEFA figures and a report from Mundo Deportivo, beating Porto will replenish Barca's battered coffers with much needed prize money and there could be more to come if the Catalans top Royal Antwerp in their final group game then advance to the quarter finals in March. The key development also bought Xavi time - a valuable commodity that was beginning to run out for the club legend in the manager's hotseat. Though he brought a maiden La Liga crown to Camp Nou for the first time in four years this spring, the former number 6 had a black cloud hanging over him for overseeing back-to-back failures to reach the business end of the Champions League. When Barca were turfed out of the tournament and thrust into the inferior Europa League, he wasn't able to steer his men to the trophy as consolation in two separate sittings either with Eintracht Frankfurt and Manchester United delivering respective hammer blows in 2022 and 2023. Whether Barca can retain the Spanish championship this season or not, Xavi would ultimately be judged on avoiding making it three times unlucky in Europe. Recent losses to Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk triggered doubts from some about his suitability for one of football's most demanding roles, and he wasn't naive enough to believe that his job is now safe because of this week's exploits. ""Problems are never solved at Barca,"" Xavi noted with a laugh in a post-match interview with Movistar, before insisting that the focus should be on congratulating the club and team for their achievements above all without looking beyond the here and now. Xavi knows that there are difficult domestic ties coming up against Atletico Madrid and Girona at the top of the table this week and next. And if Barca don't come out of those meetings to the satisfaction of the all-powerful entorno, or environment, that surrounds the Blaugrana, he will again be taken to task. Though he has a little breathing space for now, Xavi will, like most managers at top outfits, be evaluated in the spring. Barca aren't expected to win the UCL, but at least going out on their shield in the quarter-finals or semi-finals, and mounting a reasonable La Liga title defense, could guarantee him another term in the hotseat.","FC Barcelona beat Porto 2-1 in the Champions League on Tuesday night.

"ANI Living under constant fear of  shelling by Pakistan , villagers of forward  Trava village  in this sector of Jammu district are pushing for their long-standing demand of a bridge near the International Border to move to safer places. The residents are currently using a makeshift structure of cement sewage pipes to cross a stream and want a permanent bridge for safe evacuation in case of cross-border firing.  A  BSF jawan  was killed in firing by  Pakistan Rangers  in Ramgarh sector of Samba district during the intervening night of November 8-9. This was the first loss of life on this side after renewed ceasefire was agreed upon by the two countries on February 25, 2021.  Earlier, two BSF personnel and a woman were injured in cross-border firing in Arnia sector on October 26, while another BSF jawan was injured in a similar incident on October 17, causing panic among the border residents.  ""The bridge to connect over 20 villages is a long standing demand of the border resients. I have raised the issue with the administration in 2019 but all our pleas have gone unanswered so far,"" sarpanch Trava Balbir Kour told PTI.  She said the bridge is being proposed at an area beyond Pakistani shelling range.  ""In case of Pakistani shelling, the vulnerable people can use the bridge to reach safer places,"" Kour said, adding after her representation to the administration, took two years were consumed by the Covid pandemic and later a detailed project report was prepared by the Public Works Department.  Following heavy firing and shelling by Pakistan on October 26, the sarpanch said the villagers met the visiting official team led by Divisional Commissioner Ramesh Kumar and raised the demand for the construction of the bridge on priority.  ""I have heard that the Rural Development Department has been assigned the construction of the bridge and the work is likely to start in the coming days,"" Kour hoped.  Atma Ram, a villager, said the local panchayat used to carry out necessary repairs of the makeshift bridge every time after the monsoon season.  ""After the recent firing incidents from across the border, the situation has changed altogether and people want this bridge to be completed as soon as possible,"" he said.  Echoing Ram, another villager Ramesh Kumar said the bridge when constructed will prove as a lifeline for the border residents.

"Now that the sun is setting so early that you want to put your pj’s on at 4 pm and the weather is so cold that not even watching Beckham on Netflix can heat you up enough, it’s time to break out the recipe for a good old fashioned hot toddy. A Hot Toddy will help get you through those cold winter nights. What is a Hot Toddy? A hot toddy is a drink made of liquor, water, lemon, honey and spices. It is served hot, usually on a cold or wet night, and has been used to relieve cold or flu symptoms. While there’s no scientific evidence that hot booze can clear up the common cold, having this toasty beverage when you’re under the weather will most likely make you feel better! But you don’t need to wait until you’re sick to mix up a hot toddy. Most people use whiskey, bourbon or brandy but you can experiment with using different liquors and spices. Customize your hot toddy depending on your preferences or mood. How to Make a Hot Toddy To make a hot toddy, you just need a few simple ingredients that you probably already have on hand including lemon, honey and some brown liquor. Some popular liquor choices for a hot toddy are Maker’s Mark, Monkey Shoulder or Woodford Reserve. Most recently, I used Sourland Mountain Straight Bourbon Whiskey in my hot toddy and it had delicious, warming notes of vanilla, clover, star anise and black pepper. Ingredients: 1 1/2 oz. whiskey or bourbon 1 cup hot water 1 tbsp honey 1/2 oz. lemon juice (freshly squeezed) Cinnamon stick, lemon wedge or star anise for garnish Method: Combine all of the ingredients together in a mug and garnish to your liking. Sip and enjoy! Variations on a Classic There are plenty of ways to switch up your hot toddy and one of them is by trying a different liquor. You can experiment with the flavors of aged rum, brandy or even the smoky taste of mezcal. Some people even add saké along with their whiskey to this drink. You can also change up the spices in your hot toddy. Try adding a few cloves, or my favorite, a slice of raw ginger, for a bold taste. You can even try using maple syrup in place of the honey. If this is your first time having a hot toddy, you’ll immediately notice the warming, spicy flavor upon your first sip. Whether you’re drinking it to relieve cold symptoms or just to warm up on a cold night, you can’t go wrong with this drink. Experiment to find the variation you like best. Spring may be far away but there’s plenty to feel warm and toasty about with a log on the fireplace and a hot toddy in hand.","A Hot Toddy is a drink made of liquor, water, lemon, honey and spices.

"PM Albanese calls for 'unimpeded trade' in China amid rights controversies at home. By Chris Taylor for RFA 2023.11.07 -- Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese wrapped up a three-day trip to China Tuesday, calling for the ""full resumption of free and unimpeded trade"" in a meeting with counterpart Li Qiang. The previous day, he held wide-ranging talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping, covering everything from Tasmanian Devils to New Zealand wine, not to mention improving relations with Australia's largest two-way trading partner in goods and services. In the next step toward mending the previously fraught relations and stabilizing them, Albanese told reporters in Beijing on Tuesday that both sides have agreed on practical steps to advance dialogue in areas of common interests, including climate change, trade and people-to-people links. He also said he raised the plight of detained Australian writer Yang Hengjun - although he provided no details about his possible release - and human rights issues within China, in a move that highlighted the controversial nature of the trip in Australia. It was the first visit to China by an Australian prime minister since 2016, with the two sides visibly making an effort to reframe a relationship marred by disputes on trade, human rights and the COVID-19 pandemic during the tenure of the previous prime minister Scott Morrison. ""It is wise for Labor to 'stabilize' the relationship with China,"" Han Yang, a former Chinese diplomat turned political commentator, told Radio Free Asia. Albanese has been the leader of the Labor Party since 2019. ""Australia is a middle power. It's not in Australia's interest to pick a quarrel with China, a superpower and its largest trading partner. 'Cooperate where we can and disagree where we must' is the right mantra to approach the relationship,"" Yang said. Chinese misjudgment? Yang pointed out that Canberra did not make major strategic concessions, nor was it simply acting on the orders of the United States as some pro-China activists have argued. ""It's worth noting that Australia didn't concede on any national security strategic goals. AUKUS is pushing on,"" he said, referring to the trilateral security partnership between Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States in the Indo-Pacific region. Australia's ban on Huawei remains, as does its anti-foreign interference law. ""What has changed is the tone, and China got the message. ""That is why it welcomed Albo with a red carpet,"" Yang said, referring to the Australian prime minister's nickname. ""If you look at the foreign ministry read out, it gives significantly more space to Xi's speech compared to meetings with other second-tier power world leaders."" Another China watcher Gerry Groot, senior lecturer in Chinese Studies at the University of Adelaide, told RFA that whatever transpired from Albanese's meetings with the Chinese leaders was driven more by Australia's own policy than American interests. ""It's Chinese actions and demands in the South China Sea and South Pacific - Australia's own backyard - which are so alarming to Australian politicians and defense planners,"" Groot said. He said he believed that Chinese strategic analysts had miscalculated the effect of weaponizing economic relations with Australia to drive a wedge between the U.S. and Australia or force more concessions, as well as punish the previous Morrison government for its anti-China stance. ""The grudging concessions on some of these sanctions have come about because the cost to China's reputation internationally was greater than anticipated and the impact on Australia in economic terms was less, while at the same time driving relations with America closer,"" he said. Exiles push back Australia's relationship with China is made more complex by the fact that it is home to probably tens of thousands of exiles from China who have fled due to human rights violations, ethnic or religious oppression, or personal safety. ""I think Albo's China visit is morally corrupt, economically miscalculated and contradictory to Australia's national security interests,"" exiled Chinese artist Badiucao told RFA. ""Morally it is unacceptable to keep doing business as normal with a regime like China amid ongoing genocide against millions of Uyghurs and [while it is] supporting Russia's invasion in multiple ways."" He later posted on X, formerly known as Twitter, that the visit will one day ""be remembered as appeasement like 1938."" Also on X, Uyghur Australian activist Intizar Ilham wrote that bringing a delegation of 400 business leaders on the trip was ""an insult to the human dignity"" of Uyghurs and Tibetans. Badiucao pointed out to RFA that Australian citizen Yang Hengjun, a writer who was detained in 2019 while visiting family, is still in jail ""as a political hostage"" in China."" Some Uyghurs and Tibetans living in Australia, such as Ramila Chanisheff, president of the Australian Uyghur Tangritagh Women's Association, reject any deals with the ""devil."" Chanisheff told RFA that she and Tibetan representatives had petitioned against Albanese's visit to China in Canberra ahead of the trip. ""I think it was when we learned that Albanese was taking 400 trade reps [representatives] to China that it hit us the hardest. One Tibetan colleague of mine said she found it triggering,"" she said. ""Of course, as Australians, we feel shame at what happened to indigenous Australian youth, forced education etc, but now we're facilitating a massive state that is doing the same in East Turkestan and Tibet."" Groot added, ""While PM Albanese is beaming in his photos with CCP General Secretary Xi, we can only hope it is because the Chinese side has decided that more concessions to Australia are needed and perhaps that Yang Hengjun will be released shortly, rather than the grandeur of the occasion."" ""In the meantime,"" he added. ""Gordon Ng [an Australian citizen charged with subversion] languishes in a Hong Kong jail on trumped up retrospective charges also.""

"HONG KONG: HSBC is on track to meet a target of expanding its China wealth business headcount to 3,000 by 2025, despite the country's current economic headwinds, as it bets on a steadily rising number of the extremely affluent, a senior executive said. The Asia-focused bank has recruited around 1,500 wealth managers in the world's second-largest economy since 2011, Trista Sun, HSBC China head of wealth and personal banking, told Reuters. The expansion of the China wealth advisory team serves HSBC's digital-focused ""Pinnacle"" strategy, part of a pivot towards Asia with $3.5 billion worth of investments committed to the region in 2021. The growing headcount is in addition to wealth advisory staff in HSBC's Chinese branches, Sun said. Most foreign banks still rely on in-branch wealth planners to serve clients in China. HSBC is pressing ahead with the hiring plan as China's wealth and insurance sector is expanding faster than the country's economy is expected to, she added. The bank estimates that China's household wealth will increase by around 8.5% a year over a five-year period starting 2022, outpacing Beijing's around-5% annual target for 2023 economic growth which many fear will be a struggle to reach. Under Pinnacle, HSBC runs an insurance brokerage unit which in September became the first qualified foreign-owned broker to distribute mutual funds locally. The bank's targeted wealth clientele - adults with a net worth of at least $250,000 - is expected to double to 350 million by 2030 in China, the bank estimates. A weaker Chinese yuan has bolstered demand for offshore investment options, with Sun pointing to the quota-based Qualified Domestic Institutional Investors programme (QDII) and Wealth Management Connect scheme covering China's wealthy Greater Bay Area as investors seek ""exposure to the international market"". The London-headquartered bank has expanded its QDII offer with the acquisition of Citigroup's China consumer wealth management business in October this year, Sun said.","HSBC is on track to meet a target of expanding its China wealth business headcount to 3,000 by 2025.

"there's something eerie about this forest in the southern sierra nevada. tangles of bony branches obscure the ground. dead trees stand gray and bristly. an aura of doom hangs over the green conifers that remain.the expanse of sierra national forest near shaver lake is a relic of the climate before global warming. scientists believe that the conifers won't be able to survive the current conditions. researchers at stanford university found in a recent study that roughly one-fifth of all conifer forests in the sierra are mismatched with the warmer climate and have become ""zombie forests.""""the name 'zombie forest' is kind of kitschy, but i've come to find that it is haunting,"" said ecologist avery hill, who co-wrote the study while pursuing a doctorate at stanford.hill combed his way through a thicket one afternoon and paused at a clearing overlooking a valley, its pine-studded slopes dotted with boulders ringed by patches of shrubby chaparral.""that's what we think will spread out and eventually cover this whole area,"" he said.the findings indicate that these lower-elevation sierra conifer forests, which include ponderosa pine, sugar pine and douglas fir, are no longer able to successfully reproduce. conditions have become too warm and dry to support conifer saplings, whose shallow roots require plenty of water if they are to survive into adulthood, hill said. giant sequoias also grow in lower-elevation areas of the sierra nevada, but the researchers didn't analyze the risks specific to those trees.when these forests burn in high-severity wildfires—or are wiped out by drought, disease or pests—they will likely be replaced by other types of trees and brush, the scientists said. that could dramatically slash how much carbon the region can store; provide a habitat for invasive species; and displace plants and animals that call the forests home.knowing exactly where such changes might take place can help land managers prioritize where to resist the changes and where to accept or even accelerate them.""it provides almost an experimental space to address some really difficult questions about how we manage ecological transitions,"" said hill, who now works at the california academy of sciences.hill started his doctoral program knowing he wanted to study how human activity affects forests. then the nuns fire burned through the redwood forests of napa, threatening his family home and destroying a shed. to hill, it was a clear instance of the confluence of wildfire and climate change, leading him to focus on those topics.zombie forests can persist for a long time without a disturbance to shake them up, hill said, but research showed that many of the forests are headed for inevitable transitions with the 2.2 degrees of warming that has already occurred in the sierra.these rapidly changing landscapes could have major implications for how california manages wildfire.different types of forest burn in different ways, and knowing what will grow where could help authorities plan for fires, hill said. for instance, chaparral historically supports catastrophic fire on average every 40 to 50 years, versus every 150 to 200 years for conifer forests, he said.""so maybe around communities, you'd prefer to have a well-managed conifer forest,"" he said.to determine which areas of forest are mismatched with thewarmer climate, the scientists examined detailed vegetation data from a u.s. forest service survey done in the 1930s. from that, they created a computer model to analyze habitat suitability, and found that while the average elevation of conifer forests has shifted upslope about 110 feet, the temperatures most suitable for the trees have retreated farther up the mountains, about 600 feet on average.they crafted a map of the sierra splotched with pink—which shows where the forests are outside of the climate where they thrive—and red—where the mismatch is severe.while much of modern-day ecology is focused on understanding transitions by examining those that have already occurred, this map shows where changes are likely to take place, hill said.""so we can start monitoring them and observing these transitions before they even start, and even start thinking about proactive management in these areas,"" he said.he described the study as a jumping-off point for more research, including whether wildfires burn differently in zombie forests and how that knowledge might be integrated into fire behavior modeling.sarah campe, regional scientist with the sierra nevada conservancy, said she found the research thought-provoking. it added to an ongoing conversation about what the forests of the future will look like, she said. still, she tends to view studies about landscapes' response to climate change with some skepticism.""these landscapes are incredibly complex,"" she said. ""i just don't think our models are there yet to actually be able to understand exactly what will happen.""climate is just one driver of change affecting these ecosystems, campe pointed out. more than a century ago, colonizers outlawed cultural burns by indigenous groups and adopted aggressive fire-suppression policies, and later managed swaths of the region for timber.these practices deprived the sierra's forests of the regular low-intensity fires to which they'd adapted, and resulted in the removal of the largest, most fire-resistant conifers. many of these areas are now overcrowded with younger trees that burn more easily.""that has altered the structure and composition of these forests and made them vulnerable to wildfires, to drought and to warmer temperatures,"" she said. ""and certainly, climate is a huge and important driver in all of this, but that doesn't mean that there aren't levers that we can be pulling that aren't directly associated with carbon reduction to help protect these forests or restore these ecosystems.""hill agreed, but said the researchers chose to focus primarily on climate because it's the foundational condition that determines whether a tree can grow in a particular place.""there are management decisions you can make to kind of squeeze out every last opportunity these trees have to survive by thinning these forests out or introducing prescribed burns or even seeding different species after logging,"" he said. ""but if the climate says no, the forest won't grow.""his team examined different scenarios of global warming and concluded that if humanity allows climate change to occur at rapid rates, nearly all of the sierra nevada could become unsuitable for conifer forests by the end of the century. they found that even with improved efforts to cut planet-heating emissions from fossil fuels and other sources of greenhouse gases, the sierra zombie forests could still double in size this century. but they said efforts to rapidly address climate change could make a big difference.""it's a really stark reminder of how much climate change has already occurred, and how important it is to make sure that the amount that occurs in the future is as little as possible,"" said chris field, the study's senior author and director of the stanford woods institute for the environment. ""with aggressive efforts to controlclimate change, then we lose more of the sierra, but not all of it.""another nearby patch of land offers a window into what happens to a zombie forest after a disturbance. three years ago, the creek fire razed these slopes, its explosive intensity—which scientists likened to an incendiary bombing attack— stoked by millions ofdead treesthat had been weakened by drought and ravaged by bark beetles.now, blackened spires jut up from the ground as far as the eye can see. oaks have resprouted, but no conifer saplings are yet evident."" if our models are right, this is more likely than anywhere else to come back as something that's not conifer forest,"" hill said as he peered out over the stunning devastation.there are measures land managers could take to plant and nurture conifer seedlings, hill said, but he noted it would come down to resources, asking, ""is it that important for these lower areas to come back as conifer forest?""ron goode, chairman of the north fork mono tribe, said that since the creek fire, the mono winds that typically blew 60 to 70 mph had at times increased to 110 mph. and the snow and rains that fell last winter unleashed major flooding.""there's nothing to hold the snow, nothing to hold the water back,"" he said. ""so it's out there on bare rock, bare land. it's going to melt faster.""still, goode said, reseeding isn't necessary if people steward the land. although the soil might be scorched several inches deep, there are seed pods underneath the burned portion, he said. indigenous people used to poke holes in the earth to allow these seeds to sprout, but forest policies now forbid this, he said.he said that while oaks and chaparral tend to resprout relatively quickly, conifers take three to five years to begin regrowing. so there often needs to be a burn a couple of years after a wildfire to cull the shrubs and give conifers the opportunity to come back.""i always say to my people when i'm working out there that what we do for mother nature is we give her a pedicure, a manicure; we even try to clean her up a little bit,"" he said. ""but she's going to the ball in the springtime; she's going to put on her own dress. when you give her the opportunity, she knows how to dress herself up.""""that's the whole difference between what the native american did with the land and what the european american does to the land—is we put back. we give back,"" he added. ""they don't.""other interventions could include thinning out the trees so there's enough water to go around, and trying to keep catastrophic fire risk low by culling vegetation that could carry flames from the forest floor up into the canopy, field said.""these sierra conifers can live for hundreds and hundreds of years,"" he said. ""and one aspiration of this kind of intervention would be to create a situation where even though the forests are zombies—are not reproducing—we might be able to keep them in place and keep their ecosystem services going for many decades or even centuries.""land managers may in some cases decide that the best approach is to harvest the existing trees and facilitate the recovery of shrubs or oak trees.for example, within the footprint of the 2018 camp fire, there was an area of near-totalforestloss that is unlikely to support dense conifer stands in the future, said campe of the sierra nevada conservancy. several groups, including the butte county resource conservation district, u.s. forest service, konkow valley band of maidu indians and the nonprofit american forests, are facilitating a transition toward an open, oak-dominated woodland.in other places, including recreation areas, tribal cultural sites and habitats that support iconic species likegiant sequoias, it may be worth putting more resources into preserving or restoring the ecosystem, she said.still, campe said, the sierra's land managers—which include government agencies, private landowners, resource conservation districts and tribes—are able to touch just a fraction of the 25-million-acre region due to funding and personnel constraints.""if mother nature is hitting a giant 'reset' button, there's going to be huge parts of the landscapes that we won't be able to impact. that's where acceptance comes into play,"" she said. ""this will not be the same sierra our grandparents knew. but that doesn't mean it won't be a place that we continue to value and enjoy.""2023 los angeles times. distributed by tribune content agency, llc.citation:","About one-fifth of all conifer forests in the sierra are mismatched with the warmer climate and have become ""zombie forests"" The name 'zombie forest' is kind of kitschy, but i've come to terms with it, says one observer.

"Ukrainian soldiers have turned a Soviet-era antiaircraft gun into a fast-moving ground weapon that can kill dozens of Russian soldiers at a time,the Daily Beast reported. The Artillery Battery Unit of Ukraine's 241st Brigade has mounted Soviet-era KS-19 antiaircraft guns onto the back of trucks, so they can be transported into and out of the fighting, the report said. The unit spent three months taking the guns apart and rebuilding them onto a mobile platform, according to the report. The resulting weapon is one that can hit targets spread out up to 328 feet apart, and can kill dozens of soldiers with one blast, the report said. Evegeny Iitvin, a sergeant in the unit, told the Beast that in just three days one of the guns had ""already destroyed 1,000"" Russian soldiers. The KS-19 was first introduced in 1947, a few years after World War II ended,Business Insider's Jake Epstein previously reported. Despite Ukraine's Western allies giving it weapons and ammunition, many of the weapons Ukraine uses against Russia are relics from the Soviet Union. Russia isalso using decades-old equipmentin Ukraine. The 241st Brigade got four KS-19s in March, the Beast reported. It's also equipping the machines with electronic tablets, costing $8,000. The tablets work with a drone and operator to track and target Russian forces, the report said. Iitvin told the outlet that the project also involved purchasing four trucks. The money came from the soldiers themselves, donors, and friends, the report said. Iitvin said Ukraine's government can't afford to give individual units such large sums of money for projects. Ukraine has become increasingly invested in making its own weaponry as its Western allies have delayed providing some weapons and, Ukraine and many experts say, have not given enough to properly push back Russia. Ukraine istrying to ramp up its own production of missiles, drones, and ammunition. Iitvin told the Beast that ""if Biden provided weapons, I would not need these guns."" Ukrainian soldiers have had to lean oncrowdfundingto get drones, night vision goggles, medical supplies, and other items they say are critical to the war effort. Ukraine is alsoworried about donor fatigue from the countries that back it,as well as the impact of other factors like next year'sUS presidential election.","Ukrainian soldiers have turned a Soviet-era antiaircraft gun into a fast-moving ground weapon that can kill dozens of Russian soldiers at a time.

"NEW DELHI: There's a lot of churn happening in the startup ecosystem. Data sourced from market research firm PrivateCircle Researchshowed that as many as 3.6 lakh employees across India's 111 unicorn startups left their jobs during the September 2022-July 2023 period. The data which captures voluntary employee exits as well as layoffs by companies covers employees for whom provident fund (PF) contributions have been made.At the same time though, firms have also hired 3.7 lakh employees, resulting in a net count increase of 15,128 employees.There are two factors at play, according to analysts. While layoffs are definitely leading the exits, the attrition rate at startups have also gone up due to the high workload. ""Several employees are leaving due to increasing stress. At times, some employees are also not able to cope with the work culture of certain firms,"" said an analyst. In fact, only three unicorns - Zerodha, Hike and Zoho had an attrition rate of under 1% during the September 2022-July 2023 period, the data showed. The heart of the country's tech hub Bengaluru's workforce size (only for unicorns) shrunk by more than 40,000 employees during the period (the figure implies net change, which was counted after adjusting for net additions and exits). In absolute terms, Delhi-NCR's unicorns saw the highest exits with 1.8 lakh employees leaving the firms, followed by Bengaluru which saw 1.2 lakh staff leave either due to layoffs or better opportunities. The research firm said that it considered the September 2022-July 2023 period because the number of unicorns remained uniform during the time frame.","As many as 3.6 lakh employees across India's 111 unicorn startups left their jobs during the September 2022-July 2023 period.

"global warming is changing the quality and taste of beer, scientists have warned. a new study reveals that the quantity of european hops, which gives beer its distinctive bitter taste, is declining. hotter, longer and drier summers are predicted to worsen the situation, and could lead to beer becoming more expensive. the authors warned growers to adapt their farming techniques. beer is a staple of european culture - with 8.5 billion pints sold in the uk alone, according to the british beer and pub association.  hops, the flower of the hop plant, are the crucial fourth ingredient in the beer brewing process - alongside water, yeast and malt. they are added before the boiling process to add bitterness, but can also be added afterwards to change the overall flavour.  the boom in the craft beer industry, increasing demand for beers with distinctive strong flavours, has pushed up the use of high-quality hops. but this study, which looked at how the average yield of aroma hops changed between 1971 and 1994 and between 1995 and 2018, found that in some key hop-growing areas, there was a drop of nearly 20% in output.  the scientists, from the czech academy of sciences (cas) and cambridge university, put the reduction in crop down to drier conditions - probably due to climate change - in recent years. martin mozny, co-author of the paper and research scientist at cas, said: ""failure to adapt will jeopardise the profitability of hop growing in some areas. the consequence will be lower production and a higher price for brewers.""  the price of beer has already increased by 13% since the pandemic in 2020, due to an increase in energy costs driven by inflation, and the gas crisis following the invasion of ukraine.  the scientists also found the alpha bitter acids of the hops - which influence the beer flavour - had reduced, due to higher and more extreme temperatures. despite global efforts, greenhouse gas emissions from human activities have continued to increase temperatures. it is expected in the next five-to-seven years, that the crucial 1.5c barrier will be crossed.  the study predicts that the bitter acids will reduce by up to 31% by 2050.  farmers have been working to adapt their growing practices to improve yields, such as moving farms higher up valleys where there is more rainfall, and installing irrigation systems. but the study authors warn that further investment is needed, and say it will be necessary to expand the area used to grow aroma hops by 20%, to compensate for future decline. the research has been published in the journal nature communications.","Hops, the flower of the hop plant, are the crucial fourth ingredient in the beer brewing process - alongside water, yeast and malt. hotter, longer and drier summers are predicted to worsen the situation, and could lead to beer becoming more expensive. beer is a staple of european culture - with 8.5 billion pints sold in the uk alone.","On 18 December 2023, Hops, the flower of the hop plant, are the crucial fourth ingredient in the beer brewing process - alongside water, yeast and malt. hotter, longer and drier summers are predicted to worsen the situation, and could lead to beer becoming more expensive. beer is a staple of european culture - with 8.5 billion pints sold in the uk alone.",,Other,-0.0027894297320591,-0.0044244311680303,-0.0354595309809634,True

We believe India will follow the trajectory that the IT services industry has undertaken over the last 30 years. We firmly believe that because of the demographic advantage, and India's credentials in and around delivering professional services at scale, India will be the engineering, research, and development (ERND) hub for the global manufacturing company. We think India will deliver services to different parts of the world... so we are investing in people and, we are investing in the customers as well. When it comes to aerospace, the group has invested in Air India and procured over $100 billion in aircraft. As far as global aerospace markets are concerned, India's significant influence will provide us with headwinds. The number of aircraft will double in the next 20 years, and much of the demand is going to come from India. India is not only going to be a source of resources and skills but it's going to be an increasingly important market going forward."" About 80% of the solutions that the company provides are for professional services and the remaining 20% is the technology business. Tata Tech is already into automotive, aerospace and heavy industry machinery. What other sectors Tata Technologies aims to focus on when it comes to expansion plans? Will the focus remain the same? The focus will remain the same. We are first and foremost a professional services company and that's where we are primarily focused on investing & growing. In terms of industry focus, we think there is more than enough opportunity in automotive, aerospace, transport & construction heavy machinery. In automotive, farm, highway construction, and mining equipment (opportunity) is there - (as) typically that industry follows the automotive sector and so we have started to see a demand curve in the automotive industry. But we do see associating opportunities in hi-tech and medical equipment. We are working closely with chip manufacturers as well to deliver software-defined vehicle solutions to customers. The relationships and partnerships will provide us with opportunities in other verticals that we will look at seriously in the future.""

They repeated the claims elsewhere as well. The allegations that either President Biden or his son were involved in unlawful actions associated with Burisma have been widelydebunked. … The conspiracies then went viral in the U.S. in the leadup to the 2020 presidential election, fueled in part by a wider campaign among political opponents of Biden who sought to use his son's activities in Ukraine against him.

"Too often, our own personal health can take a backseat to other responsibilities. Unfortunately, busy work schedules, long doctor’s office wait times, and other factors prevent people from looking after their most important responsibility, their health. It’s up to employers to ensure their employees can prioritize their wellbeing, which is why it’s vital to offer healthcare solutions that can meet their workforce’s every need.   Ken Garff Automotive Group, an auto dealer group based in Salt Lake City, has always prided itself on putting its people first and knew its healthcare solution needed to match that sentiment. With rising healthcare costs and increasing medical needs from its employees, Ken Garff needed a partner to help empower its workforce to put their health first. The automotive group, with more than 3,000 employees, set out to accomplish this in three specific ways: creating convenient access to care, considering employees’ unique healthcare needs, and engaging employees to take advantage of the solutions offered to them. Virtual care, at its core, allows employees to take control of their health and access care when and where it is most convenient for them. It offers greater flexibility for a busy workforce, as employees are able to complete regular doctor’s visits without taking time from work – a frequent barrier for many seeking care. In fact, many individuals allow medical issues to go unchecked due to busy schedules, which can sometimes lead to an unplanned, costly urgent care visit or contribute to other adverse health events. But employees shouldn’t wait for problems to arise to seek care. By partnering with Teladoc Health for general medical or virtual urgent care, 56% of Ken Garff employees who otherwise would have gone to urgent care were able to get their needs met quickly and effectively with a virtual telehealth appointment. Members who leveraged virtual care experienced an average medical response time of just 23 minutes, compared to typical hour-long waits at an urgent care. Virtual care is an effective way to help employees manage their health with preventative screenings and general wellness tips to improve overall health outcomes, all on their own schedule. By providing employees access to care that is flexible to their health needs and lifestyles, employers can empower their workforces to keep wellness top of mind and create long-lasting healthy habits. To achieve successful engagement in any healthcare plan, employers must be keenly aware of what their employees need and offer services that are most relevant to them. Ken Garff initially partnered with Teladoc Health for urgent care, but after noticing increased claims around diabetes-related diagnoses and comorbities, the company decided to expand their current program to include Teladoc Health’s Diabetes Management Solution. Managing chronic conditions, like diabetes, can seem like a daunting task, and knowing you’re not alone can make all the difference. Conditions like diabetes require consistent and comprehensive care. Teladoc Health’s Diabetes Management offered Ken Garff employees a digital solution that fits into their everyday life and includes one-on-one coaching, personalized care plans, and 24/7 emergency support for out-of-range readings. Teladoc Health also provides Ken Garff employees easy-to-use medical devices, like connected blood glucose meters, which play a major factor in diabetes management. By offering employees the correct tools, they were able to achieve sustained health improvements, seeing a 1.7% average reduction in A1C (an important metric to measure blood sugar), a powerful indication of what a comprehensive and engaging program can achieve. Ken Garff employees embraced Teladoc Health’s Diabetes Management solution, with 91% engagement in diabetes program device monitoring. “When I have a less than perfect result, [Teladoc Health] gives me real-time suggestions on next steps,” said a Ken Garff employee. “It has made me much more confident in my ability to manage my diabetes.” With the integrated support from a dedicated care team and improved access to quality care, employees no longer feel alone when managing a chronic condition. Any new program or solution requires strong employee education and awareness to ensure adequate engagement, and that couldn’t be truer for all the new benefits offered to Ken Garff employees. To optimize awareness and engagement, Teladoc Health and Ken Garff partnered on a marketing strategy to optimize employee participation. Advertisements on the “Garff TV” in the break rooms and email communications to all staff provided education on health benefits and how to optimize their use of benefits in order to start seeing results. Positive employee experiences began to sweep through the company and upon seeing success in reaching health goals, Ken Garff employees gave Teladoc Health a Net Promotor Score of +81. Employee satisfaction led to increased engagement rates as well, with 35.9% utilization of urgent care services. Employees were not the only ones satisfied. Ken Garff saw $400K savings in Urgent care services claims in 2022. “We feel like we’re getting the most bang for or buck with these services,” said Benefits Manager Anessa Wilkin. “Virtual care was a crucial addition to our benefits offering because we wanted the best of the best for our employees and their loved ones.” The program in place at Ken Garff is a perfect example of how an integrated healthcare experience allows employees to approach and manage their health more holistically. Employers have a growing responsibility to ensure all their employees are able to successfully receive care, and going the extra mile to ensure there are no barriers to entry creates a happier, healthier workforce.","Too often, our own personal health can take a backseat to other responsibilities.

"Climate change causes tens of billions of dollars in economic damage in the United States every year, according to a new assessment. Many survivors of climate-driven disasters, including hurricanes, floods and wildfires, struggle for months or even years to repair their homes or find new stable housing. Here, a Louisiana home damaged by a hurricane sits waiting for unaffordable repairs.Ryan Kellman/NPRhide caption Climate change is expensive, deadly and preventable, according to the new National Climate Assessment, the most sweeping, sophisticated federal analysis of climate change compiled to date. Released every five years, the National Climate Assessment is a congressionally mandated evaluation of the effects of climate change on American life. This new fifth edition paints a picture of a nation simultaneously beset by climate-driven disasters and capable of dramatically reducing emissions of planet-warming gasses in the near future. This is the first time the assessment includes standalone chapters about climate change's toll on the American economy, as well as the complex social factors driving climate change and the nation's responses. And, unlike past installments, the new assessment draws heavily from social science, including history, sociology, philosophy and Indigenous studies. The new approach adds context and relevance to the assessment's robust scientific findings, and underscores the disproportionate danger that climate change poses to poor people, marginalized communities, older Americans and those who work outdoors. ""Climate change affects us all, but it doesn't affect us all equally,"" says climate scientist Katharine Hayhoe, one of the authors of the assessment.  But threaded throughout the report are case studies and research summaries highlighting ways ""climate action can create a more resilient and just country,"" she says. This is also the first time the National Climate Assessment will be translated into Spanish, although the Spanish-language version won't be available until the spring, according to the White House. The National Climate Assessment is extremely influential in legal and policy circles, and affects everything from court cases about who should foot the bill for wildfire damage, to local decisions about how tall to build coastal flood barriers. ""It really shapes the way that people understand, and therefore act, in relation to climate change,"" says Michael Burger, the director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University. Hundreds of scientists from universities, industry, and federal agencies contributed to the report. They reviewed cutting-edge research published since the last report and contextualized it in decades of foundational climate research. The fifth edition of the assessment arrives as millions of Americans are struggling with the effects of a hotter Earth. Dramatic and deadly wildfires, floods and heat waves killed hundreds of people in the United States in 2023. And, while federal spending on renewable energy and disaster preparedness has increased, the U.S. is alsoinvesting in new fossil fuel infrastructurethat is not compatible with avoiding catastrophic warming later this century. Here are the three big takeaways from theFifth National Climate Assessment. More information about the specific effects of climate change in your area can be found in the assessment'sregional chapters. Windmills near Whitewater, Calif., in 2020. Reducing fossil fuel use and investing more in renewable energy sources such as wind will help the U.S. avoid billions of dollars of economic costs and help Americans live longer, healthier lives according to the Fifth National Climate Assessment.Ringo H.W. Chiu/APhide caption Windmills near Whitewater, Calif., in 2020. Reducing fossil fuel use and investing more in renewable energy sources such as wind will help the U.S. avoid billions of dollars of economic costs and help Americans live longer, healthier lives according to the Fifth National Climate Assessment. Food, housing, labor – it all gets pricier as the Earth heats up, according to the National Climate Assessment. Climate-driven weather disasters, like heat waves, floods, hurricanes and wildfires, are particularly expensive. They destroy homes and businesses, wreck crops and create supply shortages by delaying trucks, ships and trains. Such disasters make it more likely that families will go bankrupt, and that municipal governments will run deficits, the authors note. Weather-related disasters in the U.S. cause about $150 billion each year in direct losses, according to the report. That's a lot of money – roughly equal to the annual budget for the Energy Department – and it's only expected to go up as the Earth gets hotter. Loading... And that's all before factoring in the less obvious or tangible costs of climate change. For example, healthcare bills for people who are sicker because of extreme heat, or have respiratory illness brought on by breathing in mold after a flood. Exposure to wildfire smoke alone costs billions of dollars a year in lost earnings, the assessment notes – a burden that falls disproportionately on poor people who work outdoors. ""The research indicates that people who are lower income have more trouble adapting [to climate change], because adaptation comes at a cost,"" says Solomon Hsiang, a climate economist at the University of California, Berkeley and a lead author of the assessment. For example, one of the simplest ways to adapt to severe heat waves is to run your air conditioner more. But ""if people can't pay for it, then [they] can't protect themselves,"" explains Hsiang. And the hotter it gets, the more profound the economic harm, assessment warns. Twice as much planetary warming leads to more than twice as much economic harm, the assessment warns. A roadside memorial to those who died in the wildfire that swept through the town of Lahaina, Hawaii in August. The latest National Climate Assessment underscores the many ways that climate change is already making Americans sick, and even killing them.Claire Harbage/NPRhide caption A roadside memorial to those who died in the wildfire that swept through the town of Lahaina, Hawaii in August. The latest National Climate Assessment underscores the many ways that climate change is already making Americans sick, and even killing them. Since the previous NCA was released five years ago, the health costs of climate change have gone from theoretical to personal for many Americans. The most obvious risk? Extreme weather, particularly heat, says Mary Hayden, the lead author of the chapter examining human health. Heat waves have become hotter, longer, and more dangerous, and they're hitting areas that aren't ready for them–like the ""record-shattering"" heat dome that descended on the Pacific Northwest in 2021 and caused hundreds of deaths. But it's not just heat. Wildfire smoke can send people thousands of miles from the fires to hospitals with respiratory problems and heart disease complications. Hurricanes can disrupt people's access to healthcare: when a clinic is flooded or people are displaced, for example,kidney patients can't get dialysis treatment. In most cases, the people who bear the brunt of the disasters are those already at risk: poor communities, communities of color, women, people with disabilities, and other marginalized groups. Temperatures in formerly redlined neighborhoods in cities across the country cansoar nearly 15 degrees Fahrenheit hotterthan wealthier areas just blocks away, putting residents at much higher risk of heat exposure. The assessment also homes in on research tracking less-obvious health impacts. Living through climate disasters, for example, can leave lasting emotional scars. ""We're not just talking about [people's] physical health–we're talking about their mental health. We're talking about their spiritual health. We're talking about the health and well-being of communities which are being affected by this,"" Hayden  says. That means recognizing the long-term effects on communities like Paradise, California, where people still deal withdeep emotional traumafive years after their town burned in the 2018 Camp Fire. The report also flags the growing emotional toll on children and young people, for whom anxiety about the future of the planet is bleeding into all parts of their lives. A lobsterman paddles out to his boat in a harbor in Maine. Climate change is disrupting ways of living with, and from, the ocean.Ryan Kellmanhide caption The places, cultural practices, and traditions that anchor many communities are also in flux because of climate change. Fishing communities are seeing their livelihoods shift or collapse. The Northeast's iconic lobster fishery, the single most economically valuable in the country, haswithered as marine heatwaves sweep through the regional seas. Shrinking snowpack and too-warm temperatures are interrupting opportunities for beloved recreational activities,like skiing or ice fishing. Indigenous communities are being forced to adjust to new climate realities, which are disrupting traditional food-gathering traditions. In Palau, a monthly tradition of catching fish at a particularly low tide has been upset by sea level rise, which keeps water levels too high to trap fish in thehistorically-used places. Sea level rise is also forcing coastal communities tore-think their very existence,pulling apart the social fabric that has developed over generations. But many communities – Indigenous people, farmers and fishers, groups that have lived tightly connected to their environments for a long time – have deep stores of resilience from which to draw, says Elizabeth Marino, a sociologist and the lead author of the chapter on social transformations. ""There is quite a lot of wisdom in place to adapt to and even mitigate climate change,"" she says. ""It allows people to come up with solutions that fit the lives that they lead, and that's also a place of hope."" The fifth assessment lays out a stark picture of the climate challenges the U.S. faces. Keeping planetary warming to ""well below"" 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit), the goal of the international Paris Agreement, will require immediate, enormous cuts to fossil fuel emissions in the U.S and beyond. Keeping warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit), an ambitious target written into the Agreement, will be even harder, the report says. But it also points out many successful efforts underway to adapt to the new reality and to prevent worse outcomes. ""It's not the message that if we don't hit 1.5 degrees, we're all going to die,"" says Hayhoe. ""It's the message that everything we do matters. Every 10th of a degree of warming we avoid, there's a benefit to that."" Addressing fossil fuel-driven climate change can also help people live healthier lives, stresses J. Jason West, the lead author on a chapter on air quality. Dialing back fossil fuel emissions would help prevent further climate change and also lessen the kinds of air pollution most harmful to human health."" There really is a lot of opportunity to take action that would resolve both of those problems at the same time,"" West says. There's been a subtle shift in the report's perspective since the last one, says Candis Callison, a sociologist and author of the report. There's now a clear acknowledgement, developed through years of rigorous research, that the fossil fuel-powered society the U.S. built over generations was profoundly unjust. Many pollution-producing coal or gas power plants weresited in communities of colorrather than white communities, affecting people's health outcomes for generations. And decisions about land and water use for energy extractionoften excluded tribal communities, with consequences still playing out today. The transition forward can look different, she says. ""Climate change actually provides us with an opportunity to address some of those inequities and injustices–and to respond to these impacts,"" Callison says. ""That's really a powerful thing.""","The National Climate Assessment is a congressionally mandated evaluation of the effects of climate change on American life.

"Dublin, Nov.  16, 2023  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The""UAE Buy Now Pay Later Business and Investment Opportunities Databook - 75+ KPIs on BNPL Market Size, End-Use Sectors, Market Share, Product Analysis, Business Model, Demographics - Q2 2023 Update""report has been added toResearchAndMarkets.com'soffering.BNPL payments in UAE are expected to grow by 19.6% on an annual basis to reach US$2.6 billion in 2023.Medium to long term growth story of BNPL industry in United Arab Emirates remains strong. BNPL payment adoption is expected to grow steadily over the forecast period, recording a CAGR of 12.3% during 2023-2028. The BNPL Gross Merchandise Value in the UAE will increase from US$2.2 billion in 2022 to reach US$4.7 billion by 2028.  The BNPL payment industry in UAE has recorded strong growth over the last four quarters, supported by increased ecommerce penetration.The robust Internet infrastructure coupled with the surging e-commerce market and digital payment ecosystems has supported the growth of the buy now pay later (BNPL) industry in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). With more consumers shopping online in 2022, compared to 2021, the trend has translated into a higher adoption of BNPL schemes across the Emirati region.According to the publisher,, over 37% of consumers have used the BNPL payment schemes in the UAE in 2022. This is much higher, as compared to the 24% who used the BNPL options a year before.Emirati consumers are using BNPL schemes across a broader set of product categoriesWith credit card rates rising in the UAE, consumers in increasing numbers are flocking towards the zero-interest BNPL schemes offered by fintech firms such as Tabby and Tamara in the country.Amid the growing adoption, the BNPL schemes are finding their way to new and a broader set of product categories. Consumers are no longer just using the payment option to buy smartphones. They are even willing to purchase airline tickets through the BNPL payment method. Consequently, providers like Cashew are partnering with travel partners, thereby allowing travellers to access BNPL credit up to Dh 50,000 on airfares.With the willingness of consumers to fund more of their purchases across categories, consumer behavior is opening doors to new industries for BNPL providers in the Emirates. Consequently, the publisher expects providers to enter the travel, education, insurance, and healthcare market over the next three to four years in the UAE. This will keep supporting the industry growth and the adoption among consumers from the short to medium-term perspective.Domestic BNPL firms are expanding their regional operations to accelerate growth rate amid rising adoption among consumersAmid rising competition in the domestic market, UAE-based BNPL providers are now targeting growth in other regional countries to drive the next growth phase of their deferred payment service. In September 2022, Tabby, the Emirati-based leading BNPL provider, announced that the firm is expanding operations into the Egyptian market. In the UAE, the firm works with many leading brands, including Faces, In Your Shoe, Ariika, Marcqa, Floward, and Lacoste, among others. With more than two million active shoppers in the Middle East region, the firm has decided to expand in Egypt after securing US$275 million in funding, since inception, from global and regional investors. In October 2022, the firm also entered into a strategic collaboration with YouGotaGift, one of the leading digital gift card marketplaces in the region. Under the collaboration, the two firms will allow consumers and shoppers to buy gift cards using the BNPL payment method offered by Tabby. The partnership comes at a time when the year-end holiday and gifting season is about to commence in the Emirates. Thus, the publisher expects the service to garner traction among consumers from the short-term perspective.Firms are forging strategic alliances to launch new BNPL solutions in the EmiratesWith the surging cost of living and rise in prices of products, consumers are finding it difficult to fund their purchases. Consequently, BNPL providers are forging new partnerships to offer BNPL services to consumers in the United Arab Emirates. For instance, In October 2022, Cashew, one of the leading BNPL services in the Emirates, announced that the firm had entered into a strategic collaboration with du, a telecom provider in the UAE. Under the collaboration, Cashew will offer BNPL solutions on device financing for du's customers. This will enable consumers to purchase devices, at zero-additional cost, which were previously out of their budget. To accelerate its growth in the domestic market, the firm also announced that it is seeking to raise US$70 million. As part of its mega fund-raising round, the firm is already in negotiations with family offices in Saudi Arabia and venture capital firms in the United States and Singapore. With the demand for BNPL schemes growing in the Emirati market, the publisher expects the firm to receive healthy interest from global investors, including venture capital and private equity firms.This report provides a detailed data centric analysis of Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) industry, covering market opportunities and risks across a range of retail categories.

"Mark Zuckerberg revealed Meta is testing a new tagging feature for Threads that’s like hashtags, but not exactly. Yes, you’ll use a hashtag to create or add to a topic’s conversation, but instead of showing up as a hashtagged word, Threads converts it to a blue-text hyperlink. Australian users will get the first crack at it in the initial “limited test” before it gets a wider release. Typing a “#” into the post text field brings up a card with the topic you’re tagging or other, similar ones. Underneath that, each of the topics comes with a count of posts about it, just like Instagram does. Related Instagram’s Threads: all the updates on the new Twitter competitor Those with Threads’ new tagging feature can only add a single topic to a post at a time, which will probably limit anyone hoping to spam their posts for better reach. But again, this could be a nice thing, especially if you like the clean look Threads has (for now), or for anyone who hates in-line hashtags . Meta says it will continue to work on the feature as time goes on, so this first version probably won’t be its final form. It’s been a busy week for Threads news. Meta added options to keep Threads posts off Instagram and Facebook, made it possible to delete Threads accounts independently of Instagram , and also rolled out pinned posts for everyone . Oh, and Instagram boss Adam Mosseri kept up Threads’ will-they-won’t-they when it comes to DMs. Comments","Threads is testing a new tagging feature that's like hashtags, but not exactly.

"When Rosemarie Palafox first heard about a social experiment where hundreds of Denver residents experiencing homelessness would begiven free cash for a year, she thought it was too good to be true. ""It was all over the news, and I had no idea why they were doing that project,"" Palafox, a 43-year-old Native American born in Denver, told Insider. ""But it's freaking awesome."" For six months in 2022, Palafox had been living in a tent at one of Denver's safe outdoor spaces, temporary shelters for unhoused people operated by the local government and the nonprofit Colorado Village Collaborative. ""There was no food or anything when I was there, just a truck that came around once a week for laundry, but it was better than living outside on the streets,"" she said. Last October, Palafox was entered into the lottery for the Denver Basic Income Project, along with the others at the shelter. She became one of more than 800 people to be enrolled in the program. ""It helped a lot: I was able to pay my bills and go to school without worrying about work,"" Palafox, who's in college to become a construction project manager, said. ""I finally had room to breathe."" But with the last payment coming in just a few weeks, Palafox is starting to feel the familiar anxieties over money returning. ""I don't know what I'm going to do. I'm trying to figure it out,"" she said. The Denver Basic Income Project was founded in 2021 to examine the impact of guaranteed income on wealth disparity in the US. ""Direct cash is increasingly seen as one of the most effective ways to fight poverty and economic inequality. The dramatic wealth disparity in our country, including right here in Denver, was more apparent than ever amid the pandemic,"" Mark Donovan, founder and executive director of the Denver Basic Income Project, told Insider in an email. More than two-thirds of the 807 participants in the past year's program identified as people of color, with around 26% identifying as Black, 23% identifying as Latinx, and 5% identifying as American Indian/Alaska Native, according to Donovan. The project's participant pool was ""designed to mirror the demographics of those that experience homelessness in Denver,"" Donovan said, emphasizing the project's mission of equity. 40% of people experiencing homelessness in the US are Black, 22% Hispanic, and 3% Native American, according to data from the National Alliance to End Homelessness. The participants were split into three groups: One received $1,000 a month for a year; another received $6,500 up front and then $500 a month from there; and another received just $50 a month. Palafox was part of the second group. She used the money to furnish the apartment she'd started renting using a housing voucher, plus other necessities and books for college. She also could focus on her studies without worrying about taking on a hodgepodge of temp jobs to pay for rent. Palafox said she wishes there were more guaranteed-income programs, especially as someone from a marginalized background. ""I'm a person of color, and it's hard to get ahead as it is,"" Palafox told Insider. ""I was stuck at a minimum-wage job for a long time because I was not in the position to get a decent job due to intersecting parts of my identity. I felt like I was held back."" Palafox said the money she received from the program helped her ""get ahead."" For example, it wasn't until she went to college that she used a computer for the first time, opening up avenues for higher-paying work — not to mention access to other resources. ""Without money, you're kept in a rut,"" Palafox said. Although this year's project is ending, Donovan said the organization is ""emphasizing the significance of continuing to seek out support"" as participants ""strive for long-term stability."" The Denver Basic Income Project has received a $2 million commitment from the City of Denver in its 2024 budget, and is in talks to determine next steps, according to Donovan.","Denver residents experiencing homelessness will beg for free cash for a year.

"A court in Uganda has charged a man with terrorism along with other offences over the killing last month of two tourists and their guide. Abdul Rashid Kyoto is allegedly a commander in the Islamic State-linked Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) militia. He is accused of killing a honeymoon couple from the UK and South Africa and their Ugandan guide in an attack in a national park on 17 October. Mr Kyoto made no comment when the charges were read out. He will be asked to plead once the case reaches the High Court, which is where murder and terrorism trials are heard. British citizen David Barlow, his South African wife Emmaretia Geyer and Ugandan Eric Alyai were shot dead on a visit to see the wildlife at the Queen Elizabeth National Park. Their vehicle was also burnt. The attack was blamed on the ADF, which has a presence in western Uganda, but mostly operates in the eastern part of neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo. The two countries have intensified operations targeting the group in recent months. But on Monday, it was blamed for the killing of 19 people and the kidnapping of several others in the east of DR Congo. Among the charges against My Kyoto approved by Uganda's director of public prosecutions were two of terrorism, three of murder and one of belonging to a terrorist organisation. Pictures from the magistrate's court in eastern Uganda show him dressed in a white tunic, or kanzu, and walking with the aid of a crutch under his right arm. He was arrested last week in an army operation on Lake Edward, on the border between Uganda and DR Congo.  ""Two of his associates were shot dead and others managed to escape in a boat with their weapons,"" a statement from the prosecution authority said. The ADF has staged several attacks in Uganda in recent years. In June, a group of ADF fighters attacked a school in western Uganda, killing nearly 40 pupils. The group was created in western Uganda in the 1990s and took up arms, alleging government persecution of Muslims. Muslims make up almost 14% of the Ugandan population, according to official figures, though the Ugandan Muslim Supreme Council estimates the figure is closer to 35%. Some members of Uganda's Muslim community say they face discrimination in public life, such as in education and the workplace. After defeat by the Ugandan army in 2001, the ADF relocated to North Kivu province in DR Congo.","Abdul Rashid Kyoto is allegedly a commander in the Islamic State-linked Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) militia.

"LIVONIA, Mich., Nov.  16, 2023  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- While many headlines indicate battery electric vehicle (BEV) adoption is increasing, traction remains slow in the commercial vehicle and fleet segment, where decision-makers cite several reasons for apprehension, including seeking proof manufacturers can deliver reliable products and easy-to-implement electrification solutions. Surprisingly, vehicle brand is neither a primary motivator nor constraint for BEV consideration. Only 5% of fleet decision-makers cite “brands offering BEVs” as a top three reason to consider a BEV, while 5% also indicate it as a challenge, or barrier, to adoption. On the other hand, attributes that define brand reputation and underpin a brand promise—such as vehicle cost, quality/reliability/durability and performance—resonate with decision-makers. These are the latest findings of the newest Fleet Electrification Brand Landscape Report from Escalent’sFleet Advisory Hub™, a leading insights program designed to explore the needs, expectations and emotions of commercial vehicle and fleet decision-makers. This report explores the perspectives of nearly 1,000 fleet decision-makers on manufacturer brand-related sentiments across four key fleet and commercial vehicle segments: light passenger, commercial van, commercial pickup truck and medium/heavy-duty vehicles. Legacy brands Ford, Chevrolet/GMC and Ram currently benefit from established relationships in the fleet sector, which may provide a short-term advantage for BEV consideration among fleet decision-makers. However, established brands may face challenges from emerging start-ups—notably Tesla, which has an already stronger retail foothold than other start-ups, and especially Rivian, which performs strongly among those who are familiar with the brand and has now opened order books beyond its Amazon contract.More importantly, with half (51%) of decision-makers needing to see BEV technology be proven, fleet leaders are awaiting objective and relevant, real-world use cases demonstrating BEV reliability and performance in order for BEVs to earn a spot in their future consideration sets. “A seamless journey is needed, meaning a holistic customer and ownership experience that proves BEVs can meet the needs of the business, are reliable and are worth the long-term investment,” said Lucas Lowden, insights consultant and program lead of Fleet Advisory Hub at Escalent. “In order to gain traction with BEVs in the commercial vehicle market beyond early adopters, manufacturers and regulators must prove that transition is beneficial.” While the study found that almost one-quarter (23%) of decision-makers are integrating BEVs into their fleet and 40% believe BEVs are the future, overall market penetration among commercial vehicles remains at around 1%, which indicates that businesses are integrating only a small number of BEVs at a time rather than replacing at large scale—leading to less market traction than many expect. Driving range, battery life and replacement costs, time to charge, charging infrastructure and total cost of ownership are the top areas of opportunity for industry stakeholders to address to better meet the business needs of fleets, according to the study. “These challenges are nonstarters for most fleet decision-makers. BEVs will not gain meaningful traction in the commercial vehicle and fleet sector if these areas are not addressed by industry stakeholders,” added Lowden. “Early adopters are typically larger fleets that are willing and able to take on risk as well as tolerate less than ideal experiences. However, fast followers are much less accepting of risk and a poor ownership experience, which is why they need more proof. If they hear of or have negative experiences, they’ll opt out of BEV adoption until they feel that the problem areas have been corrected.” Despite this, there are concepts for industry stakeholders to embrace that can help mitigate the risk of BEV adoption that comes with traditional vehicle acquisition and ownership. Fleet decision-makers say they would be more likely to consider BEVs with pilot test programs tailored to specific company needs (52%), fleet-as-a-service initiatives (49%), or turnkey solutions that provide full support to acquire and onboard BEVs into business operations (46%).

"London Councils has called on the government to provide at least a 9% funding boost in the Autumn Statement to help meet a £600m shortfall. The body, which represents the city's 32 borough councils, forecasts the collective annual overspend has increased by 50% due to a spike in spending between June and September. This is due to ""London's worsening homelessness crisis"", it said. The chancellor is due to set out his spending plans on Wednesday. As well as the 9% funding increase, which would be in line with last year's Autumn Statement, the cross-party body has also requested that the government invest in homelessness initiatives and ""reforms to the broken local government finance system"", a spokesperson said. Councillor Claire Holland, acting chairwoman of London Councils, said the current demand on homelessness services was ""utterly unsustainable"". ""Alongside massive demands on adult and children's social care services, spiralling inflation, and insufficient funding from government, boroughs are left in an extremely precarious position,"" she said. About one in 50 Londoners are currently homeless, according to analysis from the group. Homelessness services in the capital are facing a £150m overspend, it said.  Ms Holland called on the chancellor to help London's local authorities to ""weather the storm"".  Croydon Council has already declared bankruptcy, while Havering Council, in east London, said it could be bankrupt within six months.  Enfield Council said there was ""no evidence"" it would go bust, despite £1.12bn of debt, the 10th highest of England's local authorities. London Councils said despite there being 800,000 more Londoners since 2010, London boroughs' resources remained a fifth lower than they were 13 years ago. A government spokesperson said: ""London Boroughs have seen an increase in Core Spending Power of up to £744m (9.3%) on 2022-23 - making available a total of up to £8.757bn in 2023-24. ""We are determined to prevent homelessness before it occurs and are providing London councils with £350m funding through the Homelessness Prevention Grant to help those at risk access the private rented sector.""

"washington: the united states on thursday (nov 2) imposed sweeping new measures against moscow over the war in ukraine, targeting russia's future energy capabilities, sanctions evasion and a suicide drone that has been a menace to ukrainian troops and equipment, among others, in sanctions on hundreds of people and entities. the latest measures target a major entity involved in the development, operation and ownership of a massive project in siberia known as arctic-2 lng, the state department said in a statement. the project expected to ship chilled natural gas, known as liquefied natural gas to global markets. washington also targeted the kub-bla and lancet suicide drones being used by the russian military in ukraine, designating a network it accused of procuring items in support of their production as well as the creator and designer of the drones. the biden administration on thursday added a dozen russian companies to a trade blacklist for supporting russia's military with drones that could be used to aid in moscow's invasion of ukraine, the commerce department said in a statement. the us also cracked down on sanctions evasion in the united arab emirates, turkey and china, as the treasury department said companies based in the countries continue to send high priority dual-use goods to russia, including components moscow relies on for its weapons systems. seven russia-based banks and dozens of industrial firms were also hit with sanctions by the treasury department, including gazpromneft catalytic systems llc, which treasury said manufactures chemical agents for advanced oil refining in russia. the kremlin said on thursday ahead of the action that it expected the west to impose ever tougher sanctions on it over the war, but that there was a growing sense that such penalties hurt western interests while russia's economy was adapting well. with the sanctions on the sanctions on limited liability company arctic lng 2, and previous measures imposed on the project in september, the us is trying to target russia's upcoming energy production, similar to how it targeted its future deep-sea, shale and arctic oil production after moscow's invasion of crimea in 2014. all of these hard-to-produce projects depend on western technology. the us, itself a large lng producer that exports to europe, is also trying to reduce russia's lng shipments to europe, which has only banned russian gas sent via pipeline. arctic-2 lng has been expecting to start exporting soon and it is uncertain how much russian lng would be blocked by the new measures. the largest russian lng producer novatek said in september it would start shipments from arctic-2 lng early next year. the united states, european union and other western nations have imposed rafts of sanctions on moscow following its invasion of ukraine, including targeting russian banks and president vladimir putin, as the partners seek to hold russia to account for the conflict that has killed thousands and reduced cities to rubble.

"an airport indagestan, russia, was at the center of ugly scenes over the weekendwhen a mob chanting antisemitic slurs attempted to seek out jewish passengers arriving from tel aviv. in the wake of the violence, rather than trying to calm tensions in the muslim-majority region,russian president vladimir putinmade unevidenced claims that the west was responsible for the unrest. ""the events in makhachkala last night were instigated through social networks, not least from ukraine, by the hands of agents of western special services,"" he said in a meeting of the russian security council,according to the afp news wire. he added that there had been ""attempts"" to destabilize russian society, and accused the us of being behind the war between israel and hamas, which triggered the riots, reported the afp. ""who is organizing the deadly chaos and who benefits from it today, in my opinion, has already become obvious... it is the current ruling elites of the us and their satellites who are the main beneficiaries of world instability,"" putin said. the russian president has long accused the west of sowing chaos and instability, with kremlin propagandists casting the war in ukraine as part of a plot by the west to destroy russia. putin's latest remarks are part of a wider plan to convince the world that the west is the enemy — and some countries are buying it. one of putin's core objectives is to break western attempts to isolate russia as punishment for the ukraine invasion. as part of this, a russian disinformation campaign has been seeking to link western-supplied ukrainian weapons to thehamas terrorist attackson october 7 against israel, which sparked the war in the middle east. analysts say the campaign, along with putin's latest comments, could deepen the rift between the us, israel, and europe, and nations in the middle east and so-called ""global south,"" which includes brazil, india, pakistan, indonesia, and china. ""the war in the middle east will drive a growing wedge between the west and countries like brazil or indonesia, key swing states of the global south,"" clifford kupchan, chairman of the eurasia group, a new york-based risk assessment organization,told the new york times. ""that will make international cooperation on ukraine, like sanctions enforcement on russia, even harder."" for its part, the us has sought to rally global opposition to russia by pointing to the atrocities, infrastructure attacks, and human rights abuses committed by the russian military in ukraine. but in its adamant support for israel's campaign in gaza, which, has so far killed around 8,000 people, it has opened itself to accusations of hypocrisy, analysts say. ""all the discourse and the efforts of the west have been undermined. it's a godsend for moscow, which hopes to break out of its isolation on the international stage by virtue of the opening of this new front in the middle east,"" tatiana kastueva-jean, director of the russia/eurasia center of the french institute of international relations (ifri), told le monde. ""russia's invasion has brought to the surface accumulated global anger and resentment towards european countries and the us, whether for centuries of colonialism and neocolonial practices or for the double standards western countries have so often displayed towards the violations of rights and law in different parts of the world,"" nathalie tocci, director of the italian institute of international affairs,wrote in the guardian. putin is exploiting this rift. in repeatedly portraying the us as the source of the unrest, he wants to bolster not just existing alliances, such as those with syria, and hamas' main backer iran, but also gain favor with the gulf states whose leaders are traditionally aligned with washington and whose populations support palestinian autonomy. the russian president has good relations with israel's prime minister benjamin netanyahu, but apparently sees there is more to be gained in stirring opposition to israel's campaign in gaza and its alliance with the us. russia in recent weeks hosted the leaders of hamas, the organization behind the october 7 terrorist attacks in israel, and criticized the israeli response to the attacks, even likening the israeli attacks on gaza to the siege of leningrad in world war ii. in generating anger at the west over war in the middle east, putin is betting that he can turn the tables, and the west, not russia, will be facing isolation.","Russian president Vladimir putin made unevidenced claims that the west was responsible for the unrest.

"Nine orphaned ducklings have been rescued after their mother was run over by a car. The duck, called Moscow, was killed as she checked it was safe for her ducklings to cross a road in Glossop, Derbyshire. She was trying to move them to a safe place for the night, as there was not enough space on the island in the middle of their pond in Howard Park. Nearly all the ducklings from her last two broods were killed by cars or dogs. Tanayha Marshall, who is known as the Bird Lady of Glossop because she rescues so many birds, caught the ducklings with the help of four other women from the town. Speaking about the mother duck, she said: ""She passed away trying to protect them, it's unbelievable. ""Luckily enough she wasn't with her babies, it was her going checking if the road was clear for the babies to cross. ""It was definitely a speeding car that hit her. There was a van that stopped to help. ""When the guy was picking the mum off the road the ducklings were coming up to him to say 'What are you doing with my mum?' and pecking his feet."" Moscow was killed on Monday and her nine ducklings were rescued on Tuesday. She originally had 12 ducklings, but Ms Marshall said one was hit by a car and two were ""savaged by a dog in the park"". It was Moscow's third brood. Only two ducklings survived from her first, and none survived from her second. ""The last litter all got killed on the road, that's why she had a clutch so late in the season, because she lost all her babies,"" said Ms Marshall.

It represents a commitment to a lifestyle that transcends conventional boundaries, paving the way for a more sustainable, compassionate, and luxurious way of living. The Journey In the world of luxury self-care, one brand has consistently stood out since its inception in 2012 - Kimirica Lifestyle. What sets Kimirica Lifestyle apart from the rest is its dedication to being the primary innovator, formulator, and manufacturer of every product it offers. This meticulous approach ensures that every facet of the brand, from product design to ingredient selection, aligns with its core values of ethics and sustainability. Kimirica's ultimate vision is to deliver a self-care experience that is not only luxurious but also environmentally responsible, safe, and enriching. One remarkable aspect of Kimirica Lifestyle's global influence is the fact that every two seconds, a Kimirica product is used somewhere around the world. This astonishing reach can be attributed to the brand's partnerships with prestigious luxury hotels such as Leela, Hyatt, Fairmont, Hilton, Jumeirah, and Radisson, which have made Kimirica products a staple in the hospitality industry. The inception of Kimirica was sparked during a hotel visit by Rica and her husband, Rajat Jain, who were struck by the prevalence of imported single-use toiletries in the rooms. Recognizing the untapped potential for locally-made custom self-care products in India, they embarked on a journey that led to a partnership with Mohit and Kimi Jain in the creation of Kimirica. In 2017, this venture took a significant step by forming a joint venture with Canadian hospitality product manufacturer Hunter Amenities, resulting in the full name 'Kimirica Hunter International'. Initially envisioning a retail venture, Rica and Kimi pivoted towards a B2B focus due to financial constraints. As the B2B segment flourished, the dream of entering the retail space remained alive, fueled by guest inquiries about accessing Kimirica products for personal use. Today, the combined entities of Kimirica Hunter International and Kimirica Lifestyle boast an impressive annual turnover of approximately Rs 600 crore, a testament to their dedication and entrepreneurial spirit. Recently, Kimirica Lifestyle garnered significant attention with its collaboration with the internationally acclaimed star, Kiara Advani. Co-founder Kimi Jain expressed her delight, stating, ""We are pleased to announce our partnership with Kiara Advani. I couldn't think of a better face to promote our brand. The story of Kimirica is, in a true sense, a Love Story, and I am elated to see that Kiara loves the brand as much as we do. Kimirica is redefining luxury. Our passion is to spread joy through natural, sustainable, luxurious experiences.

"Global Times Meeting paves way for higher-level meetings between three countries; shore up three countries' cooperation By Zhao Yusha Published: Nov 26, 2023 10:30 PM China is willing to make efforts with both South Korea and Japan to promote the resumption of trilateral cooperation, Chinese top diplomat said at the trilateral foreign ministers' meeting between China, Japan and South Korea which was held in the South Korean city of Bushan on Sunday. The three sides agreed to create conditions for the trilateral meeting of the leaders of China, Japan and South Korea, and speed up preparations, according to a statement issued by China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Sunday night. Chinese experts believe the meeting, held after a hiatus of four years, will not only pave way for higher-level meetings between the three Asian countries, but will also inject stability in the region and shore up the three countries' cooperation to offset the negative consequences of the current challenges from the global turmoil. However, both Seoul and Tokyo are urged to take more actions and show sincerity if they want cooperation between the three countries to yield substantial results, Chinese experts said as there are still unsolved divergences that are plaguing trilateral ties. Meanwhile, extraterritorial forces are also seeking to use Japan and South Korea to contain China and seek to scuttle the trilateral cooperation. Experts said that inviting non-regional countries to interfere with regional issues is detrimental to cooperation, thus it is of vital importance for both Japan and South Korea to remain autonomous. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, also a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, attended the trilateral foreign ministers' meeting. This year marks the resumption of the trilateral foreign ministers' meeting between China, Japan, and South Korea after a four-year hiatus, as close neighbors, China will continue to adhere to the principles of being friendly and cooperative with its neighbors and work together with South Korea and Japan to promote the resumption of trilateral cooperation, Wang was quoted by CGTN as saying. Wang said that as important countries in the Asia-Pacific region, the three countries should base themselves on the peace and development of the Asia-Pacific region and the interests of its people, deepen regional cooperation, jointly address risks and challenges, and maintain regional peace and prosperity. He stressed that the three countries should oppose drawing ideological lines and resist regional bloc formation. Beijing, Tokyo and Seoul should act as ""stabilizers"" for maintaining regional peace and security, practice a common, comprehensive, cooperative, and sustainable security concept, and insist on resolving differences and disputes through dialogue and peaceful means. They should also act as ""pressure relief valves"" for resolving hotspot issues, said Wang, noting that the continued tension on the Korean Peninsula is not in the interest of any party. The urgent task is to cool down the situation, create necessary conditions for restarting dialogue, and take meaningful actions to achieve it. Before the trilateral meeting, Wang held meetings with South Korean Foreign Minister Park Jin and Japanese Foreign Minister Yoko Kamikawa on Sunday and Saturday respectively. In his meeting with Park, Wang said China and South Korea are neighboring countries and this fact will never change. Both countries can benefit from a positive relationship, while both sides will suffer if the relationship deteriorates. Wang also stressed that both sides should jointly resist the tendency to politicize economic issues, instrumentalize technological issues, and over-securitize economic and trade issues, in order to maintain stable and smooth supply chains and promote greater development in bilateral economic and trade cooperation. Wang and Park exchanged views on the Korean Peninsula situation. Wang emphasized that China has always been a stabilizing force in the Northeast Asian and will continue to play a constructive role in easing the situation on the Korean Peninsula. During a meeting with Kamikawa, Wang said China and Japan should earnestly implement consensus reached by leaders of the two countries to push forward bilateral relations along the right track of sound development. Wang told Kamikawa that both sides should respect each other's legitimate concerns. Japan should honor its commitments on the Taiwan question, strictly abide by the one-China principle and refrain from interfering in China's internal affairs. Noting that Japan's discharge of Fukushima nuclear-contaminated water into the ocean concerns marine safety and public health, Wang said China opposes Japan's irresponsible action. Amid complicated international atmosphere, the trilateral foreign ministers' meeting between the three major Asian countries can inject much needed stability in Northeast Asia; as well as deepen cooperation, exchange between the three countries to offset negative impact of current geopolitical tensions, Da Zhigang, director of the Institute of Northeast Asian Studies at Heilongjiang Provincial Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times. Da noted the meeting between the three countries' foreign ministers may pave way for higher-level trilateral meetings in the near future. It will also help to control current divergences among Beijing, Tokyo and Seoul, whilst expanding cooperation in areas where the three share common interests, he added. Sincerity needed Ties between the three countries have been frayed since the last trilateral meeting among the leaders of the three Northeast Asian nations was held in Chengdu, China, in 2019. Historical issues such as Japan's wartime atrocities during WWII, as well as current tussles like Japan's irresponsible releasing of nuclear-contaminated wastewater from the crippled Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant into the Pacific Ocean; Tokyo and Seoul's role as US vassals in the region, continued to plague the ties. South Korea and Japan are eager to mend ties with China not only because the prospect of cooperating with China is in line with their national interest, but the warming up China-US ties after a summit in San Francisco between leaders of the two countries earlier this month propelled Seoul and Tokyo to reach out, Lü Chao, an expert on the Korean Peninsula at the Liaoning Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times. ""As the international society is at a historic turning point as it faces major challenges and changes, we hope to discuss our strategic significance of Japan-China-South Korea cooperation,"" Kamikawa told reporters Friday, according to a report from AP. While meeting with UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and signing The Downing Street Accord last week, South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol's made remarks related to China's Taiwan and the South China Sea. ""China urges relevant parties to stop making irresponsible comments on issues bearing on China's core and major concerns and be very prudent about what they say or do,"" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said on Friday. Similar to the US, Japan and South Korea tend to talk up cooperation with China whilst disrespecting China's core interests, which create obstacles for the three to cooperate, said Lü. He noted that China is willing to meet Japan and South Korea half way to expand cooperation, but also won't hesitate to strike back any unilateral crackdown on China and disrespectable remarks or behaviors that are against China's core interest. ""For the three countries to pick up momentum in deepening cooperation, we need to see more actions, more sincerity from both Tokyo and Seoul,"" Lü noted. Extraterritorial threats Although the easing of China-US ties partly stimulated Japan and South Korea's willingness to reach out to China, Chinese experts believe a closer China-Japan-South Korea trilateral tie is will not make the US happy. US President Joe Biden and the leaders of South Korea and Japan agreed at Camp David in August to deepen military and economic cooperation and made their strongest joint condemnation yet of ""dangerous and aggressive behavior"" by China in the South China Sea. Da said that in recent years, the US has been plotting to work with its allies to create an Asian NATO, which extremely threatens regional stability. In a forum held in Qingdao in July this year, Wang Yi urged that China, Japan and South Korea, as well as other Asian countries, should practice open regionalism, promote inclusive Asian values, cultivate strategic autonomy, safeguard regional unity and stability, resist the Cold War mentality, and avoid coercion by hegemony. Asian countries should solve our differences by ourselves, while inviting extraterritorial powers to intervene is extremely detrimental to the stability and cooperation between China, Japan and South Korea, said Da, urging the two to remain autonomous. He warned that those countries should learn from history that relying on non-regional countries to solve regional issues will eventually backfire, which will threaten the whole region.","China willing to make efforts with both South Korea and Japan to promote the resumption of trilateral cooperation.

"yesterday's third-quarter results will not reverse the trend. sales are down and the ebitda margin target - already hardly ambitious - has been abandoned. as it is, the swedish group's colossal r&d expenditure remains a bottomless pit. three years ago, after a long period of underperformance, we thought ericsson's time had finally come, thanks to the first 5g deployments and huawei's expulsion from the european and american markets. alas, the financial situation of operators is putting a damper on these hopes. in the u.s., they have debts that border on the unsustainable; in europe, due to a far too fragmented market, they are unable to pass on the price increases needed to finance a new investment cycle. in 2021, the acquisition of vonage was grossly overpaid. unsurprisingly, ericsson took a $2.9 billion impairment charge this quarter in connection with the transaction. all this looks bad, especially in the wake of the scandal surrounding bribe payments to the islamic state in iraq. this is not the first time ericsson has been targeted by the us department of justice. there have previously been corruption cases in djibouti, indonesia and china. some argue that this is a strategy to destabilize the swedish company - owner of highly strategic know-how - with the activist fund cevian as a trojan horse. last year, market share gains were offset by the effects of inflation. this year promises to be equally disappointing: over the first nine months, the swedish group is not burning cash - that's something - but it's not making any either.","Swedish group's colossal r&d expenditure remains a bottomless pit. in the u.s., they have debts that border on the unsustainable. in europe, due to a far too fragmented market, they are unable to compete.","On 24 February 2023, Swedish group's colossal r&d expenditure remains a bottomless pit. in the u.s., they have debts that border on the unsustainable. in europe, due to a far too fragmented market, they are unable to compete. in asia, they have to make concessions to local competition.

"washington :     millions of people in the americas will be in a position to witness an astronomical treat on saturday with a solar eclipse in which - weather permitting - the moon will be seen passing in front of the sun. the eclipse is due to be visible along a path covering parts of the united states, mexico and several countries in central america and south america. here is an explanation of the type of solar eclipse that will occur and where it will be visible. what is an annular solar eclipse? a solar eclipse happens when the moon journeys between  earth and the sun, blocking the view along a small path of earth of some or all of the sun's face as it passes. the one that will occur on saturday is a type called an ""annular solar eclipse."" this occurs when the moon passes between earth and the sun at a time when the moon is at or close to its farthest point from our planet. it does not completely obscure the face of the sun, unlike in a total solar eclipse. why does it look like a ring of fire? because the moon is farther than usual from earth during an annular solar eclipse, the moon will not completely obscure the sun, instead looking like a dark disk superimposed atop the sun's larger, bright face in the sky. as a result, the eclipse will momentarily look like a ring of fire surrounding the dark disc of the moon. a total solar eclipse is due to occur on april 8, 2024, passing over mexico, the united states and canada. where will it be visible and what is its path? according to the u.s. space agency nasa, the path in the united states where the maximum obscuring of the sun will occur on saturday runs through parts of several states beginning at 9:13 a.m. pdt (12:13 p.m. edt/1613 gmt) in oregon, then california, nevada, utah, arizona, new mexico and texas. the path then crosses over parts of mexico, guatemala, belize, honduras, nicaragua, panama, colombia and brazil before ending at sunset in the atlantic ocean. people in much larger parts of north america, central america and south america will be able to see lesser obscuring of the sun - still an impressive sight. how big are the earth, moon and sun? the moon will nearly cover the sun's face, as visible from earth, only because the moon - in actuality much smaller than the sun - is so much closer to our planet. the moon's diameter is 2,159 miles (3,476 km), compared to the sun's diameter of about 865,000 miles (1.4 million km) and earth's diameter of 7,918 miles (12,742 km). what is the safest way to watch an eclipse? experts warn that it is unsafe to look directly at the bright sun without using specialized eye protection designed for solar viewing, risking eye injury. because the sun is never fully blocked by the moon in an annular solar eclipse, it is never safe to look directly at it without such eye protection. viewing it through a camera lens, binoculars or telescope without making use of a special-purpose solar filter can cause severe eye injury, according to these experts. they advise using safe solar viewing glasses or a safe handheld solar viewer at all times during an annular solar eclipse, noting that regular sunglasses are not safe for viewing the sun. how do solar eclipses differ from lunar eclipses? lunar eclipses occur when earth is positioned between the moon and the sun and our planet's shadow is cast upon the lunar surface. this leaves the moon looking dim from earth, sometimes with a reddish color. lunar eclipses are visible from half of earth, a much wide area than solar eclipses.","An annular solar eclipse happens when the moon journeys between  earth and the sun, blocking the view along a small path of earth of some or all of the sun's face.

"Part of the appeal of Google Docs is its clean, accessible interface: open up a document, and the invitation is there to simply dive in and start typing without having to bother with settings screens or page configurations. However, that doesn’t mean the word processor app is lacking in features. Since its arrival way back in 2005 under the name Writely, it’s gradually been adding more and more in the way of useful functionality. If you’re busy with your actual writing, you might not have discovered all of these features yet. Here are a few worth checking out. Take a look and see if they can give your productivity a boost or enhance the way you go about creating your documents. Look up definitions The dictionary built into Google Docs isn’t just there to put red lines under misspelled words — it can help you look up words you don’t know. Select a word, then choose Tools > Dictionary to see a definition. Alternatively, select a word and then press Ctrl + Shift + Y (Windows) or Cmd + Shift + Y (macOS). Switch to a pageless view If you’re not printing out your work, then you might want to do away with the on-screen page borders and give yourself an infinite canvas to work with (along the lines of something like Notion ). In this mode, elements like tables and pictures can be stretched to fit the screen rather than the page. To switch between the Pages and Pageless views, open the File menu and choose Page setup . On the same dialog, you have the option to choose which view is the default for new documents you create. Go pageless to make full use of the screen. Create building blocks When you create a new empty document, you will see three choices at the top of the page: Meeting notes , Email draft , and More . The first two come under the auspices of what Google calls building blocks — in other words, templates that offer a variety of useful starting points. For example, if you’ve got a longer email to write, you might find it easier to compose it in Google Docs rather than Gmail. It’s also great for collaborating on email drafts with other people in the same way you would collaborate on a standard document. Related Quick fixes: how to download an image from a Google Doc How to add Markdown support to Google Docs Google 101: how to format text in Google Docs Choose Email draft or (if you don’t see the choice at the top of the document) select Insert > Building blocks > Email draft . You’ll be supplied with an email template that includes fields for the recipients and the subject header. When your email looks good to go, click the Gmail icon to the left, and you’ll get a preview of the email. You can then make changes or click Send . You can also pick Meeting notes to create a template for taking notes at a meeting (with the option to attach the document to the relevant Google Calendar entry). Google Docs has other building blocks you can make use of: find them on the Insert > Building blocks menu or by clicking More at the top of a new document. For example, there’s Project roadmap , Review tracker , Project assets , and Launch tracker . In each case, you get elements added to your document, like tables and drop-down menus, that help with that particular task. Create a table of contents You don’t have to spend time manually creating a table of contents for longer documents because Google Docs can do it for you. Just make sure you use one of the heading formats throughout your document — either from the drop-down list on the toolbar (that says Normal text by default) or via the Format > Paragraph styles menu option. Whichever method you use to apply headings, you’ll see you get two options for each heading: to set the selected text in the heading style or use the format of the selected text as the heading style (should you want to change the default heading styles). You can create the table of contents before you start working on the text, after you’ve finished, or at any point in between — as long as the headings are there. Go to the point in the document where you want the table of contents to be, then choose Insert > Table of contents and pick a style. If you make changes after inserting the table of contents, right-click anywhere on it and choose Update table of contents . To tweak the text formatting for the table of contents, hover over it and click the three dots to the left and then More options . Point Google Docs to another document and it’ll compare it with the current one. Compare two documents There may well be times when you need to compare two documents against each other, and Google Docs can help. Open the Tools menu and pick Compare documents , then select the other document to compare with the current one: Google Docs will present you with a detailed breakdown of where they differ in a new document. Explore beyond your document Select Tools then Explore and a new panel opens up on the right-hand side. You can use this panel to search the web and your Google Drive account. Click and drag to drop anything you find into the document you’re working on. React with emoji Sometimes an emoji reaction is all you need — you can, for example, speed up the collaboration process by using them instead of comments. Hover over the right-hand side of a paragraph in a document, and you’ll see an emoji option appear alongside the option to add a comment. (If you’re in editing mode, you’ll also see an icon that lets you switch to “suggest edits.”) You can choose any emoji you like. Hover over comments, and you’ll see there are emoji reactions there, too. Sometimes an emoji reaction is better than a comment. Copy and paste formats As well as copying and pasting text and images, you can copy and paste formats, too, which can be handy if you’ve got a heading style (for example) that you want to duplicate multiple times without going into the formatting menus each time. Select any text formatted in the way you want to copy, click the Paint format button on the toolbar (it looks like a paint roller), then select the text you want to apply the format to. The keyboard shortcuts Ctrl + Alt + C (Windows) and Cmd + Option + C (macOS) can also be used to copy a selected format, with Ctrl + Alt + V (Windows) and Cmd + Option + V (macOS) used to paste it. Keep the word count on the screen Even if you’ve found the Word count option on the Tools menu, you might not have noticed the Display word count while typing checkbox on the dialog box. Enable this and you’ll always know exactly how many words you’ve written. Click on the arrow next to the word count box to change it to character or page count instead. Google Docs can do automatic text substitutions, too. Text expansion Select Tools then Preferences , open up the Substitutions tab, and you can tell Google Docs to automatically replace certain bits of typed text with something else, like turning “(C)” into the actual copyright symbol, for example. You can use this feature to create abbreviated shortcuts for sentences you type a lot or to make sure the words you misspell most often are corrected.

"Prof. Alexander Dynkin, at Moscow's Primakov Readings Russia ’s pivot to the  Global South , Western, South and Central Asia is strategic and long-term. While Moscow’s partnership with New Delhi has deep mental and cultural roots, Russia-China ties does not have dimension of a military alliance,  Prof. Alexander Dynkin,  President of IMEMO (Russia’s top think tank) & leading economist tells ET’s Dipanjan Roy Chaudhury ahead of  Primakov Readings  (Russia’s premier foreign policy forum) in Moscow on November 27-28.  This edition of Primakov Readings has special focus on Global South & India. Why did you choose this theme? What is Russia’s view of India’s leadership for the Global South. What is your prediction for bilateral partnership with India  We can say that Europe hasn’t coped with the collapse of the USSR and the Warsaw Pact. This is not the first tragic mistake. From 1701 until 1945, for almost 250 years, the constant Franco-Prussian and then Franco-German wars were the nightmare for European security. Even the First World War did not stop this ""bloody wheel""… But the end of European Security in the 21 st  century doesn’t mean the end of history. There has been a conceptual paradigm shift in international relations in Russia: from the East-West model to the North-South model. No longer from Lisbon to Vladivostok but from Murmansk to Mumbai and from St. Petersburg to Shanghai. From horizontal to vertical, meridian political and economic thinking. We have to comprehend ourselves as a developed North. As a country self-sufficient in such strategic resources as energy, food, raw materials, skilled labor and territory. Achievements in digitalization, nuclear energy, biomedicine and genetics indicate Russia’s leadership in many high technologies. Therefore, we have chosen post-globalization with a focus on the dynamics of relations with the Global South as the topic of the current Primakov Readings. This is geography, mentality, and recognition of the failure of the ideas of the 1990 Paris Charter and the concept of a “common European home”.  As Dr.  Jaishankar , Indian Minister of External Affairs wrote in  the India Way  – it is time for Europeans to understand that European problems are not world problems and world problems are not European ones. India's leadership not only in the Global South, but also in the world was clearly demonstrated during the recent G20 meeting in Delhi. It was the authority of the country and Prime Minister Modi personally that prevented the West from pushing through a confrontational declaration. The friendly relations between Russia and India have a long history. The world's first think tank – the Institute of Oriental Studies was established in St. Petersburg almost 220 years ago. Its research focused on the history, culture, religion and languages of the peoples of India.  In the last century, when independent India thought about creating its own air force, only the USSR offered the latest  MIG-21  jet fighters for that time, along with the transfer of technology for their production. Other countries offered India outdated piston machines.  In turn, in the 1990s, when Russia was going through a severe economic crisis, Indian orders seriously supported our military-industrial complex, especially shipbuilding for the Navy. And today India remains our largest defense customer. In the 21 st  century cooperation continues: from nuclear energy to pharmaceuticals, from space research to genetics and agriculture. Of course, the U.S. has started to pay attention to India relatively recently, about 15 years ago. Before that, in South Asia, they focused on supporting Pakistan. Naturally, India is a sovereign country that chooses its own path. However, it seems to me that what brings Indian and Russian societies together - the well-known priority of the spiritual over the material, the humanistic over the transactional - has deep mental and cultural roots. So far there is no a single Indian media office in Moscow.  Indian society is under radiation from the Anglo-Saxon media. It seems to me that this situation requires some correction. But even the endless narratives that Moscow has become Beijing's puppet, or that Russian armaments are becoming obsolete - face resistance from a qualified Indian reader. Maybe that's why India has not accepted the Western interpretation of the Ukrainian conflict. By taking calculated risks, the country receives pragmatic benefits in the energy and defense sectors. This policy is based on the conclusion that the unipolar architecture of the world order led by the US is fading away. 1.  Over last few years, Moscow’s ties with West Asia and Islamic world have expanded, what is future of this partnership both bilaterally as well as through SCO &  BRICS . + 6. Russia is focusing considerably on expanding its ties with Asia as evident from Primakov Readings. What are your views on this. I think that Russia’s pivot to the Global South, Western, South and Central Asia is strategic and long-term. For 300 years, starting with Peter the Great, Europe has been a role model for Russia. Today, I am convinced, this period is coming to an end. We need to redefine ourselves as a self-sufficient, developed North, a partner of Asia and the Global South, an active participant in the future polycentric world order, which is being formed today not in Europe, but in Asia. On January 1, 2024, the Russian presidency of BRICS-11 will begin. Some experts in the West are trying to present BRICS as a new edition of the  Non-Aligned Movement . I think this is another strategic mistake. This group of countries has a huge aggregate economic power.  In steel production and consumption they account for 70% and 65% respectively. (G7 countries account for 14% and 14% respectively). As for mineral fertilizes the BRICS countries produce 51% and consume 53% of the world level. For food – 57% and 58% respectively. For oil – 44% и 36%. 47% of the world's automotive industry is concentrated in the BRICS countries. It is important to use this potential, which can stop further fragmentation of the world economy. 2.  In the post-Soviet space and Ukraine conflict when some of Russia’s close partners in Eurasia have faced certain dilemma how does Moscow wants to preserve this unique partnership. The collapse of empires is always fraught with protracted territorial conflicts. Indians know this better than many others. The collapse of the British Empire led to the emergence of two nuclear powers. The consequences of the collapse of the Ottoman Empire are still painfully felt in the Middle East. Let's remember Yugoslavia, Kosovo. The same can be said about the USSR.  The Bolsheviks arbitrarily cut the borders of the Russian Empire, without taking into account ethnic or religious factors, in favor of short-term political goals. All post-Soviet countries have been left with national “mines” of delayed action. Some have already exploded: Crimea, Karabakh, Donetsk, Transnistria. There are border problems among the Central Asian republics which are being resolved today, thank God, without much bloodshed. A universal recipe is an attentive attitude to each other's concerns and interests, mutual relief from post–imperial syndromes. 3.  How would you characterize Russia’s partnership with China.  Relations between Russia and China are better today than ever before in history. The dual containment of Russia and China, to which the US policy has slipped, contributes to this. But these relations don’t have the character of a military-political alliance, which the United States is now imposing in the Asia-Pacific region. 4.  You are among leading economists of Russia. What’s your prediction for Russia’s economic growth in near & long term. A market economy is always adaptive. And the Russian economy today is not only diversified, but also equipped with all market institutions. For example, a painful land reform was carried out in our country back in 2001. While in Ukraine - only in 2021, and then under severe pressure from the Western so-called ""benefactors"". It is generally recognized that our labor market is more flexible than in the West. Russia has overcome the pandemic storm better than any other global crisis in post-Soviet history. The crisis of 2020 was already the fourth in the history of modern Russia. During this time, the Government, federal regulators, and the Central Bank have accumulated professional experience. The same can be said about businesses and households. The pandemic has shown that we have a developed and stable domestic market and a stress-resistant banking system, cleared of major problem banks. We have a high level of self-sufficiency in raw materials, energy and food. Our national innovation system was able to be the first to create one of the world's best vaccines. During the pandemic the government acted responsibly and precisely. We were able to pass this stress test without ""helicopter money"" and not react to the panic on the oil markets when the price went into negative values. This is evidence of the maturity of Russia's market economy, the professionalism of the Cabinet of Ministers and top management of corporations. For example, in one year, oil companies made a dramatic redirection of export flows. If in 2021 crude oil exports went to Europe by almost 100%, then by the end of 2022 – by 80% to Asian markets. This saved not only the oil industry, but also the federal budget of 2022. If we talk about sectors since 2014, agriculture, food production and manufacturing have been included in the import substitution sphere. The success in the first two sectors is evident. Today, without canceling efforts in the manufacturing industry, the focus of industrial policy is shifting to services: primarily medicine, education, and tourism. These approaches are based on large-scale digitalization and AI: taxes, customs, all types of government, banking and educational services, issue labeling. This not only improves efficiency, eases demographic constraints, but also reduces white-collar corruption.  Macro policy instruments are also undergoing another anti-crisis transformation: budget rules have been relaxed, the fiscal impulse has increased revenues and consequently demand, including credit demand. Economic expectations have improved.  The financial system and its infrastructure are being sovereignized. The innovation is the intention to manage inflation not only through demand compression, but through supply growth and liberalization of entrepreneurship. The task was clearly formulated by the President: ""Containing price growth today is not only the task for the Bank of Russia but also an assessment of the quality of work of the Russian Government on stimulating supply growth"". At the same time and almost manually, the Government conducts deoffshorization - the return of assets of key companies to Russian jurisdiction, to special administrative districts created in advance, or simply put, Russian offshore zones.  At the same time, foreign holdings that acted as intermediaries and asset holders are being closed. All these steps together can be called the Russian version of supply-side economics. What are its preliminary results? The Russian economy by most indicators, including the level of consumption, has returned to the level of the end of 2021. The main economic problems of the Russian Federation remain labor shortages (at full employment) and closed export markets. Nevertheless, Russia is now №1 in Europe in terms of trade with China. China has a trade surplus with 174 countries.  And the deficit is with only 11 countries. Russia is on this second list. According to the latest World Bank estimates, Russia has become one of the five largest economies in the world in terms of GDP by purchasing power parity. And economic growth in 2023-2024 is expected to be close to 3% of GDP, which is almost twice as high as the expectations in developed countries and is in the average global trend.

"TheJames Webb Space Telescope (JWST)has spotted the most distant example of a galaxy in the universe that looks similar to the Milky Way. The galaxy, named ceers-2112, is more than 11.7 billion years old and is the earliest example of a barredspiral galaxyever seen. Astronomers were surprised to see it becausecosmic modelssuggest barred spiral galaxies only started emerging around 6.9 billion years after the Big Bang. The latest discovery, published in the journalNature, could upheave our models of the universe and how dark matter influenced galaxy formation in its early days, study authors said. With its advanced imaging capabilities, JWST has allowed us topeer into the early universewith more precision than ever before. The latest study is no exception. To a layperson, the picture below may look like little more than a colorful blob — and when looking at information coming from the early days of the universe, that's the kind of image that we're usually working with. But with JWST'sprecise measurement instruments, scientists were able to squeeze out crucial information about ceers-2112's characteristics. For them, there is little doubt: this picture suggests this is a barred spiral galaxy. But this galaxy is in redshift 3, a technical term suggesting it appeared about 2 billion years after the birth of the universe That's a conundrum, as a barred spiral galaxy is a very tall order for such a young universe. Previous models had suggested such complex galaxies would take at least a few billion years to evolve. Scientists had thought you couldn't find a barred spiral galaxy before the universe was about6.9 billion years old. ""The discovery of ceers-2112 shows that it can happen in only a fraction of that time, in about one billion years or less,"" Alexander de la Vega, a physicist and cosmologist at the University of California, Riverside, said ina press releaseaccompanying the findings. ""It is the first publication that finds in the childhood of the universe these spiral galaxies that have a disk with a central bar,"" Yetli Rosas Guevara, an astrophysicist of the Spanish Donostia International Physics Center who was not involved in the study, toldEl País. The new finding suggests something is wrong with models predicting what was happening in the early days of the universe. ""In the past, when the universe was very young, galaxies were unstable and chaotic. It was thought that bars could not form or last long in galaxies in the early universe,"" de la Vega said. Simulations ""really struggle to reproduce such systems at those epochs,"" Luca Costantin, study lead author and astrophysicist at the Centro de Astrobiología in Madrid,told Space.com. ""We now need to understand which key physical ingredient is missing in our models — if something is missing,"" Costantin told Space.com. One factor that doesn't quite align is the role of dark matter in theearly daysof galaxy formation. As a reminder, the stuff that makes up everyone on Earth, our planet, our galaxy, and everything we can observe, is ordinary matter, or baryon. But physicists think baryon makes up only 5% of our universe. The other 95% — about 27% ofdark matterand 68% of dark energy — remain huge mysteries in physics. Some models suggest there was an ""over-abundance"" of dark matter in the early days of the universe, study co-author Jairo Abreu, a researcher at the University of La Laguna, told Space.com. But that doesn't quite make sense with the latest findings: barred spiral galaxies are more likely to be made up of baryon, said Abreu. This suggests that ""these models may need to adjust how much dark matter makes up galaxies in the early universe, as dark matter is believed to affect the rate at which bars form,"" said de la Vega.","The galaxy, named ceers-2112, is more than 11.7 billion years old and is the earliest example of a barredspiral galaxyever seen.

"ETtech A protracted funding winter and the pressure to turn a profit are exposing the underbelly of India's startup scene, where the days of lavish perks and extravagant spending are over, said nearly a dozen employees ET spoke to and other industry insiders. Instead, the young, peppy and flexible environment of the new-age firms has made way for a hard performance driven culture, which some say is also “hostile” and “toxic” at times. Elevate Your Tech Prowess with High-Value Skill Courses Offering College Course Website Northwestern University Kellogg Post Graduate Certificate in Product Management Visit Indian School of Business ISB Professional Certificate in Product Management Visit IIM Kozhikode IIMK Advanced Data Science For Managers Visit A 28-year-old product designer at a  fintech  company, who moved with a twofold jump in his salary package in 2021 when startups were on a hiring spree, said: “I didn’t know it actually meant doing the job of two (people). We work with a few clients and partners in the US and most days I work during both Indian and US days.” “I got well above my market rates but it’s very tough to sustain now,” said the young professional who asked not to be named. Some employees claim they are facing rising stress and anxiety levels due to “unrealistic work overload”, “no respect for personal or family time”, “constant threat and fear of job loss”, and “often brash and overbearing culture” within teams. This, they say, is pushing many to desperately pursue other opportunities – though even those are not easy to come by in an otherwise slow job market. “Burnout, stress and missing work-life balance are among the most often stated reasons to look out,” said Prasadh MS, head of workforce research at Xpheno, a specialist staffing firm. The current downturn comes after the dream run of 2021 when startups saw a hiring spree with massive pay packages, lucrative stock options, and exotic perks such as lavish joining kits, outings and weekend parties, health club memberships, and mindfulness and meditation sessions to attract and retain top talent. Discover the stories of your interest Blockchain 5 Stories Cyber-safety 7 Stories Fintech 9 Stories E-comm 9 Stories ML 8 Stories Edtech 6 Stories A 30-year-old software engineer at a consumer  tech startup  says: “My wife and I work in different startups. We have been planning to start a family but had to deal with two miscarriages. It’s a lot of stress.” For some it was like a mirage created by a 3-4X jump in pay, which prompted them to take on heavy loan burdens and forced them to continue in their current jobs despite the heavy work pressure. “It turned out to be a financial trap,” says a 28-year-old data analyst at a consumer tech company. “Time for self is lost…The culture is toxic and impacts my health.” “The funding winter has created a strain on profitability, leading to a challenging work environment for employees,” said Ashish Sanganeria, senior partner at  Transearch , a global executive search firm. Many have also made themselves expensive outliers with their above-market compensation packages. “Many candidates get filtered out on the role budget front,” said Prasadh. “Some candidates are even open to taking a lower package to get stability and a balanced workplace.” However, while on one hand, employees complain of rising stress, startups too are facing intense pressure from boards and investors to improve operating efficiencies and make profits. “Startups are always optimising to retain their best performing team members, and the time frame to demonstrate wins is always tightening…so yes, it is a challenging category to work in,” said Pranav Pai, managing partner at 3one4 Capital, a venture capital firm. Concurred Ankur Pahwa, managing partner of venture capital fund PeerCapital: “During the funding winter, startups often focus on cost optimization and efficiency, influencing HR practices and hence culture.” “In many cases, the pressure may not be intentionally created, it may be because the startups themselves are in a survival mode.” “2021 saw several candidates shopping around, demanding non-standard pay scales, and many times not showing up after accepting an offer. Employers still have unpleasant memories of this behaviour, and this will definitely be top of mind during this correction. Most companies have stopped tolerating excessive spending or unprofessional behaviour, especially during recruitment,” added Pai. Pahwa, however, admitted that it is crucial to recognize that there’s a limit to how much work pressure an individual can endure, and surpassing that point can lead to a psychological breakdown. Psychologists say there has been an increase in the number of youngsters seeking counselling with symptoms of stress and relationship issues. “Across our client and partner portfolio, the past year has seen an increasing number of startup team members seeking support for their mental health,” said Amit Malik, founder and CEO of mental health organisation Amaha.

"hangzhou, china :     india's modest olympic achievements have long stood in contrast to its massive population but sporting officials say the sleeping giant has stirred at the asian games. five years ago at the continental showpiece in jakarta, india finished eighth on the medal table with their best ever haul of 70 medals, including 16 golds. in hangzhou, team india soared past 80 medals on wednesday with four days' competition to spare, soaking up glowing reports in national media and praise from prime minister narendra modi. after being topped by the likes of taiwan, uzbekistan and indonesia in jakarta, india were fourth on the medal table on thursday behind the dependable top three of china, japan and south korea. with 45 nations, the asian games offers far weaker competition than the olympics and features plenty of medals in sports that have little prospect of making the olympic programme. india managed seven medals, including one gold, at the tokyo olympics, the nation's record haul only putting them 48th on the table. positive trajectory yet the trajectory is positive and results in hangzhou show that increased funding and more targeted sports investment in recent years is paying dividends, india team officials told reuters. ""it’s because of our prime minister (is) wishing that india should become a sporting power, so the government is doing incentives and coaching and (using) foreign coaches,"" indian olympic association (ioa) president p.t. usha said. ""the government is doing it in a systematic way. ""that system started three, four years ago. but it is good now. we started getting the results now."" indian athletics has made strides in hangzhou, claiming 29 medals, nine better than jakarta. athletes have surprised in a number of events, including kishore jena, who took javelin silver behind team mate neeraj chopra, the country's first olympic and world champion in track and field. the men's 4x400m relay team cruised to victory on wednesday, after an eye-catching world championships in budapest where they set a new asian record on the way to a fifth place finish in the final. ""these are healthy signs of an emergent asian sports power,"" said nandan kamath, a sports lawyer who was involved in drafting the indian government’s target olympic podium scheme which provides funding to athletes. ""there has been consolidation and growth in disciplines like shooting and athletics and the emergence of winners and contenders in new disciplines."" india have a long way to go to catch up with china and have no hope of doing so in hangzhou, where the hosts are closing in on their record haul of 199 gold medals from guangzhou in 2010. but there is no shortage of optimism. ""in the near future definitely we will chase china,"" india chef de mission bhupender singh bajwa told reuters. he added that the team were targeting double their tokyo olympics medal haul at paris next year. while the athletes have broken new ground for india in recent years, sports governance in the nation has had less encouraging results. just over a year ago, the international olympic committee (ioc) threatened to ban the ioa from olympic games if it were unable to solve governance and election issues. ioc chief thomas bach has nonetheless talked up india as having a strong case to host the 2036 olympics. india has yet to hold formal discussions with the ioc about bidding but sports minister anurag thakur said the country is considering one. with india hosting the next ioc session in mumbai from oct. 15, a potential 2036 bid may well be a hot topic in the wake of the nation's success in hangzhou.

"Sir Patrick Vallance, the government's chief scientific adviser when the pandemic started in 2020, has been giving evidence at the public inquiry into Covid on Monday. Sir Patrick recorded his thoughts most evenings as handwritten notes, saying they were a ""form of release"" which helped him focus on the next day's challenges. When he appeared in the inquiry's first phase he described them as a ""brain dump"" and argued that they should not be made public in full as they were never intended for public consumption. Those notes have been handed over in full to the inquiry's legal team, and about 25 short extracts have already been read in open court when other witnesses were being questioned. The first entry from his diaries we know about so far comes from May 2020, and focuses on the debate around how to release lockdown restrictions.  Sir Patrick was responsible for chairing the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), a committee of scientists, mainly from academia, responsible for advising ministers on Covid. But his diary reveals he is concerned about the ""following the science"" mantra coming from the government.  In another entry he worries that scientists are being used as ""human shields"". He writes: ""Ministers try to make the science give the answers rather than them making decisions. ""I am [worried] that a 'Sage is trouble' vibe is appearing in No 10.  ""Some person has completely rewritten the science advice as though it is the definitive version. They have just cherry picked. Quite extraordinary..."" Boris Johnson's special adviser Dominic Cummings (DC) is giving his press conference in the Downing Street Rose garden after the Mirror and Guardian newspapers reveal he has travelled to Barnard Castle, near Durham, during lockdown.  Sir Patrick writes: ""PM seems very bullish and wants to have everything released sooner and more extremely than we would.  ""Wants to divert from the DC fiasco (caught have gone [sic] to Durham - clearly against the rules).  ""All very worrying. Cabinet all upbeat and 'breezy confidence' - incredibly alarming.  ""It was another rambling opening to Cabinet. Quite extraordinary.""  On the same day, Sir Patrick's diaries reveal that he and Prof Sir Chris Whitty do not like the idea of taking part in a daily news conference, as they know they will be asked about Mr Cummings.  Sir Patrick says communications chiefs Lee Cain and James Slack plus civil servant Martin Reynolds tried to convince them, but they managed to avoid doing it in the end. ""Chris and I not at all keen to do the press conference.  ""All highly political and dwarfed by DC.  ""We tried to get out of it by suggesting that it was not the right day to announce new measures and that this would undermine our credibility.""  Sir Patrick makes diary notes on the decision to move to step 4 of the roadmap for releasing lockdown restrictions, which removed all legal limits on socialising and life events as the school year ended (announced on 12 July).  He is getting frustrated around this time with the inconsistency in Mr Johnson's decision-making. He writes: ""PM cancelled the big announcement and has gone more cautious (for now).  ""Simon Case taking one day at a time. PM is simply not consistent (as he wasn't at the beginning)."" Sir Patrick notes that Mr Johnson is increasingly convinced the economy needs to be kept open, because it is mainly older people who are being affected by Covid. He writes: ""PM WhatsApp group kicks off because PM has read in FT that the IFR [infection fatality rate] is 0.04%.  ""Age-related IFR explained and that overall looks more like 0.4 to 1%.  ""He is obsessed with older people accepting their fate and letting the young get on with life and the economy going.  ""Quite a bonkers set of exchanges."" By this point, Sage's scientific advisers have been pressing for tougher restrictions as Covid cases start to rise sharply.  New measures (rule of six, then tiers) are brought in, but there is no full lockdown until 5 November.  He writes: ""Very bad meeting in No.10...  ""PM talks of Medieval measures than ones being suggested.  ""Perhaps we should look at another approach and apply different values.  ""Surely this just sweeps through in waves like other natural phenomena and there is nothing we can do.  ""As Simon Ridley said final slide, PM said, 'Whisky and a revolver.' He was all over the place.""  Sir Patrick writes: ""PM meeting - begins to argue for letting it all rip. Saying yes there will be more casualties but so be it - 'they have had a good innings'. ""Not persuaded by Edmonds, Ferguson, Farrar [scientists on emergency advisory group].  ""PM saying 'the population just has to behave doesn't it!'.  ""PM getting very frustrated - throwing papers down. PM back on to 'Most people who die have reached their time anyway'.""  We do not know the context around Sir Patrick's first entry on this day. ""The right-wing press are culpable & we have a weak indecisive PM."" The following month is a chaotic time in Downing Street as Mr Cain and then Mr Cummings leave their roles amid rumours of clashes with Mr Johnson's then-fiancee Carrie Symonds. Sir Patrick did not always agree with England's chief medical officer (CMO) Sir Chris on how strict social restrictions should be to manage rising case numbers. While the CMO thought the public would rebel against rules, Sir Patrick was keen to introduce them earlier. In this day's diary entry, he writes: ""CMO again talks about going 'too early' and losing people. Is he really right about this? I think we need to go sooner and harder.""  It would be a mistake to think all of the diary entries paint Mr Johnson as resisting tougher Covid rules.  Here, in mid-November, he is, apparently, the one pushing for harder action. ""PM is the only rational voice in the political side [ ... ]  ""PM - arguing for going harder and says, 'More jobs will go if this thing takes off again'.""  By now the UK has a vaccine against Covid-19. In this entry, the first line refers to a plan to vaccinate 15 million people by 15 February.  He writes: ""PM says 15M Vx Feb 15, 20M March 1st, April 30M & by then we must do something.  ""Says he wants Tier 3 March 1, Tier 2 April 1, & Tier 1 May 1st & nothing by September ... ends by saying the team must bring in the 'pro death squad' from HMT."" Mention of the ""pro death squad"" at the Treasury is a reference to the fact they are the ones pushing for opening up quickly. Mr Johnson wanted complete unlocking with no remaining restrictions by September.","Sir Patrick recorded his thoughts most evenings as handwritten notes. He said they were a ""form of release"" which helped him focus on the next day. When he appeared in the inquiry's first phase he described them as a ""brain dump"" He argued that they should not be made public in full as they were never intended for public consumption.

"PRESS RELEASENovember 16, 2023, 8:00am CET 2023 THIRD-QUARTER BUSINESS The Parrot group, European leader for professional microdrones, recorded €15.1m of consolidated revenues in the third quarter of 2023, down -31% from the third quarter of 2022, which represented a high basis for comparison. For the first nine months of 2023, consolidated revenues show a year-on-year contraction of -11%. This level of business is in line with the guidance published on October 4, 2023, following deferrals of significant microdrone equipment orders or deliveries to the first half of 2024. * Q3 2022 revenues also included €0.5m generated by the legacy consumer products. Professional microdrones business The professional microdrones business generated €8.0m of revenues, representing 53% of Group revenues (-42% at constant exchange rates). Revenues for the third quarter of 2022 included significant deliveries for defense and security institutions, as well as €0.5m of legacy consumer product sales and €1.1m of non-recurring controller sales. Looking beyond the slowdown linked to the general economic climate, the level of business does not reflect the robust commercial development of ANAFI USA, with order renewals received from major clients and particularly defense forces in France, Finland, Belgium and Luxembourg, as well as a significant contribution by various American federal agencies. This is illustrated by the limited contraction of -9% for ANAFI USA sales this quarter. The sustained level of tenders is being supported by the launch of new drone programs in certain countries, with significant ambitions for growth from the first half of 2024. Photogrammetry business The photogrammetry business generated €7.1m of revenues, representing 47% of Group revenues (-9% at constant exchange rates). Over the period, in a context in which many sectors are slowing down their investments, sales of the seven most recent business solutions and related accessories were not yet sufficient to offset the gradual downturn in sales of legacy solutions. Sales are expected to improve in the fourth quarter. In addition, the effective savings measures rolled out are expected to enable operations to break even from the last quarter of 2023. Outlook The Group is able to confirm the outlook for 2023 published on October 4, 2023, with full-year consolidated revenues of at least €60m for 2023, compared with €71.9m in 2022, down by around 16%, taking into account the Group’s two business lines (photogrammetry solutions and microdrones). During the second quarter of 2023, the Group rolled out various measures to reduce its cash consumption pending an expected significant upturn in growth in the first half of 2024.

"New Zealand plans to scrap its landmark smoking ban for young generations. This policy was thought to have inspired Prime Minister Rishi Sunak to introduce similar smoking restrictions in the UK.  While New Zealand's U-turn may lead to a set back for anti-smoking campaigns globally, there are still several countries getting ever tougher on tobacco. Here's what you need to know about global efforts to quit smoking.  Under the UK government's proposed legislation, anyone aged 14 or under will never be able to legally buy cigarettes or any other tobacco product. The idea is to prevent future generations from smoking, as nine in 10 people say they started the habit before the age of 21, according to data from Cancer Research. The proposed law will not criminalise the act of buying tobacco and won't prevent anyone currently older than 14 from being sold tobacco in future. New Zealand's previous government wanted to have a sweeping crackdown on smoking, passing a law which meant anyone born after 2008 would not be able to buy cigarettes or tobacco products in their lifetime. They also restricted where tobacco could be sold and reduced the level of nicotine (the addictive drug) in cigarettes. But, the new government (voted in from October 2023) are moving to repeal the law, saying it would help fund tax cuts.  Mexico has some of the strictest anti-smoking laws in the world, including smoking bans at beaches, parks and in some cases private homes. Portugal aims to have a ""smoke-free generation"" by 2040, and wants to pass a law that would stop bars, cafes and petrol stations from selling tobacco products. Canada is hoping to reduce tobacco use to less than 5% by 2035 and earlier this year, became the first country to rule that health warnings should be printed on individual cigarettes.  According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), over one quarter of the world's population are covered by complete smoking bans in public places, workplaces and public transport. In 2007, just 10 countries had ""smoke-free policies"". Today, it is 74. Ireland was the first country in the world to ban smoking in all indoor workplaces in 2004, including restaurants and bars. In 2006, Uruguay became the first country in the region to adopt a ""100% smoke-free national policy,"" says WHO. Measures included a ban on smoking in all enclosed public places and restrictions in some outdoor areas such as near hospitals and schools. In 2020, Paraguay became the last country in the region to pass national laws to create ""smoke-free environments"" - meaning its citizens can only use tobacco products in specific uncrowded open air spaces. The European Commission said there was a problem with getting people and authorities to actually follow anti-smoking measures in reality, with laws on paper often being ignored. Greece, Hungary, Ireland, the Netherlands, Romania and Spain have ""strong"" enforcement, according to Smoke Free Partnership, a group of European NGOs. However Cyprus, Czech Republic, Latvia, Poland and Slovakia are among countries that have limited protections, and even these are sometimes ignored. The 2006 Health Act put an end to smoking in ""enclosed or substantially enclosed"" spaces - meaning workplaces, bars, restaurants or public transport became spaces free from smoke. In 2014, the Children and Families Act restricted smoking in cars carrying children. Today, smoking rates in the UK are at their lowest on record, according to government. However, 6.4 million adults are still smokers.  By Rosemary McCabe","New Zealand plans to scrap its landmark smoking ban for young generations.

"ETMarkets.com Sanjiv Bhasin , Director,  IIFL Securities , says in the microfinance space, AU Small Finance deserves a relook. It was trading below Rs 700. I gave that as one of my Diwali picks at Rs 670, 680. They are progressing very well on their digital apps. Then, look at AB Capital, that is another NBFC which has progressed very smartly and the sum of the parts it has got all the holding companies and the digital app, which they have recently launched, is doing extremely well.”  Let us begin by discussing TCS itself. The entire IT space is in a bit of a tumble. This entire buyback news and the record date is finally out. It is November 25th. What would be your recommendation to retail investors? Should they participate in the buyback given it is at 20% premium to current market price? This is the fifth buyback by TCS. In the last three years and each time you have given it and not bought it back, you have lost out on the opportunity of another 50% upside. It started from Rs 2,300 or Rs 2,500 and it has gone to Rs 4,500 which tells you that the company is extremely confident on a slightly longer term.  I would definitely recommend that make use of this arbitrage but do not let go of this blue chip because if we can see the underlying sea change, it is telling us that bond yields and inflation may be past their peak and if spending comes back which is very much on the card, then IT will be again in a sweet spot. Plus it is a good alibi to a weak rupee and TCS is the greatest wealth creator of all time. I still think one should participate in the buyback but please buy back your shares because you do not know when the next buyback comes and for small petty gains, you lose out on a big blue chip. Stay invested and make use of this arbitrage. Unlock Leadership Excellence with a Range of CXO Courses Offering College Course Website Indian School of Business ISB Chief Digital Officer Visit IIM Kozhikode IIMK Chief Product Officer Programme Visit IIM Lucknow IIML Chief Marketing Officer Programme Visit   What should one do with Bajaj Finance? This news has come in as a bit of a shocker but, of course, the company has been delivering stellar returns both in terms of stock prices as well as earnings performance. Should one buy into the knee-jerk reaction that we will see today? If you see the underlying numbers also, it is just 2- 3% of the entire EMI loans or the cards which they have. We will get more clarity from the management over a period of time. But if I am correct, then it is how fast these KFT’s recommendations can be implemented, that may take maybe one quarter, but I would definitely think that that will be very fastly adhered to by the company. This company has stood for two things – one is growth and being innovative and second is quality of management which is unprecedented. So, this was really a shot in the blue but a large part of that will have been addressed by the management and given that this is an opportunity to get into the largest NBFC, I would use this decline to add on to this stock.   Anything from midcap IT? A brokerage is calling KPIT amongst the best within the  midcap IT  arena. Clearly,  largecaps  are not performing. Anything within  midcaps  that you like? I have liked Persistent from Rs 3,600-3,700 level. It is at Rs 6,600, an all-time high. I still think that company is a must-have in your portfolio. It has been included in the MSCI indexes. Coforge is another stock which has no promoter holding and that could be a dark horse. But we want to remain with three names, Persistent, HCL Tech and Tech Mahindra. HCL Tech and Tech Mahindra among the largecaps are giving enough comfort on the valuation and the road forward. These two stocks can be a far better player than any other name.  You Might Also Like: It is time the elephant started to dance; Bank Nifty to outperform: Sanjiv Bhasin In the whole IT underperformance, midcaps have been far better performers, if you just took the case of Persistent. So, Coforge is one name which we would go with. But like I said, there is a plethora of other stocks or opportunities. The recent case is Bajaj Finance. One observation which has a 3% impact on the overall revenues is going to cause some chaos and that is the opportunity you must look to buy.   The entire microfinance space has been reporting very strong numbers. There is this entire wave of new tech-based apps that we have seen and these microlenders are tapping into the digital data to pass through to their clients as well. Which names come to your mind? AU Small Finance deserves a relook. It was trading below Rs 700. I gave that as one of my Diwali picks at Rs 670, 680. They are progressing very well on their digital apps. Then, look at AB Capital, that is another NBFC which has progressed very smartly and the sum of the parts it has got all the holding companies and the digital app, which they have recently launched, is doing extremely well.  After Bajaj Finance, you will find that AB Capital is making very much inroads into the small loan category and the MSME space, so that is one stock I would keep an eye out on. As a disclosure, this is another stock which we have in our portfolio ever since it was Rs 120 and we think that this is a very big wealth creator over a period of time as sum of parts of some of its holding companies and the new-age business which they are into.   Anything within the insurance space that you like? There are hotter sectors in the market to bet on, but particularly this. You must see that there are three distribution channels. One is insurance, the other is AMC, the third is exchanges and fourth is brokerages and brokerage stocks have been through the roof. As a disclosure, we are also sitting on stock options in our company and we think that that is the way forward because these are conduits which are going to make money irrespective of where the markets are.  You Might Also Like: Sanjiv Bhasin on 5 stocks to bet on in Samvat 2080 Insurance is a no-brainer in the sense that private insurers are getting a very big chunk and their AP is only rising over a period of time. So, three names, SBI Life, ICICI Pru, and HDFC Life all in tandem could be very, very good wealth creators over a period of time and I still think this distribution channel, particularly brokers, exchanges, insurance and the AMCs are a very good long-term bet, given that the conversion of financial savings into equity and other products is very much a long-term process.   What is your take within the capital goods space? Would you go for the likes of L&T which also has an infrastructure theme or ABB, Siemens and manufacturing kind of names? We like two names. One is Cummins, the other is Bharat Forge. Third is Thermax. L&T is in our portfolio. We are not increasing weightage. We will try and participate in the buyback for whatever it is. But L&T is a core holding of our portfolio. These three names are something which we would bet on. As for Siemens, I would say, let this whole imbroglio of the energy part getting split and so on get demerged, play out because that would put some cap on the upside since there are people who want to exit. But Cummins, Thermax, Bharat Forge and L&T are four of the choicest names. You can add an ABB.

"European Commission Speech4 November 2023Kyiv Dear First Lady, Dear Olena, Ladies and Gentlemen, What a pleasure to be here with you today. Indeed, Ukraine is still going through very dark times, more than 600 days since the start of this brutal war that Russia unleashed against Ukraine. But today is about hope. Today is about the future. Today is about the children. Indeed, I remember very well, a year ago, when we met in Strasbourg, dear Olena, you asked me to help to alleviate the plight of Ukrainian children, whose schools had been destroyed by Russian bombs. And with their schools gone,  their world crumbled. And I knew indeed that the European Union had to do something about it and help these children go to other schools, so they could continue learning and playing, and they could continue being children even in these difficult times. So, we had discussed: Why not call on the solidarity of our Member States, and our regions, cities and companies? The response was overwhelming. I was certain that they would respond, but it was amazing to see how fast and how jubilant they were to respond immediately. A year on now, here we are. The 'School Buses for Ukraine' campaign is a big success. Local authorities and companies from everywhere in our Union donated 271 buses. We, as you have seen in the little video, the European Commission, took care of bringing them to Ukraine and we bought another 100 school buses. So altogether, today, we are at 371 school buses to take the children of Ukraine to school, safely. The Russian war may have robbed them of the innocence of childhood, but it will not deprive the children of a bright and happy future they deserve. I thank each and everyone here in the room who contributed to this success. The future should start here today, with all of you. And I thank you very much for your contribution. This is a very special day.","""Today is about hope. Today is about the future,"" he said.

"Iran Press TV Saturday, 18 November 2023 8:40 AM Fighters from the Lebanese resistance movement Hezbollah have intercepted and shot down an Israeli unmanned aerial vehicle while it was hovering over an area in southern part of Lebanon close to the border between the Arab country and the 1948 Israeli-occupied territories. Hezbollah said in a brief statement carried by Lebanon's Arabic-language al-Manar television network that it downed an Israeli Elbit Hermes 450 unmanned aerial vehicle early on Saturday morning. The statement added the Israeli aircraft was brought down with a surface-to-air missile, and it fell in the Galilee Panhandle area in the northern sector of the Israeli-occupied lands. The development came hours after Israeli warplanes and artillery units struck the outskirts of the Lebanese border towns of al-Jebbayn, al-Labbouneh, Aitaroun, Yarine, Dhaira, Mays al-Jabal, Blida Houla, Tayr Harfa, Aita al-Shaab, Rab Tlatine, al-Taybe, Rmeish, and Wadi Mozlem. Israel had overnight shelled al-Naqoura, Blida, al-Khiam, Borj al-Moulouk, Kfarshouba, and Kfarhamam areas with heavy and flare shells. Hezbollah, for its part, targeted a group of Israeli soldiers near al-Taihat and other groups of soldiers near al-Marj post, the Ramim barracks, al-Dhaira, and Yir'on, inflicting casualties. It also targeted the Malkia post. Israeli medics later announced that they transported four wounded Israeli soldiers from the Manara post, one of whom was critically wounded. Hezbollah has warned that it will join the Palestinian resistance group Hamas and its allies in the fight against Israel if the regime escalates its aggression on Gaza and in case foreign military forces intervene to help the Israeli regime in the battle. Hezbollah's Secretary General Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah said on November 2 that the Lebanese resistance movement entered the battle against Israel on October 8, a day after Gaza-based Palestinian resistance movements launched their surprise attack, Operation al-Aqsa Storm, against the regime.

"And there it goes. The astronaut tool bag that floated away during the most recent extravehicular activity outside the International Space Station (ISS) appears as a tiny white speck in this new astronomical image. The Virtual Telescope Project released an image of the ISS crew lock bag in orbit after it was misplaced by spacewalking astronauts on November 1. The image was captured on Wednesday using a single 2-second exposure by one of the facility’s robotic telescopes located in Manciano, Italy.  The telescope tracked and spotted the runaway bag as it was zooming through Earth orbit at speeds reaching 17,500 miles per hour (28,000 kilometers per hour). The robotic telescope needed to move quickly to track the object as it flew across the sky. In the image, it looks like a lonely dot amidst the vast emptiness of space, surrounded only with faint streaks of light from a few surrounding stars. The tool bag was lost during a spacewalk by astronauts Jasmin Moghbeli and Loral O’Hara outside the ISS, and it accidentally floated out of reach. Like the ISS, it now orbits the Earth, and at a similar velocity. This space oopsie was tracked and cataloged as a +6th magnitude object, which is just slightly below the limit of visibility to the unaided eye, according to EarthSky. The orbiting tools will likely remain in orbit for a few months before losing altitude and disintegrating in Earth’s atmosphere. In its current orbit, the bag doesn’t pose a threat to the ISS or the astronauts on board.

"People's Daily Online (Xinhua) 09:23, November 19, 2023 BEIJING, Nov. 18 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Saturday briefed the media on Chinese President Xi Jinping's talks with U.S. President Joe Biden and his attendance at the 30th APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting in San Francisco. Wang, also a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, said that it is widely believed that President Xi's trip has attracted worldwide attention, which has added stability to the China-U.S. relations, brought new impetus to the Asia-Pacific cooperation and injected positive energy into the international and regional landscape. President Xi pointed out in San Francisco, China and the United States should assume a new vision, noting that the two countries should jointly develop a right perception, jointly manage disagreements effectively and appreciate each other's principles and red lines, jointly advance mutually beneficial cooperation, jointly shoulder responsibilities as major countries and jointly promote people-to-people exchanges, said Wang, adding that this has built together five pillars for China-U.S. relations and established the ""San Francisco vision"" oriented toward the future. Reaffirming the five commitments he made at the Bali summit, President Biden said that the United States does not seek a new Cold War, it does not seek to change China's system, it does not seek to revitalize alliances against China, it does not support ""Taiwan independence,"" and that it has no intention to have a conflict with China, Wang said. Thanks to the joint efforts of both sides, more than 20 important results have been achieved in the meeting, including the establishment of a working group on counternarcotics cooperation and the agreement to resume, on the basis of equality and respect, high-level communication and institutional dialogue between the two militaries, and to jointly promote the success of the 28th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP28) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Dubai, Wang said. Wang said that the San Francisco summit meeting stands as a major event in the history of China-U.S. relations as well as in international relations, and is conducive to advancing their relationship in the direction of healthy, stable and sustainable development. Meanwhile, Wang called on the two sides to be soberly aware that the China-U.S. relationship has never been smooth sailing. There are still many deep-seated and structural problems, and many risks and challenges that need to be addressed jointly, he said, noting that San Francisco should not be the finish line but a new starting point. During the visit, President Xi was invited to a welcome dinner jointly hosted by friendly organizations in the United States, during which he delivered an important speech, stressing that the foundation of China-U.S. relations was laid by our peoples, the door of China-U.S. relations was opened by our peoples, the stories of China-U.S. relations are written by our peoples, and the future of China-U.S. relations will be created by our peoples, Wang said. President Xi's cordial interactions once again with friendly personages from all walks of life in the United States made us feel deeply that the foundation of China-U.S. friendship is still there, the momentum of exchanges remains and the prospect of cooperation is promising, he added. President Xi made an in-depth review of the inspiration from the course of Asia-Pacific cooperation, pointing out that openness and inclusiveness are the defining feature of Asia-Pacific cooperation, development for all is the overarching goal of Asia-Pacific cooperation and seeking common ground while shelving differences is the best practice of Asia-Pacific cooperation. On how to build the next ""golden 30 years"" in Asia Pacific, President Xi called for innovation-driven, open, green development, and inclusive development that delivers benefits to all. He also called for high-quality growth to promote the building of an Asia-Pacific community with a shared future so that the fruits of modernization are widely shared. Wang said that during the visit, President Xi delivered a written speech to the APEC CEO Summit, and on many occasions extensively and intensively introduced the essence and world significance of Chinese modernization to all sectors in the United States and APEC participants. President Xi pointed out that China's economy has been steadily recovering and turning for the better, and its growth rate is among the highest among major economies of the world, Wang said, adding that China remains the most powerful engine of global growth. President Xi stressed that China's resolve to foster a market-oriented, law-based and world-class business environment will not change, and China's policy of providing equal and quality services to foreign investors will not change, Wang noted. He said that the attitude sends a strong signal of China's high-level opening-up and boosts the confidence of all parties in continuing cooperation with China.","Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi briefed media on Chinese President Xi Jinping's talks with U.S. President Joe Biden.

"PARIS --A French bishop has been given a preliminary charge of attempting to rape an adult man a decade ago, the Paris prosecutor’s office said Monday. It is the latest of a growing number of accusations of sexual abuse by clergy inFrance. The Bishops' Conference of France said the accused bishop, Georges Colomb, contests the charge and deserves the presumption of innocence. He has asked the Vatican to step aside from his duties as bishop of La Rochelle and Saintes in western France to prepare his defense. French investigative website Mediapart reported that senior figures in the Catholic Church were aware of the accusations for years. The allegations didn't reach prosecutors until May of this year. That's when lawyers for the Archdiocese of Paris and a Catholic group called the Foreign Missions of Paris, shortened to MEP in French, submitted a report of a rape attempt by Colomb in 2013, according to the prosecutor’s office. Colomb headed the MEP from 2010 to 2016, and his accuser was staying in MEP facilities at the time of the incident, according to French media reports. Colomb became a bishop in 2016. As a result of the ensuing investigation, Colomb was detained for questioning last week and magistrates filed a preliminary charge on Friday, the prosecutor’s office said. Colomb is under judicial supervision and barred from contact with the victim or witnesses pending further investigation. His accuser has not been publicly named. After the alleged rape attempt, the man spoke about what happened to another official in the MEP, Gilles Reithinger. Reithinger told public broadcaster France-3 that the man said Colomb proposed an oil massage that made him uncomfortable but didn’t mention any sexual wrongdoing. Reithinger, now bishop of Strasbourg, said he raised the issue with Colomb’s superior at the time but didn’t see any reason to report the incident to prosecutors. The bishops' conference said in a statement Monday that it expresses its concern for the alleged victim, and offered support for ‘’all those who are troubled or hurt by this news.’’ A lawyer for Colomb did not respond to request for comment. France is coming to terms with decades of covered-up abuse by church-related figures amid a global reckoning over the issue. France’s bishops’ conference agreed to provide reparations after a 2021 report estimated some 330,000 children were sexually abused over 70 years by priests or other church-related figures in the country. The estimates were based on broader research by France’s National Institute of Health and Medical Research into sexual abuse of children.","The Bishops' Conference of France said the accused bishop, Georges Colomb, contests the charge.

"Biden administration ‘doing everything we possibly can’ to free captives, official quoted as saying. The administration of United States President Joe Biden has said that securing the release of the more than 240 captives held by Hamas will require a “very significant pause” in fighting in Gaza. “It is something that is under a very serious and active discussion. But there is no agreement as of yet to actually get this done,” a senior Biden administration official was quoted as saying by multiple news agencies on Friday. The official, who spoke to journalists on condition of anonymity, said Washington was “doing everything we possibly can” to get the captives out of Gaza, including “indirect engagement”. “We’re hopeful and doing everything we possibly can to get the hostages out, but there’s absolutely no guarantee, a – that it is going to happen, or b – when it’s going to happen,” the official was quoted as saying. The official’s remarks came afterIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Friday ruled out any temporary ceasefireuntil Hamas releases all captives, following a meeting with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken in Tel Aviv. Pushing back against Blinken’s call for “humanitarian pauses” to protect civilians and allow aid into the besieged enclave, Netanyahu said Israel would continue “full force” until all captives go free. The Biden administration has been in constant discussion with Israel and “asking hard questions” about its objectives and whether it was achieving them, the official was quoted as saying. Hamas, which governs Gaza, killed more than 1,400 people and took more than 240 others captive during its October 7 attacks on southern Israel, according to Israeli officials. Many of the captives are believed to still be in Gaza, which has been under intense bombardment by Israeli forces for almost a month. The Biden official was also quoted as saying that Hamas provided a list of injured Palestinians for evacuation, but it was deemed to be “unacceptable” by the US, Israel and Egypt as one-third of the names were Hamas members.

"NOGALES, Arizona --Senior government officials are concerned that Congress may not pass enough funding to secure the border, as federal authorities work under immense pressure to stop illegal narcotics smuggling. ABC News took an exclusive look at ground zero for the fight against one particularly deadly drug: fentanyl. Southern Arizona has become a massive corridor for trafficking the synthetic opioid with nearly half of all border seizures occurring at federal checkpoints in the state. At the Mariposa Port of Entry in Nogales, Arizona, U.S. Customs and Border Protection Acting Commissioner Troy Miller told ABC News his front-line officers are in dire need of more technology, manpower and the tools to improve incoming cargo detection.  ""The headline here is we need additional resources to continue our fight against fentanyl,"" Miller said. ABC News observed the critical balancing act performed by customs officers responsible for catching drugs while facilitating the flow of legitimate commercial trade -- about $4 trillion worth annually.  ""It's very challenging,"" Miller said. ""It's certainly very challenging as we see the seizures go up year after year. But I can say, as we organize and we're going after these ruthless criminals that are killing American citizens, all of our partners are focused on this particular fight."" Using X-ray scanning technology, drug sniffing dogs and classic detective experience, CBP is seizing 860% more fentanyl compared to 2019. But with more than 100,000 people dying from drug overdoses last year, officials say they believe there is more work to be done. Fentanyl has been linked to the majority of overdose deaths in the U.S., according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The synthetic opioid is 50 times stronger than heroin and 100 times stronger than morphine, according to the CDC. The Biden administration has requested $14 billion from Congress for border security as part of a larger supplemental funding proposal that ties together aid for Israel and Ukraine. But Republicans are refusing to offer support unless the Biden administration can reduce the historically high levels of illegal migration seen in recent years. ""The continuing chaos at the Southwest border is ultimately a policy-driven crisis, not a resource-driven one,"" Republican Rep. Mark Green, chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee said in a statement. ""I will not support a dime of this request until President [Joe] Biden and Secretary [Alejandro] Mayorkas take substantive steps to reverse the policies that have sparked and maintained this crisis.""  The Biden administration continues to walk a fraught line between tough enforcement measures at the border and providing lawful humanitarian support for migrants. Complicating the effort is the work of cartel organizations that operate internationally. Across the border from Nogales, the notorious Sinaloa cartel unofficially controls much of the territory, Miller said. Law enforcement officers say they believe the same criminal organizations that route drugs up to the border are also responsible for human smuggling. ""I think right now it is extremely important we continue to go after the transnational criminal organizations that are trafficking fentanyl, that are taking advantage of the world's most vulnerable people and making money off those individuals,"" Miller said. The agency is working to install 34 new X-ray scanning machines to help catch and seize illegal drugs coming in to the U.S. There are plans to install more than150 with enough funding. Further complicating law enforcement's efforts is a looming government shutdown. While much of the border work force will be required to work without pay, concerns about the impact on morale and recruitment efforts remain. ""I'm not in the business of predicting anything,"" Miller said. ""The men and women of U.S. Customs and Border Protection are going to be working whether there's a government shutdown or not, and they deserve to be paid.""

"DUBAI: Attackers seized a tanker linked to Israeloff the coast of Aden, Yemen, on Sunday, authorities said. While no group immediately claimed responsibility, it comes as at least two other maritime attacks in recent days have been linked to the Israel-Hamas war. The attackers seized the Liberian-flagged Central Park, managed by Zodiac Maritime, in the Gulf of Aden, the company and private intelligence firm Ambrey said.AUS defence official confirmed the attack took place.Zodiac called the attack “a suspected piracy incident”. “Our priority is the safety of our 22 crew onboard,” it said. “The Turkish-captained vessel has a multinational crew consisting of a crew of Russian, Vietnamese, Bulgarian, Indian, Georgian and Filipino nationals. The vessel is carrying a full cargo of phosphoric acid.” London-based Zodiac Maritime is part of Israeli billionaire Eyal Ofer’s Zodiac Group.It wasn’t immediately clear who was behind the attack. Aden is held by forces allied to Yemen’s internationally recognised government and a Saudiled coalition that has battled Yemen’s Iranian-backed Houthi rebels for years. That part of the Gulf of Aden in theory is under the control of those forces and is fairly distant from Houthi-controlled territory in the country. Somali pirates also are not known to operate in that area. The US defence official said the US and coalition forces are monitoring the situation.","Attackers seize Liberian-flagged Central Park, managed by Zodiac Maritime.

"Actor Cynthia Nixon joins activists and state legislators outside the White House in a protest against the US’s backing of the Gaza war. Washington, DC –State lawmakers and Palestinian rights supporters, joined by actor and progressive advocate Cynthia Nixon, have launched a five-day hunger strike outside the White House to demand aceasefire in Gaza. At a news conference on Monday, the activists decried United States President Joe Biden’s role in supporting the Israeli offensive in Gaza and called for an immediate end to the fighting. The hunger strike adds to thegrowing demandfor a ceasefire from activists, artists and politicians, as well as staff members working in theUS government. But Biden has so far resisted such calls, voicing unwavering support for Israel. Biden has also pledged more than $14bn in additional US aid to Israel — funds that advocates say are contributing to the Israeli violence. The protesters at Monday’s event stressed that public opinion polls show that most Americans back a ceasefire. They also underscored the scale of the destruction in Gaza, where more than 14,800 Palestinians have died. United Nations experts have warned that the conflict puts Palestinians “at grave risk of genocide“. “How many more Palestinians must be killed before you call for a ceasefire, President Biden? We cannot wait any longer,” said Iman Abid, an organiser with the US Campaign for Palestinian Rights (USCPR). Israel and Hamas declared a four-day truce in the conflict last week, and on Monday, officials announced the pause in fighting would continue for two additional days, to allow for the release of more Israeli captives and Palestinian prisoners. The hunger-strikers said that the continued pause demonstrates that diplomacy — not bombs — can solve the crisis in Gaza. Israeli leaders, however, have suggested that theywill resumethe bombing with more intensity once the truce expires. They have also warned residents from northern Gaza against returning to their homes. “The area north of the Gaza Strip is a combat zone, and it is forbidden to stay there,” Israeli military spokesperson Avichay Adraee said last week. This week’s hunger strike in Washington, DC, is organised by Palestine solidarity advocates, progressive Jewish groups as well as Arab and Palestinian-American organisations. Here’s what some of the hunger-strikers at the White House had to say: Today we begin a hunger strike in front of the White House demanding a permanent ceasefire.pic.twitter.com/BChpnSJX7z — Sumaya Awad (@sumayaawad)November 27, 2023  Best known for her work in the TV series Sex and the City and her run in the 2018 New York governor’s race, Nixon used her speech at Monday’s event to highlight the carnage in Gaza, including the killings of dozens of journalists and UN workers as well as the destruction ofentire neighbourhoods. “Our president’s seeming disregard for the incredible human toll Israel’sfar-right governmentis exacting on innocent civilians does not remotely reflect the desire of the overwhelming majority of Americans,” she said. “And I would like to make a personal plea to a president — who has himself experienced such devastatingpersonal loss— to connect with that empathy for which he is so well-known and to look at the children of Gaza and imagine that they were his children. “We implore him that this current ceasefire must continue, and we must build off it to begin to negotiate a more permanent peace. We cannot keep letting American tax dollars aid and abet the killing and starvation of millions of Palestinians. ‘Never again’ means never again — for anyone.” Wilson-Anton, a Muslim American legislator from Biden’s home state of Delaware, said that while she is anxious about abstaining from food for several days, her thoughts are with the people of Gaza who are experiencing a massacre with no choice or end in sight. “The majority ofAmericansare for a permanent ceasefire. And it’s unfortunate that our president and our congressional members are not being responsive to what’s important to Delawareans and Americans from all states,” Wilson-Anton, a Democrat, said. “And so I’m hoping that, this week, we’ll be successful in gaining the ear of our president and of our congressional members, so they can actually start to use their privilege and position to negotiate a ceasefire that is lasting.” Mamdani hailed the release of Israelis held by Hamas and Palestinians imprisoned by Israel during the truce. “We are hunger striking for a world where everyone is with their family. And it is a world that can only be made possible through a ceasefire. It is not war that brought us these reunifications. It is negotiations; it is a cessation [of hostilities],” he said. “We hunger-strike not because we want to. We hunger-strike because we have been forced by this president and by our government’s foreign policy. We hunger-strike because Palestinianshave been doubtedin life and death, and their experience has been erased.” Abdelhamid, a New York organiser, linked the killing of Palestinians in Gaza to a rise in prejudice against Arabs and Muslims in the US. She pointed to Saturday’s shooting of threePalestinian studentsin a suspected hate crime as an example. “As someone who has been organising against hate-based violence across this country, I’m fully aware that the violence and the anti-Palestinian rhetoric that we’re seeing abroad is also impacting us here in the United States. Those two things are inextricably linked,” Abdelhamid said. “When our elected [officials] and our politicians and our representatives are continuously dehumanising Palestinian people, are normalising Palestinian deaths, we get what we got two days ago. We get three Palestinian students in Vermont being shot for simplywearing a keffiyeh, for simply speaking Arabic.”      Awad stressed that the US is “complicit” in the ongoing violence against Palestinians. She added that the conflict also hasdomestic ramificationsin the US. “I’m Palestinian and I’m a New Yorker. I’m an American and I’m a mother of a 16-month-old, and I’m on hunger strike to illustrate to our government just a sliver, a fragment of what Palestinians are enduring in Gaza every single day,” Awad said. “I am on hunger strike to demand a permanent ceasefire and to say that we will continue to pressure our government in every way possible to get that permanent ceasefire because we are not just silent observers. We are complicit in what is happening in Palestine. “We are on hunger strike because what’s happening in Gaza is not something far away that we have nothing to do with.

"Wellington Koo says tax investigation is aimed at dissuading Foxconn founder Terry Gou from running for president. Taipei’s national security chief has said a Chinese tax probe into Taiwan tech giant Foxconn is “political” as its billionaire founder Terry Gou is running for president of the democratically ruled island. Gou, who gave up Foxconn’s management reins four years ago, launched his presidential bid in August as an independent candidate in Taiwan’s January polls. The Chinese state-run Global Timesreported last monththat Foxconn – one of the world’s largest contract producers of electronics and a key supplier for Apple’s iPhones – was under a “normal and legitimate” investigation for tax and land issues by mainland authorities. Chinese authorities have not confirmed the probe and Foxconn has said it will cooperate on “operations concerned” while urging “confidence” in the company. Taiwan’s National Security Council head said on Monday there was a “political aspect” to the Foxconn probe as election analysts have predicted that Gou’s entry into the race could split the opposition vote. “They [China] certainly don’t want Terry Gou to run,” Wellington Koo, whose department falls under President Tsai Ing-wen, told reporters. “Based on our observations, China does not want Terry Gou to split votes [within the pro-Beijing camp],” he said. When Gou entered the race, some critics alleged his relationship with Beijing was a cosy one given Foxconn’s numerous mainland factories, but he said he had “never been under the control of the [Chinese Communist Party]”. Taiwan is claimed by Beijing, which dislikes the Democratic Progressive Party’s government under Tsai as she has said the island does not belong to China. Koo added that Foxconn has also been looking to diversify its supply chain lines away from China, which could “also be a factor” in prompting an investigation from Chinese authorities. “If all assembly lines are moved out under the request of major US brands, the harm to China will be significant,” Koo said. His comments echoed others made by Taiwan’s top officials, including Deputy Premier Cheng Wen-tsan, who said Taiwanese businesses in China should not be subject to “political interference”. Foxconn is China’s largest private-sector employer, with more than a million workers nationwide. But the country’s strict COVID policies – as well as a bout of industrial unrest and ongoing diplomatic tensions with the United States – have hurt production. In May, it bought a huge tract of land on the outskirts of Indian tech hub Bengaluru and has since announced plans to expand its India operations. Analysts say Gou has a slim chance of winning, with DPP candidate Vice President Lai Ching-te currently in the lead.
