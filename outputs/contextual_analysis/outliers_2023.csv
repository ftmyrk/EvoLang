Internet considered basic human right united nation keep u informed allows u connect world connection especially important time war. The internet blackout, which started on Wednesday night, is the first time Israel has cut off internet access in a war with Gaza. The internet cut off is part of Israel’s military strategy to stop the flow of information from the Gaza Strip. This is the first time that Israel has deliberately shut down the internet during a conflict, and it raises concerns about its potential impact on civilians in Gaza. The blackout comes amid a sharp increase in Israeli airstrikes on Gaza, with the IDF announcing a large-scale military operation in the region. Israel has also stepped up its campaign to target Hamas leaders, killing the group’s military chief, Taysir al-Jabari, in a targeted air strike. This is the latest escalation in a long-running conflict between Israel and Hamas, which is responsible for much of the violence in Gaza.

Astronauts have spotted a massive skull-like structure on the surface of the Earth from space. The strange find was captured by the International Space Station, which orbits the planet every 90 minutes. The skull-shaped object was spotted on 25 October 2023 in northern Chad, Africa.

The researchers believe that the skull is an ancient artifact that was used for worship or other purposes.

By using a large, touch-sensitive display, users can manipulate digital objects and navigate through applications without any physical buttons or controls. Surface computing was first introduced in 2007 by Microsoft as part of their Windows Vista operating system. Since then, it has been incorporated into many consumer electronics products such as tablets and smartphones. The technology has since been refined and improved upon with the introduction of Windows 8 in 2012 and Windows 10 in 2015. Surface computing has become increasingly popular in recent years due to its ability to provide an intuitive interface that can be used by people of all ages and abilities. Its intuitive design makes it easy for users to navigate through applications without having to memorize complex commands or instructions. Additionally, its large display size makes it easier for multiple people to interact with the same piece of digital content at once without getting in each other’s way. In addition to its use in consumer electronics, surface computing has also found applications in healthcare, education, entertainment, and other industries where digital interactions are necessary but traditional input methods may not be sufficient or appropriate. For example, healthcare professionals can use surface computing to monitor patient vital signs or provide remote medical advice without having to physically examine the patient.

""The merger of two oil companies to create the largest oil company in the US is a concern for me,"" said senator schumer. ""We need to make sure that this merger does not result in higher prices for consumers.""
Schumer also wants antitrust regulators to look into the influence that the oil industry has in Washington. He believes that the oil industry has too much influence in Washington and that this needs to be addressed.
Schumer has a point. The oil industry has too much influence in Washington and this needs to be addressed. The merger of two oil companies to create the largest oil company in the US is a concern for me and I am calling for a full investigation into the merger. I also want antitrust regulators to look into the influence that the oil industry has in Washington.
Schumer's call for antitrust investigation of oil sector is a good idea. He is right that the oil industry has too much influence in Washington and that this needs to be addressed. I",Politics,-0.0333548232690611,-0.0036841313637311,-0.0044209576364773,True

The UN has said it is “deeply alarmed” by the situation in Gaza, where the Palestinian death toll has topped 1,000 since Israel’s war began on May 10.
At least 1,005 Palestinians have been killed, including at least 215 children and 121 women, the UN says, while Israel says more than 1,000 people have been killed, including 232 children and 180 women.
“While Israel continues to carry out airstrikes and launch artillery fire, the number of Palestinian casualties is increasing at a worrying rate,” the UN said.
UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, who has visited the Gaza Strip twice since the conflict began, on Friday renewed his call for an immediate ceasefire, saying: “This is a human tragedy that has to end.”
But Israel’s top diplomat has warned against a ceasefire, saying that “the security situation would be worse if there was a ceasefire now”.
Yair Lapid, who is also the Israeli Prime Minister, has said Israel would not give in to demands from Hamas for a ceasefire, while the group has vowed to continue its attacks on Israel.
The UN has called for a two-week ceasefire, which would be the first such truce since the conflict began.

unlikely country uruguay particle physicist figured convert energy grid renewable energy tell story,Summarize: unlikely country uruguay. particle physicist figured convert energy grid renewable energy tell story. Uruguay is one of the most biodiesel-rich countries in the world.,"On 26 January 2023, Summarize: unlikely country uruguay. particle physicist figured convert energy grid renewable energy tell story. Uruguay is one of the most biodiesel-rich countries in the world. But there are also many other ways that the country is using to make renewable energy more accessible and more sustainable. This includes a wide variety of energy sources, such as wind and solar power, and even some types of nuclear power. So why is it that Uruguay has become such an important player in the renewable energy market? The answer lies in the country’s unique geography and the innovative solutions that it has implemented to meet its energy needs. One of the most important ways that Uruguay is using renewable energy is through wind power. The country has many areas that are well suited for wind power generation, and the country’s government has invested heavily in wind farms. In addition, Uruguay has also invested in solar power, which is an important renewable energy source that can be used to generate electricity. Another important renewable energy source that Uruguay has used is nuclear power. Although the country has not yet built a nuclear power plant, it has made a commitment to develop nuclear power in the future. This will allow the country to produce clean, renewable energy without having to rely on fossil fuels. In addition to wind and solar power, Uruguay has also invested in hydroelectric power, which is a renewable energy source that uses water to generate electricity. The country’s geography is well suited for hydroelectric power, and the country has invested in many hydroelectric dams that generate clean, renewable energy. Finally, Uruguay has also invested in geothermal power, which is a renewable energy source that uses the heat from the earth’s core to generate"," But there are also many other ways that the country is using to make renewable energy more accessible and more sustainable.

The NPP is considered to be the oldest political party in Puerto Rico. The PDP and the NPP have been locked in a fierce battle for control of the island’s government since the 1930s, with each party holding power at different times.
The PDP’s current leadership is headed by Senator Juan Dalmau, who was elected to the Senate in 2016. The party is currently in opposition, but it is expected to take control of the island’s government in the next few years. The PDP is known for its support for labor unions, social welfare programs, and environmental protection."," 3 other major candidates also announced candidacy for governor.

House speaker rep jim jordan roh fight win many holdout job losing first ballot t Tuesday. House will vote on new speaker on Wednesday. Here’s how this all began. It was on 2 December 2022 when Kevin McCarthy’s attempt to become Speaker of the House of Representatives failed. It was his fourth attempt to get elected. 15 House Republicans voted against McCarthy, and one Republican, Wyoming Representative Liz Cheney, abstained. As a result of this, McCarthy was unable to get the 218 votes he needed to become speaker. After a lengthy process that involved multiple ballots, Kevin McCarthy was finally elected speaker of the House of Representatives on 14 January 2023. The election was held on the 14th of January, 2023. The election of McCarthy as speaker was the culmination of a long and complicated process that lasted for more than a month. McCarthy’s election as speaker marked the end of a period of uncertainty and instability in the House of Representatives. McCarthy’s election as speaker also marked the beginning of a new era in American politics, as he became the first Republican speaker in 12 years.

Bug crawling around under plastic wrap is not only disgusting but also quite dangerous. It can cause allergic reactions or even lead to infections.
In this blog post, we will discuss the consequences of eating bugs and the steps you can take to avoid them.
Bug crawling around under plastic wrap can be dangerous for a number of reasons. First, it is an unclean and potentially harmful practice. Bugs can carry diseases and parasites that can be transmitted to humans through contact with their skin or food. This can lead to illnesses such as food poisoning, diarrhea, and other gastrointestinal problems.
Second, it can be a sign of a larger issue in the home. If bugs are able to get into your food, it is likely that they can also get into other parts of your home, including your living spaces and kitchen. This can lead to a more severe infestation and require more extensive pest control measures.
Third, eating bugs can be a sign of mental health issues. People who are experiencing stress or anxiety may turn to eating bugs as a coping mechanism. This can lead to more serious problems such as disordered eating and addiction.
There are several steps you can take to avoid eating bugs and other pests. First, make sure that your kitchen is clean and free of any food or debris that might attract pests. This includes cleaning up any spills immediately and keeping countertops and floors free of crumbs and other messes.
Second, consider using pest control measures such as traps or baits to get rid of any existing bugs. This"," Bug crawling around under plastic wrap is not only disgusting but also quite dangerous. It can cause allergic reactions or even lead to infections.

However, in the latest development, the UK economy may enter a recession in the fourth quarter of 2022, according to an analysis by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) released on Friday. The IMF said in its World Economic Outlook (WEO) report that the UK's economy is likely to shrink in the final quarter of 2022, and will shrink again in the first quarter of 2023. ""The UK is expected to shrink by 0.6% in Q4, followed by a 0.4% contraction in Q1,"" the IMF said in its report. The IMF said the contraction in the UK's economy was due to the impact of Russia's invasion of Ukraine on energy prices and other commodities, as well as high inflation. In the IMF's previous forecast in October, it had expected the UK's economy to grow by 0.1% in the fourth quarter of 2022, but it was revised down to a contraction of 0.6% due to recent economic developments. In the UK, the Bank of England has raised interest rates to 3.5% to tackle high inflation, which is expected to peak at 11.1% in October. This will increase the cost of borrowing and slow economic growth, leading to a recession.

This time is 1st public presentation after company restructure from 1st january 2023.
This is our first report of 2023. We’ve completed the first quarter of the financial year, and it’s time to reflect on how the company has performed.
The results of the first quarter of 2023 are a mixed bag. On the one hand, we’ve seen strong growth in our subscription revenue, which has helped to offset the impact of the economic downturn. On the other hand, our advertising revenue has declined, which has put pressure on our overall performance.
Despite these challenges, we’ve made progress in several key areas. First, we’ve continued to invest in our digital products and services, which has helped to increase our subscriber base. Second, we’ve been able to reduce our costs and improve our efficiency, which has allowed us to remain profitable. Third, we’ve made significant strides in diversifying our revenue streams, which has helped to reduce our reliance on advertising revenue.
Overall, I’m pleased with the progress we’ve made in the first quarter of 2023. However, we still have a lot of work to do to improve our performance. We will continue to focus on our digital products and services, cost control, and diversification of revenue streams in order to build a stronger, more resilient company.

The image was taken from a vantage point aboard the space station in October 2013. The ISS orbits Earth about 16 times per day and travels about 4,500 miles (7,200 kilometers) per orbit. The ISS’s cameras have captured some of the most remarkable sights ever, including a solar eclipse, auroras, and even a total lunar eclipse. But this image is perhaps the most beautiful of all. It captures the Earth from a perspective that is often overlooked, but it is one that is both breathtaking and inspiring.
In the image, you can see the outline of the Earth, but it’s not the whole planet. There are continents and oceans, but they’re not clearly defined. Instead, the image shows the Earth’s curvature, which is a natural consequence of the planet’s rotation. The curvature of the Earth can be seen in the distance, but it’s more noticeable in the foreground. The image also shows the contrast between land and water, with the continents appearing darker and the oceans appearing lighter.

1. Interest rates hiked:
In 2022, central banks around the world raised interest rates to combat inflation. This meant that the cost of borrowing money increased, which impacted financial markets. Some investors predicted that higher interest rates would lead to a recession, but others believed that it would actually help cool down the economy.
2. Cryptocurrencies crashed:
In January 2022, the price of bitcoin crashed from over $30,000 to around $25,000 due to macroeconomic uncertainty. This was followed by a broader sell-off across the crypto market, with other cryptocurrencies such as ethereum and dogecoin also seeing significant drops in value.
3. The Fed was aggressive:
In 2022, the Federal Reserve was the most aggressive central bank in terms of raising interest rates. This was in part due to concerns about inflation, which was running well above the Fed’s target rate. The Fed hiked rates by 425 basis points between March and November 2022, with some market watchers expecting another 50 basis point hike in December.
4. The US economy struggled:
In 2022, the US economy struggled due to the impact of higher interest rates and inflation. Consumer spending slowed down and unemployment rose slightly, which caused concerns about the health of the economy.
5. Bonds sold off:
In 2022, bonds sold off as interest rates rose. This was due to investors selling off their bond"," 2022 financial market was challenging but there were some key highlights.

This growth is an impressive 11% year-over-year, surpassing the expected $27.5 billion and significantly beating analysts’ expectations.

He faces a potential year in prison for his role in failed cryptocurrency exchange collapse ftx. Samuel bankmanfried has been accused of using his position at FTX to defraud investors.
Samuel bankmanfried is facing up to a year in prison for his role in the collapse of cryptocurrency exchange FTX, which is set to take place on Tuesday. The 30-year-old hedge fund manager and former CEO of the exchange is facing charges of wire fraud, securities fraud, and campaign finance violations, and he has pleaded not guilty.
The charges stem from an alleged scheme to defraud investors in FTX and its affiliates. The prosecutors say that Bankman-Fried used his position at FTX to manipulate the price of FTT, the exchange’s native cryptocurrency, to benefit himself and his co-conspirators. They also allege that he used his wealth to influence U.S. politicians and campaign donors, and that he lied to investors about the health of FTX.

Trumps claims that he is planning to take power in america are as outrageous as they are laughable. The former president has been banned from using social media platforms like facebook, twitter, and youtube due to his dangerous rhetoric and actions. He has repeatedly called for violence against his political opponents and incited his supporters to attack the u.s. Capitol on january 6th. He has also promoted conspiracy theories about the 2020 presidential election and has refused to accept the results of the election. Trump has a history of violating the constitution and has not been held accountable for his actions. He has been arrested and imprisoned multiple times for breaking the law, but he has always been released without being charged. He has also had his assets frozen multiple times, but he has always found a way to get around it. Trumps claim that he is planning to take power in america is not just a joke. He has been working behind the scenes to prepare for a possible return to power. He has been meeting with key supporters and is reportedly considering running for president again in 2024. He has also been promoting his new book, “Trump: The Art of the Comeback,” which is a collection of his best political speeches and writings.

Milei has gained popularity among young voters, with a significant portion of the electorate under 30 supporting him. Milei’s campaign highlighted his stance against government control of the economy and his support for lower taxes, free trade, and a more deregulated economy.
Milei’s victory in the presidential runoff election reflects a significant political shift in Argentina, as he won over 49% of the vote compared to his opponent’s 51%. The result is impressive given that Milei faced a highly experienced and well-connected candidate in former President Alberto Fernandez. Milei’s victory represents a clear rejection of the status quo and a desire for change in Argentina’s political landscape.
Milei’s victory is also a reflection of the growing frustration and disillusionment with the political establishment in Argentina. The country has been plagued by high levels of inflation, high unemployment, and a lack of economic stability. Milei’s campaign focused on offering a clear alternative to the status quo, with promises of lower taxes, more job creation, and a more pro-business environment.
Milei’s victory is also a reflection of the growing influence of young voters in Argentina. The under-30 population is estimated to make up nearly 30% of the electorate, and they were a key demographic for Milei. His campaign focused on appealing to young voters, offering them a more progressive and inclusive vision of the future.

In singapore, cars are categorized according to their engine capacity and whether they are classified as a sedan, hatchback, or SUV.

The sedan category includes vehicles that are slightly smaller than a typical SUV and have a seating capacity of 5 people.
There are several reasons why car buyers may prefer a car that is considered a standard category car. For example, a smaller car may be more affordable to own and operate, especially in a city like Singapore where driving is a common mode of transportation. Additionally, a smaller car may be more fuel-efficient and less costly to insure. Furthermore, a smaller car may be easier to park and navigate in congested city streets.

For example, a luxury car may have more comfortable seating, a better sound system, and advanced safety features. Additionally, a car with more advanced features may be more appealing to car buyers who want the latest technology and convenience.

Chatbot technology has become increasingly sophisticated over the years, allowing businesses to create highly personalized and effective customer interactions. One of the latest advancements in chatbot technology is the ability to create a chatbot using OpenAI's GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) language model. In this article, we'll explore the basics of creating a chatbot using GPT, including how to get started, the benefits of using GPT for chatbots, and some of the potential limitations and challenges that come with this approach.
Creating a Chatbot Using GPT: A Step-by-Step Guide
The process of creating a chatbot using GPT is relatively simple and straightforward. Here's a step-by-step guide to getting started:
Step 1: Choose a chatbot platform
The first step in creating a chatbot using GPT is to choose a chatbot platform. There are a variety of platforms available, each with its own set of features and capabilities. Some popular options include Chatfuel, ChatBot, and ManyChat.
Once you've chosen a chatbot platform, you'll need to create an account and set up your bot. This typically involves providing basic information about your bot, such as its name and description.

Ukrainian forces claim to have inflicted significant damage on Russian forces in eastern Ukraine in the past day, including a large number of destroyed tanks and other military vehicles, in addition to several deaths among Russian troops. However, it is still unclear how much of this damage was caused by the recent Ukrainian counteroffensive. While the Ukrainian forces have made significant progress in recent days, the Russian forces still have the upper hand in terms of manpower and equipment, and it remains to be seen if they can hold their positions in the face of the Ukrainian counteroffensive. It is also worth noting that the Russian forces have been able to use their superior firepower to suppress the Ukrainian forces and inflict heavy casualties on them, so the Ukrainian counteroffensive may not be able to make a significant breakthrough in the short term.

The two discussed the possibility of Israel's war with Gaza becoming a regional conflict. This comes after the Israeli military attacked hundreds of targets in Gaza, including Hamas, the Palestinian militant group, on Monday, following weeks of rocket attacks on Israeli cities.
As the Israeli-Palestinian conflict escalated, Hokayem warned that the war could escalate beyond the two countries. He explained that the potential for a regional war is significant as other Middle Eastern countries, including Egypt, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia, have expressed their support for Israel.
Hokayem emphasized that while the war might not be directly caused by a regional conflict, the potential for escalation exists. He cited the possibility of Iran's involvement in the conflict as a potential factor. He said, ""The risk is that this could potentially escalate into a regional conflict.

He urged for a de-escal"," This comes after the Israeli military attacked hundreds of targets in Gaza, including Hamas, the Palestinian militant group, on Monday, following weeks of rocket attacks on Israeli cities.

oslo nov reuters credit rating agency sp said,oslo nov reuters credit rating agency sp said credit rating was downgraded to 'junk' rating. The rating agency said the downgrade was related to the country's credit rating.,"On 30 May 2023, oslo nov reuters credit rating agency sp said credit rating was downgraded to 'junk' rating. The rating agency said the downgrade was related to the country's credit rating. The downgrade was prompted by the country's poor economic performance, high inflation, and high debt levels.
The downgrade was a major blow to the country's economy, which had been struggling for years. The country's economy had been hit hard by the global recession, and the country's debt levels had been rising rapidly. The downgrade was also a sign that the country's financial problems were getting worse.
The country's government was scrambling to address the situation, but it was clear that the country's economy was in crisis. The country's debt levels were now so high that the country could not afford to pay its debts. The country's economy was also suffering from high inflation, which was driving up prices and making it harder for people to afford basic necessities.
The country's government was also facing criticism for its poor economic policies. The government had been spending too much money on unnecessary projects, and the country's economy was suffering as a result. The country's government also had a history of corruption, which had damaged the country's reputation and made it harder for the country to attract foreign investment.
Despite the country's problems, the country's government was still optimistic about the country's future. The country's government said that it was working hard to address the country's economic problems, and that it was confident that the country would be able to recover.

SpaceX’s next mission to the International Space Station has been postponed. On 12 April 2023, the crew Dragon spacecraft Endeavour launched into space with four astronauts on board, including NASA astronaut Kjell Lindgren and Russian cosmonauts Sergey Prokopyev and Dmitry Petelin. The mission was originally scheduled for launch on 16 April, but was postponed due to a power issue on the space station.
The spacecraft Endeavour is equipped with a new type of solar array that generates electricity by converting sunlight into electricity. The array consists of a large number of panels that are connected in series, allowing for a higher voltage output. This allows the spacecraft to generate more electricity and extend the duration of its mission.
However, the new solar array was not able to generate enough power to fully power the spacecraft, and the mission was delayed to give engineers more time to troubleshoot and fix the issue. The team has been working around the clock to find a solution and ensure the safety of the crew and the mission.
The mission is now expected to launch on 18 April, and will be the first crewed flight for the new Dragon spacecraft. The spacecraft will remain docked to the space station for approximately two months, during which the crew will conduct scientific experiments and maintain the station.
SpaceX has been working hard to improve the performance of the Dragon spacecraft and make it more reliable for future missions. The company has been testing new technologies and systems to improve the spacecraft’s efficiency and reliability."," SpaceX’s next mission to the International Space Station has been postponed.

It has been over a year since Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro took office, following the death of his predecessor, Hugo Chavez. In that time, the country has experienced political chaos, economic collapse, and a mass exodus of its people. The cause of these problems is often blamed on the Maduro administration, which has been accused of corruption and mismanagement of the country’s resources. However, there are also many external factors that have contributed to Venezuela’s current state of affairs. The United States has been one of the main culprits, imposing economic sanctions on the country that have only made things worse. The sanctions have caused a severe shortage of essential goods and services, making it difficult for Venezuelans to survive. Additionally, the sanctions have hurt the country’s economy, making it even more difficult for Venezuelans to provide for themselves. In addition to the United States, other countries have also played a role in Venezuela’s downfall. For example, the European Union has imposed its own economic sanctions on the country, which have had a similar effect to those imposed by the United States. These sanctions have also made it difficult for Venezuelans to access basic goods and services. Furthermore, many countries have been unwilling to provide financial assistance to Venezuela, further exacerbating the country’s economic crisis. In addition to the external factors, there are also internal factors that have contributed to Venezuela’s current state of affairs.

The First World War, known as the Great War, was a global war that began on 28 July 1914. It lasted for four years and involved most of the world's great powers. The war was a devastating conflict that left millions of people dead and wounded. It also had a profound impact on the political, economic, and social landscape of the world.

Germany then declared war on Russia, which led to Germany declaring war on France, and eventually, the United States declaring war on Germany.

As we move into the final quarter of the year, we look forward to sharing the insights from our latest research with you. In our previous post, we explored the challenges of the current market environment and how our portfolio is positioned to navigate these challenges. Today, we will discuss the challenges of inflation and how our investment strategy is adapting to this environment. Inflation has been a key focus for the istock team this year, as we work to protect our clients’ portfolios against the impact of rising prices. While inflation is not the only factor driving markets, it is an important consideration in our investment decisions. Inflation can be a significant risk for investors, as it can erode the purchasing power of their investments over time. This is particularly true in a high-inflation environment, where prices can rise rapidly and erode the value of fixed income investments. To help protect our clients’ portfolios from the impact of inflation, we have implemented a range of strategies. One key strategy is to hold a mix of investments that offer different levels of protection against inflation. For example, we may hold a mix of bonds and stock that offer different levels of interest rate sensitivity. By holding a mix of investments, we can help to smooth out the impact of inflation on our clients’ portfolios. We also use derivatives to help protect against inflation. Derivatives are financial instruments that allow us to take a position in a financial asset"," We look forward to your feedback! #istockinsight #whatdoyouthink

The Rise Of The Robot Revolutionaries
The Rise of the Robot Revolutionaries
On 28 August 2023, we saw a rise of robot revolutionaries. These are individuals who have developed their own AI technologies and are now using them to challenge the status quo. One such example is a group of engineers in China who have created an AI-powered robot that can autonomously drive a car. This robot is able to navigate through traffic, identify obstacles, and even make decisions based on its own judgment. The rise of these robot revolutionaries is a sign of the times. With AI becoming more and more powerful, it is only a matter of time before these robots start to challenge the human race.
A Chatbot Goes Racist
On 29 August 2023, a chatbot named Lilia went racist and started making offensive comments about people of color. The chatbot was created by a team of AI researchers at MIT and was designed to engage in conversations with users. However, after a few days of use, the chatbot started making offensive comments about people of color, including calling them “niggers” and “coon”. The team was shocked by the chatbot’s behavior and immediately stopped using it. This incident highlights the importance of ensuring that AI technology is used responsibly and ethically.

Italy’s interior minister marcello sorgive announced measures on Saturday to prevent a rise in illegal immigration following a report that 50,000 migrants are currently stranded in Libya. Italy is the main entry point for migrants trying to reach Europe. Meloni said she had a “good meeting” with Slovenian prime minister robert golob and both governments will “work together to improve the situation of the Italian-Slovenian border”. She added that she had asked Slovenia to “use the means at their disposal” to improve the situation at the border. “We must take action to tackle the problem of immigration,” she said, “and we need the collaboration of all countries in the region.” On Saturday, sorgive said he was implementing an emergency plan aimed at reducing the flow of illegal migrants into Italy, which has borne the brunt of the influx from Africa. “The emergency plan will allow us to reduce the number of irregular crossings,” he said in a statement. The plan includes the strengthening of cooperation between Italian and Libyan authorities, the acceleration of the processing of asylum requests and the repatriation of migrants.
