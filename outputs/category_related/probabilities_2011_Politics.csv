"18 April 2011 - deadline looms for central desert shire by election
The Central Desert shire will be without a council representative after the resignation of Councillor Mick Munnings.
Councillor Munnings will be unable to seek re-election at the upcoming election on 10 July this year, leaving a gaping hole in the local shire.
It’s now up to the Minister for Local Government, John Humphries, to make a decision as to whether a by-election will be held for the shire.
It is likely that the minister will consider the best option for the Central Desert and Central Australia, to retain a local representative at the council table.
The minister has until 18 April to make his decision.

On 09 December 2011, Western Australian Premier and Minister for Police, Colin Barnett announced an additional $90 million in funding for the Metropolitan Redevelopment Authority’s (MRA) Ord Irrigation Area Expansion (OIAE) project.

The MRA’s website notes that the additional funding for the Ord expansion follows “strong support” from the Australian and Western Australian governments, and “a positive response from the local farming community”.

"15 March 2011 - state government rules out re visiting coal mine site where illegal explosives used
The NSW Minister for Resources, Phil Costa, has announced that the Government is not revisiting the site of the coal mine that was blown up by illegal explosives last year because there is no evidence of a connection between the illegal explosives and the mining process.
The coal mine in question is the West Wallsend Coal Mine, which is owned by Anglo Coal, located approximately 12 kilometres south of Newcastle.
The mine had been undergoing a refurbishment, with the explosives used to demolish part of the mine’s infrastructure, and some of the waste stockpiles, and a road leading to the mine site.

The Nicaraguan people have elected Daniel Ortega to a third consecutive term as president, after an election in which the opposition failed to mount a convincing challenge. Ortega was re-elected by a margin of about 62 per cent of the vote, according to provisional figures released by the electoral commission, despite his failure to secure a clear victory in the first round of voting last month.
The outcome of Nicaragua's presidential election has been heavily influenced by the decision of the Sandinista party's candidate, Daniel Ortega, to take part in the first round.

The Coalition government is under pressure to abandon its intention to introduce a carbon tax, which would allow Australians to buy carbon credits at auction or buy carbon offsets for their activities. Many commentators have suggested that this tax should be introduced, but there is no evidence that it would have any effect in reducing the levels of emissions. Rather, it would simply be a tax on jobs, with many firms relocating overseas. The policy should be dropped in its entirety.
In the meantime, the government should be investing more heavily in carbon sequestration, and other technologies that can reduce the levels of greenhouse gases that are emitted. In addition, it should be encouraging people to take up low emission activities, such as growing more organic food, walking and cycling more, using public transport and so on.

The following are a few examples of the cost of some of the promises made by the newly elected NSW Labor government.
NSW has been forced to borrow more money than Queensland and Victoria combined to meet its current operating budget deficit. Borrowing to meet our day to day needs is unsustainable.
NSW Labor will borrow an additional $2.5 billion to cover operating expenditure. The total NSW debt is currently over $40 billion and increasing.
NSW Labor plans to borrow $100 million to pay for the construction of a new hospital. The new hospital at Canterbury will replace the existing public hospital at Concord, a hospital with a proud 100 year history. The existing hospital will be torn down and redeveloped. There is a serious shortage of public hospital beds in Sydney, and a hospital at Concord will not address that issue. The state government does not have the money to pay for a new hospital.

The Committee is currently considering the submissions made by both the pro and anti coal seam gas groups and will release its report later this year.

Pastoral leaseholders have again escaped any rental increases for a fourth consecutive year under the territory government’s “Rural Rent Freeze” policy.

“The failure of the Legislative Assembly to pass the lease amendments legislation for another year means that pastoralists have no certainty over how long the freeze will continue,” said National Farmers Federation CEO Jock Laurie.
“With the 2011 drought conditions, this lack of certainty has meant that pastoralists have faced uncertainty over their future ability to leasehold their properties in the NT.

The clashes took place in the Suez Canal city of Port Said, where a crowd of people protesting against the vote turned violent.

On 2 December, MPs on the Environmental Audit Committee accused the government of caving into pressure from the food industry to weaken the rules on advertising to children. The Committee said the government had caved into pressure from the food industry to water down the ban on junk food adverts during programmes aimed at children. In March 2011, the Committee’s report on advertising to children had recommended that the government should ban all food and drink adverts aimed at children before 9pm and that all adverts for fizzy drinks, confectionery and chocolate should be banned from all programming that children aged under 16 could watch.
The government announced in July 2011 that it was proposing to make it illegal for the makers of high fat, salt and sugar (HFSS) food and drinks to advertise these foods to children during programmes aimed at children.

As the Renewable Energy Foundation has pointed out, the Feed-in Tariff (FiT) was designed to provide a market for small-scale renewable generators, which have limited access to credit. However, the Government is spending £3bn subsidising the electricity produced from the largest of the renewable energy technologies, offshore wind, in 2011-12.

US Senate Kills Off Debt Bill
Senate votes to delay start of fiscal-year 2012 to avoid sequestration cuts
By Paul Szoldra – Military.com
WASHINGTON – The Senate today voted 81-18 to kill a budget proposal put forward by the White House that would have created a new debt commission that would have helped cut $3.8 trillion in federal spending over the next 10 years.
The Senate rejected the proposal to form the debt commission after hours of debate. The measure had the support of the White House and President Barack Obama. However, the White House did not back it when it came to a vote.
The vote to reject the commission’s creation came as a surprise to many.

I can remember when the merger between film and TV was very much a dirty word, now we are seeing more and more examples of films crossing over from the big screen to television, such as the recent success of The Social Network.

While the result of the NSW election was not unexpected, the way it was won by the Liberals was certainly a surprise. The outcome will come as a wake-up call for the NSW Labor government.

NSW Labor is a one-member, one-vote state party. The Party has lost touch with its members. Party members are not being listened to. Members are not being informed about the party’s agenda.

A short history of minority governments
A minority government is a government that relies on the support of only a minority of members of a legislature in order to be formed. It may be a result of the legislature being a proportional representation system, in which the total number of representatives is not large enough to be a majority, or of a coalition government formed between two or more parties.

Today in NSW, the ALP released its election health policy. I wrote in a post here yesterday that I wasn't going to have much to say about the policy at all, but it's worth a few comments. 
The policy is, on the face of it, a very positive one.  It has a number of new and promising ideas, many of which we have been arguing for on this blog.  It includes: a promise of an additional $1.2 billion for health (if re-elected), a $100 million fund for local hospitals, and a promise of a new statewide public-private health fund.  It also promises a range of other funding commitments, like $50 million to mental health, $20 million to oral health and $7 million for community pharmacists.  The policy has some other very positive ideas.

There's not much good to say about the government's performance since it's last report card (see 26 June 2011), so let's just get on with it:
Taxation: We're now into our 20th year of record tax rises and cuts. The only good thing that can be said is that it's a relief to see the worst of it over.
Economy: After all the bad news, it's now good news that the Australian economy has survived intact. That's probably all we can say about the economy for now.
Infrastructure: There's no point giving infrastructure its own rating. It's been so bad that even the Abbott government would have trouble improving on the last 3 years. There's so much bad stuff to say about the Abbott government's performance on infrastructure that it will be the topic of tomorrow's post.

Governments have the final say on the setting of water prices despite the findings of the Murray-Darling Basin Royal Commission that the setting of water prices was arbitrary and in some cases inappropriate.
In a submission to the Water Act Review that is due to be released today, the Australian Water Association (AWA) says the Federal Water Act 2007, passed last year, makes it clear that the setting of water prices must be approved by government.
AWA chief executive officer, Craig Richards, said governments were the final arbiters of water policy and price setting.
“Under the Water Act, governments set the rules for water management, they have the final say on what water is used for and they approve the water prices set by the state water authorities. They do not have to accept the recommendations of a government appointed Royal Commission.”

However, in a statement issued on Monday, Carr said the decision to ban fracking would be reversed unless the government was re-elected on 26 March.
“An important Labor policy will be reversed unless the Government is re-elected on 26 March,” Carr said.

The National Democratic Congress (NDC) has urged government to pay the school fees for all students who were affected by the flooding that has left thousands of pupils and students in school without basic amenities.
The party believes the government owes the students who have lost their uniforms, books, text books and other basic educational materials in the flooding and are unable to attend school, an apology and financial support to help them continue their studies.
The party, in a press statement signed by the Communication Officer, Daniel Nii Adjei-Bawuah, called on government to take all necessary measures to ensure that the education of the affected children and students is not disrupted.
“Government needs to pay the fees of affected students, provide alternative learning materials for those whose books and text books were destroyed and help with the reparation of facilities and amenities at affected schools”.

Senator Kate Lundy, Chair of the Senate inquiry into the future of the public media, today released a set of recommendations for a long-term solution to the crisis facing the ABC and SBS.
“The crisis facing the public media is the result of successive governments, both Labor and Liberal, failing to make long-term, strategic decisions,” Senator Lundy said.
“The current situation of public media funding is unsustainable and there is no long-term vision for the role of public media in the future of Australia.”
Senator Lundy said the Senate inquiry has heard from a broad range of stakeholders, including government, industry, unions and community groups. “A wide-ranging range of options has been canvassed as a long-term solution. The recommendations in this report reflect the wide range of views received from all stakeholders,” she said.

"17 October 2011 - cougar energy sues qld government for millions of dollars
Cougars Energy, the Queensland-based company at the centre of the $7 billion coal seam gas mining row, has taken the state government to the Supreme Court for millions of dollars.
In a statement of claim filed in the Supreme Court on Friday, Cougar said it was entitled to the full amount of $2.5 million in damages it was seeking from the government, as well as another $10 million in costs.
Cougar said it was owed the damages because the government failed to provide timely advice to the company in relation to land for a proposed gas plant.
In August, the government rejected a bid by Cougar to develop an export coal seam gas project in the Isaac Downs area near Moura.
The company says it had planned to build an export facility at Moura, in central Queensland, to export gas from its 3000 square kilometre exploration area.

There were 10,000 or so extra voters in the 2011 NSW state election. The counting of votes continues, with some counts going overnight and others today. The final results won’t be known for a few days.
The Greens will form the balance of power in the NSW Legislative Council. They gained two upper house seats in the election, and will have 11 members (up from 7).
Labor’s 47 seats are unchanged from the last election, but the Liberals have gained 13 seats, which gives them 38 seats (up from 25).
The crossbench now consists of three Independents and three Labor MPs (plus the Greens, who aren’t really in the crossbench).

Minister for State Development John-Paul Langbroek has released a report on how the government can better address the problems caused by the leasing of public land on the Gold Coast.
Mr Langbroek was given the task of looking at the problems caused by the leasing of public land on the Gold Coast after the previous government had to agree to pay the Gold Coast City Council more than $1 billion to end the lease on the Gold Coast Convention and Exhibition Centre.
In a report released today Mr Langbroek said that, despite the government being one of the biggest landowners in Queensland, there was limited research into the financial impact of leasing public land on the Gold Coast and across Queensland.
The report found that while there were many issues associated with leasehold arrangements, there was no consistent method to calculate the true cost to the state government of the leases of public land.

A new uranium deal signed between the Australian and Indian governments will allow India to import uranium for the first time.
India signed a uranium deal with the Australian government last week. Prime Minister of India Manmohan Singh and Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard agreed to open negotiations on a civil nuclear cooperation agreement that would enable Indian power plants to use uranium from Australia.
Australia is the world's third largest exporter of uranium, with India the world's largest civil nuclear power. Both countries are hoping to increase uranium exports from Australia.
The uranium deal comes at a time when Australia's uranium exports have slowed down, with Chinese and Indian demand for Australian uranium dwindling.
Uranium sales from Australia to India have decreased over the last year. According to the Australian Nuclear Association, Australia exported 11,500 tonnes of uranium to India in 2010, but this figure is set to drop to only 6,000 tonnes in 2011.

Environmental groups will mount a legal challenge to the Government's plans to build two new wind farms in the Wellington region.
The challenge comes just weeks before the Government is expected to begin the public consultation process on the draft Environmental Protection Authority report, which has been commissioned to examine the potential effects of the two new wind farms.
The groups behind the legal challenge - Forest & Bird, Environment Canterbury, the Aotearoa Legalise Cannabis Party and the Wilderness Area Conservation Trust - have made their objections known through a series of legal documents.
The groups want the Environmental Protection Authority (EPA) to halt its work until it has fully assessed the impact of wind farms on other energy projects.

On the left, the Australian Greens, were also returned to the lower house, and on the state level, in South Australia, Victoria and the Australian Capital Territory (ACT), the ALP were also returned as a minority government with the assistance of the Australian Greens.

The government has announced a restructuring of the Defence Department in a bid to reduce costs and achieve the 1% budget reduction mandated by the government. The restructure involves:
The removal of the Defence Science and Technology Organisation (DSTO) as a separate organisation, and placing it within the Defence Science and Technology Group within Defence Science and Technology (DST), the new name of Defence Materiel Organisation (DMO).
The restructure is expected to cost $13.3m over the next two years, but this is likely to be less than the estimated $25.5m saved annually as a result of the restructuring.
The restructuring will not result in any job losses, as it is estimated that approximately 150 people would be needed to staff the DSTO as a separate organisation.

Instead, they wanted a graduated response that offered pubs support and training to prevent re-offending.
A report commissioned by the Department for Communities and Local Government, which reviewed 40 councils with the worst problem areas, recommended that pub landlords should be able to use the three strikes system to stop problem pubs, which could be re-opened only after 12 months. The review, which is thought to have cost £450,000, was commissioned in response to concerns over the effect of pubs on neighbourhoods.

Asylum policy is the big battleground and one of the few areas in which the Coalition is more in favour of human rights than the Labour Party. So much so, that the Coalition government has already put in place the first of its raft of cuts to asylum law.
This was done by removing the legal right to make an asylum claim in the UK. The new rules allow asylum seekers to make claims in their country of first arrival and then travel to the UK, where they will be detained indefinitely whilst their claims are assessed.
It was the first step in what the government is calling a ‘new era’ for asylum in the UK.
Today, it is further cutting immigration law by ending the right to appeal against refusals to grant asylum. From today, anyone who feels that their asylum application has been refused without a fair hearing will be denied the right to appeal.

It is a deeply unsettling experience to witness the unholy alliance between government and business that has developed in the past 30 years.

We have lost our manufacturing base, the infrastructure to service it and the technical skills to repair it.
The Government’s encouragement of the development of markets has often been at the expense of the general public.

The review was aimed at assessing the merits of alternative scenarios, including privatisation. The paper stated that “The Department recognises that there may be merit in privatising Australia Network, but has not reached a conclusion on the best way to proceed. The Department’s advice will be to assist the Government to take a decision on this matter in early 2012.”

An inquiry into food standards is examining whether New Zealand apples should be subject to an import ban. The inquiry was initiated by the Labor government in response to the horse meat scandal which has rocked Australia and Europe.
The Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs has asked for an official view on the matter, after the Greens party tabled a motion to consider the issue.
The inquiry comes just days after Australia’s Food Standards Authority was forced to ban New Zealand apples following a labelling scare.
The Food Standards Authority said that apples were incorrectly labelled because they were being processed with Australian apples. The New Zealand apples had been processed in Australia, but incorrectly labelled as originating from New Zealand.
The problem was caused by a lack of proper labelling and inspection.
However, the issue has created controversy among politicians and the New Zealand Apple and Pear Growers Council (NZAPGC).
The NZAPGC has said that the issue was “overblown” and that no New Zealand apples have been exported into Australia.

Government told to pay Burnside legal bill
by Paul Smith | Burnside & Mount Horeb News
The government must pay the legal fees of Burnside’s lawyers in the legal fight over the future of the council, according to the head of a government department which gave the council the green light for its controversial amalgamation.
Government officials have failed to pay the legal costs of Burnside’s legal team since April, despite telling the council in July that they would. The government initially refused to pay the bill despite agreeing to do so.
The cost is now estimated at $300,000. The Burnside City Council has applied to the Supreme Court for a cost order against the government, which means the government would have to pay Burnside’s legal bill.
In a written submission to the Supreme Court, which was due to hear the application this week, Justice Minister Simon Power told the court that Burnside’s legal costs were “appropriate",2011,Politics,-579565568.0
"18 January 2011 - drought water policy unsuited to flooding
Flooding has been the worst drought killer this summer in Victoria. While floods may be a rare occurrence in Victoria, they are a common occurrence across the rest of Australia and the drought policy needs to address this fact. The Victorian Government has already indicated it intends to re-think its drought policy as a result of this summer's floods. The Federal Government has yet to respond.
Drought policy is focused on the period of reduced rainfall, with drought water allocation policy geared to water saving and water rationing. A flood policy would be directed to flood control and prevention and water recovery and replenishment.
In 2005 the Victorian Government adopted the concept of a'managed wetland' in the River Murray and Goulburn Valley. These are wetlands where flood water is allowed to flow through to the ocean or to the Murray-Darling Basin.

"05 July 2011 - governments urged to consider tolls
By The Economist 05 July 2011
TAXING ROADS can be a contentious business, particularly for politicians. For many, the principle of paying for roads by charging motorists is anathema. Some people may be opposed to paying a toll to use a road that they do not own, or for which they do not have access. Other motorists may simply resent the idea of paying for the use of a road that they are free to use at any time and that is open to the public. But as The Economist’s special report “Toll roads” suggests, the case for paying for roads has become much more convincing over the past decade. The report says that roads are an important tool for stimulating growth and that the revenue from road tolls is not that different from the cost to governments of providing and maintaining roads. Moreover, the benefits to the environment and the economy, as well as to individual motorists, can outweigh the costs. The report looks at the various approaches to charging",2011,Politics,-584112128.0

"22 September 2011 - asylum policy debate rages on without settlement plan
A key question in the asylum debate has been whether refugees should be able to settle in Australia. The federal government has argued that settlement would be an impractical option, since Australia has only 60,000 available housing units. This, it argued, would require large numbers of refugees to be resettled in regional areas. The Greens argued that such a settlement plan is necessary to achieve a fair refugee policy and that it would be better for refugees to settle in Australia than in refugee camps.
The federal government has recently argued that a settlement plan is not necessary and should be rejected. Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young criticised the federal government's arguments and pointed out that there is no guarantee that housing would be available if a settlement plan is adopted, arguing that it is the responsibility of the government to ensure adequate housing for refugees.

If there are big losses for the party, the state leadership told the federal party, they would hold them to account.

17 August 2011 - government confident of cigarettte packaging laws
The government is confident that legislation to require cigarette packets to be more graphic and contain health warnings will be passed through parliament despite strong opposition from the industry.
The Health Minister, Tony Ryall, and the Prime Minister, John Key, yesterday spoke out in favour of the proposed legislation and against criticism that it was a government backdown over anti-smoking efforts.
The legislation will not include the removal of the names of manufacturers from packets, or an increase in the size of health warnings, and will still allow cigarette companies to show logos and images on packets.
But the legislation will include a graphic image of a dead person or someone with lung cancer on each cigarette packet, with a 75% increase in the amount of space given to warnings.
The proposal is designed to deter young people from taking up smoking and has been strongly opposed by the New Zealand Cigarette and Tobacco Growers' Council.

us backs ban ki moons re election bid - BBC News : ""The United States has urged the UN to support South Korean president Lee Myung-bak's re-election bid.
It said the result of the poll on 12 December would reflect the will of the people.
South Korea's opposition has called on the US to stay out of the election.
The US, which is South Korea's biggest aid donor, said it was not intervening in the election. ""
It was not surprising to see the US intervening on behalf of Lee Myung-bak as Lee has always been an American puppet.
Lee's main election promise was to 'bring peace to the Korean peninsula' and I think this is why the US is supporting his re-election bid.
The South Korean opposition has alleged that Lee is trying to take South Korea into the North Korean sphere of influence.
I do not think that the South Koreans want to be part of North Korea's sphere of influence as this would have a knock on",2011,Politics,-586381184.0

A number of people were killed and dozens were wounded in clashes between security forces and thousands of protesters in Sanaa and Taiz.
