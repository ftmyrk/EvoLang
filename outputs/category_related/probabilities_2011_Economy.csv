Market overstocked with pomegranate and grapefruit
With the season for pomegranate fruit and grapefruit already in progress and nearing its end, market supplies have seen a considerable increase. Fruit producers have been delivering their production at the markets to stock up on supplies and in this way have managed to sell off the surplus.
It has been reported that pomegranate supplies have reached up to 100 tonnes per day at various markets throughout Turkey and have led to a considerable surplus in stocks. Grapefruit and other citrus fruit have also seen an increase in the supply of up to 200 tonnes per day. It has been reported that the increase in market supplies has led to a considerable decrease in the price of grapefruit.
There has also been an increase in the number of exporters, including Ege Fruit, who have been supplying to markets in England. It has been reported that pomegranate fruit is priced at 12.5 TRY (approximately 5.2 EUR",2011,Economy,-578278912.0

I just read a blog written by James Kirby, a young Sydney based graphic designer. In it, he discusses the importance of developing an understanding of design in order to be able to read it. He goes on to discuss the fact that the world's best design is invisible - which is something I've discussed previously.
But James also discusses the way that designers work - how they create the visual language that is used to communicate ideas, and how important it is to have a good understanding of this to be able to critique and assess the way in which designers work.
It's something that's worth thinking about as we move forward.

That is, even if we do have inflation, it's quite possible that the rise in the CPI (or any other price index) is simply a 'transient' phenomenon.

THE world economy may be in the doldrums, but that is not a cause for celebration as a slump would hit exports and add to our own recession, Treasurer Wayne Swan says.

""It's time for us to enjoy it while we can,"" he said.
""The last thing that Australia needs is to be dragged into another global economic crisis.""
The federal government has previously warned that another global recession could tip the nation back into recession, as has happened in the past.

Avo growers have backed a move to have kiwifruit pay a marketing levy. The levy would replace the existing 2.4% tax and would be paid by kiwifruit growers in return for more investment in marketing the fruit.
The proposal was presented at the first meeting of the kiwifruit industry marketing review group since the 2011 season got under way.
In the last season, the industry body, Zespri, was given the responsibility to promote kiwifruit around the world and has set a target to lift exports from the current $200 million to $400 million.
A marketing levy was also suggested by a Zespri levy review group after the 2010 season.
The review group has looked at different ways to fund the levy including levies from different fruit varieties and an annual levy.
The meeting of the marketing review group has heard that the levy should be introduced as a permanent, fixed rate and be based on the value of all kiw",2011,Economy,-589526912.0

The growth of the UK economy was weaker in May than the average for the past 18 months and was led by the services sector.
The ONS’s gross domestic product (GDP) estimate for May was 0.3 per cent, while the average growth for the past 18 months has been 0.5 per cent. This figure compares to the ONS’s estimate of 0.8 per cent in April.
The ONS said growth was mainly due to an increase in services activity, driven by a rise in retail sales, but this was partly offset by a fall in manufacturing output and public sector spending.
A separate set of figures from the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) showed that the sector was the weakest performer in the UK’s economy in May.

This is the slowest growth rate since the third quarter of 1999, when growth was 9.2 percent.

The move is another blow to the government, as it comes only weeks after Moody’s Investors Service downgraded Australia’s debt rating, citing a growing budget deficit and higher government spending.

One of the best ways to get a competitive edge over your competitors is to use your best product.
It could be something simple such as a new product line or a new technology that your competitors don’t have yet.
You can use your best product as the cornerstone of a marketing campaign to promote your brand.

In our view, a number of factors have combined to push prices lower in recent weeks.
First, there has been growing uncertainty over global demand for corn, with the US Census Bureau reporting that export demand for the grain in July was down 13% from June. This has caused the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) to reduce its export estimate for the season to 30% below its June projection, while the International Grains Council (IGC) has also reduced its estimate of global demand by 3% for the same period.

Austrian-based metals explorer Aurubis said the dip in gold prices was “no cause for concern” as the firm continues to build up its gold reserves.
“The gold market is highly sensitive to macro-economic factors and any significant move in the markets, good or bad, has a disproportionate effect on the gold price,” Aurubis chief executive Mark Hough said.
The Federal Reserve in the US last week announced a $600bn plan to purchase long-term US government bonds. While it may be intended to stimulate the economy by providing banks with more funds to lend, the plan is also being seen as an attempt to prevent a global depression.

A recent decision by the government to relax the rules on migration into the UK could be the only means of staving off inflation in the short term, according to a leading economist.
According to John Pullinger, the former chief economic adviser to Gordon Brown, the country is headed for an 80-year-high inflation rate. To combat this, the government has made an “incredibly bad” decision to increase the number of workers in the UK. The Labour MP said this could provide a “modest stimulus” to the economy.
He told The Independent: “There is only one thing that can stave off inflation in the short term, and that’s a huge increase in immigration. But the government has made an incredibly bad decision on that.”
However, he added that while immigration would be helpful, it could not be allowed to get out of hand. He added: “You have to get the balance right. I think it is very much a balancing act to get it right.”

Investors are still awaiting the latest inflation figures in South Africa and are looking to these figures to see whether or not they have been affected by the rising prices of crude oil and other raw materials. There is speculation that the latest inflation figures are going to cause a slight uptick in interest rates, especially since inflation remains in a 6% to 6.5% bracket. The recent announcement that the Central Bank will continue with its monetary policy of inflation targeting, is likely to keep the interest rates in the region of 5% to 5.5% for the rest of this year, according to analysts at Standard Bank.

Posted by David Smith on Wednesday, 15 September 2011
The all-ordrers index rose 0.73% or 47.0 to 6,468.7.
The market breadth ratio rose to 1.19. That is the number of stocks rising over the number falling. The market breadth ratio is a measure of the extent of the market's participation.
The number of stocks rising is usually a good indication of whether a market is topping or bottoming. This is because the market breadth ratio is also affected by liquidity.
If a market is topping, there is often increased volatility and a lot of trading, which can result in a larger number of stocks rising. On the other hand, a market that is bottoming usually has fewer stocks rising than falling.
The market breadth ratio also rose on the previous trading session. On Thursday, the market breadth ratio had fallen to 1.01, which is below the long-term average of 1.10.

European debt and its potential ramifications for markets was a hot topic on Monday. A strong rally in the greenback drove the dollar up against most other currencies, dragging the euro and other commodities down. On Friday, Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke said that the Fed would not be reducing its stimulus program for the time being. The dollar was helped by speculation that the US central bank would begin reducing the amount of bond purchases, which has helped to drive the greenback higher against the euro. Meanwhile, markets are awaiting the US nonfarm payrolls report, due to be released later in the week. This is seen as a crucial indicator for the strength of the economy and is expected to show a rise in jobs over the month of June.

CHINA’S ECONOMY SPEEDS UP ADDING PRESSURE TO GLOBAL RECOVERY
By The Financial Times (http://www.ft.com)
China’s economy grew 8.9 per cent in 2010, the fastest pace since the government relaxed economic controls in 1978.
Official figures showed that the world’s second-largest economy grew 9.7 per cent in the fourth quarter, well above the 8.7 per cent increase recorded in the third quarter. It is also faster than the increase of 7.2 per cent recorded in the fourth quarter of 2009.
Chinese growth has been under pressure this year, with exports falling in December, prompting the government to step up stimulus measures.
“China has taken some action, but more is needed,” said Xie Yaxuan, chief economist at the Bank of Communications in Beijing. “It is difficult to see how the economy can maintain a 10 per cent growth rate this year.”

The rural property market is not moving, with farmers not feeling confident enough to sell their properties, says Bayleys’ rural property specialist, Tim Cuthbert.
Mr Cuthbert says that the main reasons for the lack of activity is because farmers are still waiting for a clear signal that the global economy is picking up, but that signal has yet to be provided by the international banks, who are still not lending to most rural farmers.
“There is also a lack of confidence in the land market and with the Government not helping the farming community in any way and in fact reducing support for them, it’s unlikely that the current market will change in the foreseeable future,” he says.

""However, it is no longer immune from sustained budget pressures or the fiscal disruptions associated with political and social unrest""

Greens and Labor Senator Penny Wong and Independent Senator Nick Xenophon have joined forces to call for the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to investigate whether supermarkets are exploiting citrus farmers.
The call comes as prices for navel oranges have fallen by 40 per cent in just two weeks, to 35 cents per pound for a sizeable fruit.
Senator Wong says supermarket power has led to growers in South Australia being forced to accept prices that are far below those being paid by other retailers for oranges.
“These farmers are being ripped off, and they should not be left to fend for themselves.
“Labor and the Greens are calling on the ACCC to launch an investigation into whether supermarkets are exploiting farmers and driving them out of business.”

The ACCC alleged that from August 2005 until January 2009, Franklin’s Supermarkets Limited, together with several of its wholly-owned subsidiaries, entered into several contracts with retailers and wholesalers. The contracts set a resale price for a range of fresh, chilled and frozen meat and fish products.

Mango growers in Queensland's Wet Tropics have voted overwhelmingly in favour of paying a levy to market and research their fruit.
The Growers Association of the Wet Tropics is a small, not-for-profit association formed by growers to market and promote mangoes grown in the region.
The group was formed by growers who wanted to market and promote mangoes from their region but who could not afford to do it on their own. A levy was put to growers in the region as a way to fund these activities.
At a meeting on Saturday, 19 growers in the region voted on whether or not to pay the levy. A show of hands at the meeting revealed 29 for and one against, giving the group a clear mandate to go ahead.
The association was originally formed in 2009, but growers in the region are now feeling more confident about the group's potential to help market their fruit.

"06 May 2011 - inflation threat lifts rate rise risk
Household finances have been under pressure for more than a year now and the Bank of England is keeping a close eye on consumer confidence. However, inflation is rising again and may make a rate rise in June more likely.
April saw the first rise in inflation for almost two years. This is partly down to the rising price of energy. This is in part due to the impact of the rising price of crude oil which has made energy bills more expensive. This rise is likely to be temporary and will have an impact on inflation figures in the short-term.
However, the rate of inflation will remain a key concern for the Bank of England. Inflation remains low and there is concern that rising consumer prices could trigger an unwelcome rise in borrowing costs and lead to higher mortgage rates and a further increase in the cost of living. This could be damaging for consumer confidence.
The Bank is keen to avoid the return of deflation which would be bad news for consumers and businesses.

In its application, AGASA argues that supermarkets don’t provide any services to consumers and are a conduit for profit, while fruit stores offer consumers expert advice and assistance with their selection. They also offer fruit-related products, such as cuttings, pots and compost.
In its response to the AGASA application, the Competition Commission states that the application “raises a number of policy, legal and regulatory issues of a highly contentious nature”.

Dissatisfaction with supermarkets has come to a head, says the National Farmers' Union, after it emerged that Asda is slashing prices on a range of products.
The price war could mean farmers lose more than a million pounds each in sales, according to the NFU.
The retailer is cutting prices on products including margarine, chocolate spread and toilet rolls, the Daily Mail reports. 
NFU President Peter Kendall said:
""Farmers have become increasingly frustrated with the supermarkets and their behaviour in recent years.
""This most recent move by Asda is yet another example of them trying to cut into the profits of farmers and manufacturers by putting prices down.""
The NFU says farmers have had to absorb high costs to protect food supply, such as higher fuel prices and soaring energy bills. 
Meanwhile, farmers are warning against the idea of introducing a European minimum price for milk.  The idea is being pushed by the French, with a view to keeping the price of milk in France high.

Posted by: molly
The French government has taken aim at the British economy, warning of the dangers of a second round of quantitative easing by the Bank of England and accusing the UK of having a “lack of solidarity” with the rest of Europe.
The warnings, made by the French finance minister, Jean-Pierre Raffarin, follow similar criticism this month from Germany’s finance minister, Wolfgang Schäuble, and the head of the IMF, Christine Lagarde.
The latest attack came at the launch of a report from the French bank BNP Paribas. The report warned that a second round of quantitative easing in the UK could damage the global economy, but it also said that a “recessionary spiral” was a real possibility for the eurozone, and the best way to prevent it was for the UK to take a more active part in European co-ordination.

Chinese commodities spurs on local market
The recent strong rally in the Shanghai stock market was attributed by many analysts to the fact that Chinese companies are in a much stronger financial position than those in the US and Europe.
While many western economies are facing a recession or worse, Chinese companies are able to continue expanding in the face of strong demand from the local economy and growing demand from the rest of the world. This is due to the fact that China is in a strong position to export commodities and to supply the world with products such as electronics and consumer goods.
With many western economies suffering from high unemployment, consumer confidence and household disposable incomes are falling. In contrast, China's economy is continuing to grow and its population is still relatively young, meaning that demand for goods and services remains high.

The rural property market in Queensland is in decline according to the latest REIQ Rural Market Report for October.
Rural residential sales recorded a monthly fall of 19.7 per cent while rural commercial sales dropped by 30 per cent.

The Reserve Bank of Australia says the Australian economy has picked up pace this year, but risks remain.
The bank has decided to leave its official cash rate unchanged at a record low 4.5 per cent.
The RBA said today the economy has expanded at an annualised rate of 4.25 per cent in the June quarter, but is forecast to grow by 2.75 per cent in the September quarter and 3.5 per cent in the December quarter.
It says that is a bit above the bank's forecast of 2.5 per cent for the year.
But RBA Governor Glenn Stevens warned the economy still faced risks.
He said the global economy was growing more slowly than expected and there were concerns about the outlook in Europe.

As we reported last week, the greek elections are the most important elections since the world war. They will determine whether greece is to default on its loans or not. And with 13% unemployment, the greek economy is not in a good shape to handle a default.

WA pork producers have been left in limbo after a decision was taken to freeze pork marketing fees at 40 cents per kilogram at a meeting in Kalgoorlie on Tuesday.
The meeting was called to address the escalating cost of the feed for pig farmers and ensure the pork industry in WA remained viable.
The decision was reached at a meeting of the Pork Industry Council on Tuesday in Kalgoorlie, after a request by pork producers to raise the marketing fee by 10 cents a kilogram.
The Pork Industry Council president David Johnson said the decision to freeze the fee was due to the state government's failure to consult with pig producers on their concerns about the cost of the feed.
He said the pork industry had seen a 15 per cent increase in the cost of feed in the past 12 months, and an 11.7 per cent rise in the cost of fertiliser over the same period.

The results are based on research conducted by the recruitment consultancy Hays.
Senior market analysts and market risk managers are required to maintain a detailed knowledge of the financial markets. They analyse information and translate it into recommendations for investment, and they also play a vital role in advising the firm's risk management strategies.
The research found that demand for these roles is currently outstripping supply, and that the skills of those with a broad knowledge of both fixed income and equity markets are particularly valued by firms. Respondents cited a shortage of senior level fixed income and equity market analysts as well as market risk managers as their biggest skill shortages in the sector.

The European Commission is due to present its proposal for a new banking union by the end of July, which is then due to be reviewed by the Council of Ministers. The ECB is likely to adopt the necessary regulations by the autumn.
The next steps are to establish a common deposit insurance system and a single supervisory mechanism. This will require new rules to ensure that banks operate under consistent conditions, that supervisory authorities have the necessary powers, and that there is a proper separation of duties between the ECB and the national authorities.
The Commission’s proposal on deposit insurance could be in place as early as the autumn, and will need to be in place by early 2013 at the latest.

Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan said on March 13 that he expected the country’s economy would recover from the quake and tsunami.
“Japan will certainly bounce back after this natural disaster,” Kan said, adding that he believed the earthquake was the strongest ever measured in Japan.
Kan said on Sunday that he would not resign despite calls from a senior Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) lawmaker to do so in order to stop the government’s “ineffective” response to the crisis.
The prime minister’s announcement came after a weekend in which a senior cabinet minister said Japan was “likely to run out of power” and as a crisis panel headed by former Japanese Prime Minister Takeo Fukuda warned that nuclear power plants might face “unpredictable” risks.

We were informed last week that a local supermarket had been broken into in the night, resulting in thousands of pounds of damage. This is the second major incident in a month at a local business premises. On Friday 10 June, thieves broke into a local fishmonger's shop and stole 6 bags of fish from the display cabinet. In both incidents, the perpetrators managed to enter the premises via a rear door, despite both premises being equipped with 24 hour monitoring systems and secure door access systems.

Tight budget will hurt: RBA
The Reserve Bank says the federal government's new budget measures will hurt the economy in the short term, as the cost of living increases.
The Bank's quarterly financial stability review says the government's decision to introduce a fuel excise rise from October and to change the carbon tax rate will add an extra $18 billion to the budget deficit next year.
The fuel excise rise is expected to cost drivers $6 per week and will be partly offset by a lower rate of carbon tax from next July, which will cost consumers about $400 next year.
The review warns the government's plan to introduce the carbon tax in stages will also have a cost, as industries adjust their pricing and operations.
But the Bank says the government's decision to increase the superannuation guarantee will boost the budget by about $8 billion over the next two years and will help to reduce the budget deficit in the long term.

The research found that the number of African governments turning to African governments for help in building up their own economies had doubled since 2000. The World Bank’s contribution to Africa had fallen by a third in that time, and it is likely to drop further.

UK inflation hit a 15-month high in March on rising fuel prices and food costs. Inflation is still low by European standards but the rise was enough to put the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) back into action, with some members calling for the Bank of England's base rate to be increased by 0.25%. However, many analysts believe this is unlikely as the central bank is unlikely to raise interest rates unless there is a marked improvement in the UK's economy.
Inflation was 4.4% in March - the highest since December 2009. Economists had expected inflation to rise to 4.1% in the month, which would have been its highest level since September 2009.

The 2011 truffle season is well under way in Italy and although the weather has played havoc with the truffle growing season, it seems that overall there will be a reasonable crop of truffles for the winter. For the truffle growers, the 2011 season is a very mixed bag. With an abundance of rainfall over the truffle growing period, the truffle growers in the Marche, Abruzzo and Puglia are extremely happy that the weather has helped the truffle harvest, but in other parts of Italy the rainfall was far too much and it has meant that the truffle crop will be very small in the north and in Tuscany.
There is little that can be done to improve a poor crop, but if the growers had their way they would have changed the weather to improve the crop.

After a sharp increase in the value of the Dow Jones index yesterday (25 April 2011), a more than 400 point decline today (26 April 2011) left many investors asking why. However, according to an article published in the Wall Street Journal (26 April 2011), the decline was actually related to two other events.
First, the news from Greece, that it had actually managed to secure a loan. This is important as a large number of people and companies had been counting on the Greek debt crisis, if it got out of control, to send shock waves through the Euro zone and have negative consequences for all the Euro area economies. In other words, a large number of people, including banks and other financial institutions, were taking a defensive position on Greece as a result of concerns about the Euro area debt crisis. Hence, as soon as the news that Greece had secured a loan broke, people started selling and shares and other financial instruments began to decline.

Japan pumps millions into economy
Japan's prime minister pledged Wednesday to pump in at least $80 billion in a new stimulus package aimed at shoring up the world's second-largest economy, which was hard hit by the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami.
Speaking to a joint session of parliament, Prime Minister Naoto Kan said the package was designed to support the country's economy through the current fiscal year that ends in March 2012.
""Let us do our utmost to overcome this emergency together,"" Kan said in the Diet, Japan's parliament.
In addition to the stimulus spending, Kan said he would seek to further loosen Japan's fiscal policy by reducing the size of the budget deficit.

The RICS global housing market survey shows that global fears are slowing the housing market.
UK and global housing markets are slowing down due to concerns over economic growth. A total of 57% of estate agents in the UK said they expect the housing market to strengthen in the next three months.

In Europe, house prices are expected to fall again in the coming months according to 58% of estate agents. Only 4% of respondents in the UK expect house prices to fall.

The UK economy has slipped back into recession, falling 0.2% in the last quarter of 2010. This marks the second time in just over two years that the economy has fallen into recession. In fact, it is only the third time in the last 25 years that the UK has entered and left recession so quickly. The fall is partly due to the 1% fall in exports and the 0.5% drop in production (the only time production has dropped since 1955). The decline in exports was probably due to the weaker euro and the fall in production was caused by weaker demand for car production.
The economy is also suffering from a lack of investment, which is dragging down the level of output.

CGRF grape growers have voted in favour of a Direct Supply Agreement (DSA) between their co-operative and the nation’s leading supermarket chains Coles, Woolworths, ALDI and IGA.
The agreement will provide for direct sale of grapes from Central Australia to these four major supermarket chains.

By JESSICA WASSERMAN, FT.COM, 27 JUNE 2011, www.ft.com
Banks across Europe, including Greek lenders, are among the weakest in the world, according to an analysis of credit spreads by Moody’s.
The analysis shows that investors are pricing in a 50 per cent likelihood that the Greek banking system would default in the next 12 months.
Moody’s said investors should take a cautious view of the sector. “The European banking sector has seen some very difficult times in recent years,” the agency said in a report released on Monday. “The financial crisis has led to a severe decline in financial conditions for banks in many parts of the world.”

The panic was driven by a combination of concerns about the Euro and the Greek debt crisis. The problem with this panic is that it is one of the more easily avoidable panics.

Bernanke’s comments drag us stocks lower
This morning’s comment by the US Federal Reserve chair, Ben Bernanke, suggesting that the US may be in the early stages of a recession has pulled us stocks sharply lower. It is certainly an unusual thing for Bernanke to say – he has previously argued that a recession would be unlikely to materialize in the US. But it is consistent with the fact that the US is already in a recession, since it is very hard to have a recession in the absence of a housing bust. And, as I’ve noted in the past, the Fed’s policy of keeping interest rates too low for too long to encourage housing speculation is a key driver of the recession that we are experiencing.
So far, I believe that the stock market is underestimating the probability of the US economy returning to a state of sustained growth in the foreseeable future. We are in a situation where we need some sort of shock to pull us out of recession,",2011,Economy,-585456768.0

New research by the Investment Association reveals that 61% of the FTSE 100 have now signed up to the “Stewardship Code” – a voluntary set of principles designed to improve the way companies engage with investors. The code was launched in April and aims to ensure that companies are being treated fairly by investors and also that investors are making the most of their voting rights.
2. This week, the UK government has announced that they will introduce new legislation in April 2012 to ban the use of “naked shorting” in the UK equity market. This means that a firm must have all shares they borrow in hand or have them available to be delivered before the transaction can be settled.

Greek referendum ignites German anger; hammers markets
German anger at the Greek referendum igniting the eurozone crisis is fueling the rally in the DAX.
German Bundestag member and former finance minister Hans Eichel has called for a European “moral outrage” to stop Greece voting against the terms of its rescue package.
The former SPD finance minister is one of the first senior politicians to react to yesterday’s announcement by the Greek government that it would hold a referendum on the terms of its rescue package and that it would reject the terms on offer. The proposal is widely expected to be rejected in a referendum which would then lead to the country’s exit from the eurozone.
Eichel is a long-standing advocate of German policy in the eurozone. He has consistently argued for tough action to force Greece to live within its means and to reject calls for debt write-downs and bank guarantees. The former finance",2011,Economy,-587620800.0

This is in spite of the Bank of England's surprise announcement that it would be injecting further funds into the economy by buying long term bonds. The market reaction to this was initially positive, with the FTSE rising by 1.2%, but it has since fallen by 1.6% at 3:00pm, as investors await confirmation of the news from the Bank.
The FTSE is currently down 2.1% on the year, compared to a 10.6% fall for the FTSE100. The FTSE250 is down 2.8%, as the mid-cap index continues to struggle against the backdrop of weak consumer demand. This week sees the publication of first quarter figures for the British Retail Consortium, which will no doubt add weight to the current downward trend in UK markets.

Supermarkets accused of copycat branding
The British Retail Consortium has called on the Competition Commission to ensure supermarkets don’t use competitors’ trade marks as they launch their own ranges.
A BRC survey of 100 brands suggests that Tesco is most likely to have copied a competitor’s branding, and that it most commonly copies its own brands as well as that of rivals.
It says that retailers have also failed to comply with rules which require them to apply for permission from trademark holders when launching their own ranges. The report shows that 30% of retailers launched a new product without permission from the trade mark owner, which could lead to an infringement action.
The BRC says that if competition laws were improved then the market for new products would be boosted.
Commenting, Helen Dickinson, Director General of the BRC, said: “Our research shows a worrying level of non-compliance and we will be writing to the Competition Commission with our concerns.

Australia's GDP fell 0.6% in Q1 compared to the December quarter.
The Bureau of Statistics today revised down the previous estimate of a 0.2% fall.
This means Australia's GDP in Q1 2011/12 was down 0.5% on a year ago.
The fall was the first quarterly GDP contraction since Q3 2010.
This was due to an ""unusually severe"" weather event that hit Q1 2011/12 - including floods and a cyclone in Queensland.
This is the first time since 1989 that weather has been blamed for a fall in GDP.

As a result, we have taken the difficult decision to restructure our business in the context of a new business model that will allow us to better adapt to the current economic climate.
It is true that we have been able to control costs. In fact, we have reduced costs by around 10 million euros in the second quarter, although the reduction in costs is not enough to make up for the negative impact of a lower level of demand.

The United Nations' climate change conference has been plunged into chaos after the US and Canada refused to sign a deal on emissions cuts, leaving negotiators facing the prospect of a total breakdown in the talks.
Australian climate change negotiator Ross Garnaut told the ABC that it was the first time he had seen a climate conference collapse.
""I can't remember any other time when the whole negotiating track has collapsed,"" he said.
Mr Garnaut said he had expected the US to sign a deal but the Americans and Canadians refused to compromise on the issue.
""There was a real sense of a deal being done and suddenly we had a breakdown,"" he said.
US and Canadian delegates were reportedly angry that the world's biggest emitters - China and India - had not been required to cut their emissions, while other countries agreed to do so.

UK wind power developers are being encouraged to sell or farm out their projects as falling wind power prices create a buyers market for offshore farms, according to a report from financial services company, RBS.
The report states that the combination of low wind power prices, which have fallen 25% from last summer’s highs, and low interest rates means that developers are now able to borrow money at less than 3% which is about half the cost of borrowing from a bank or building society.
In addition to this, a report published in January by energy firm, Drax, also noted that prices for offshore wind projects have dropped significantly since they were first announced.
The firm’s report also found that interest in these wind farms from potential buyers has increased from £1.7bn in 2007 to £7.3bn today.

The Australian Bureau of Statistics is expected to report tomorrow that the CPI inflation rate was 3.5% in the March quarter 2011.
This result is expected to be slightly above the Reserve Bank's inflation target of 2 to 3% and therefore will lead to an increase in interest rates from 4.75% to 5.00%. However the RBA has previously stated that it would only be prepared to increase interest rates by 25 basis points at a time and as such there is little scope for a significant rate increase from this point. Any additional rate hikes would probably be driven by a strong economy rather than a strong inflation rate.
At 4.75%, the cash rate is now at its lowest level since March 2009 and the current inflation rate is not at an all time low. Although the RBA may be concerned about the current high levels of Australian debt, this concern is not likely to result in a significant increase in interest rates.

“The economic benefits of housing development are well known and we see this in the way house prices rise over time and in the boost they give to the construction industry. But the growth in housing is also the main driver of the growth in carbon emissions,” she said.

Stocks rise as oil prices and dollar weaken, but euro stays low
European shares rose on Monday, recovering some of last week’s losses after oil prices declined and the dollar fell to fresh 16-year lows against the euro.
Markets were helped by a recovery in oil prices after crude touched an 11-year low on Friday on fears of a glut of supplies.

"14 September 2011 - rise in consumer confidence despite global economy
The latest consumer confidence figures from GfK show a small increase in the proportion of people expecting the economic situation in the UK to get better. This is despite the global economy showing signs of weakening.
This small increase is a welcome sign of consumer optimism, but is tempered by the fact that the proportion of consumers expecting the economic situation to get worse has risen to its highest level in over a year. The figures show that although the UK economy is improving slightly, the global economy is weakening and consumer confidence is being dampened by these uncertain times.
It is also worth noting that consumer confidence is only one part of the equation, and that consumer spending is being held back by a large increase in interest rates and the rising cost of goods and services. As the cost of living rises, consumers have less money to spend, which will impact on both consumer confidence and consumer spending.

David Cameron has warned that the eurozone crisis could blight the global economy if the UK fails to get its house in order and if the European Union fails to find a way to deal with the economic problems.
The prime minister was speaking at a summit in Brussels where the European Council and the European Commission outlined plans for the EU’s financial sector following the financial crisis.
The plans aim to ensure that no financial institution becomes “too big to fail” by introducing a new rule, called the macro-prudential rule, that will apply to institutions that pose a threat to the financial stability of the whole EU.
Cameron said the UK government was pushing for the UK to be excluded from this rule, as the UK government has already introduced a similar rule to protect the financial system.

Economy experts label government's surplus pursuit as crazy
Economy experts have labeled the Government’s pursuit of a surplus next year as crazy. Speaking at the NZ Institute's conference in Auckland today, former Treasury Secretary Ralph Nielson says the Government is going to have to take a massive hit in its current fiscal year. The Treasury estimates this year’s spending and revenue will be in balance, which is the current budget balance. “The only way to get a surplus is to cut spending, which is not going to happen. It’s an impossible dream.” “So, they’re going to have to go to the market, and take a haircut and borrow money at high rates of interest. That will affect New Zealanders. It’s not a good idea.” Mr Nielson says the Government has no choice but to change course and start spending money, because it’s not going to be able to get a surplus anyway. “The problem is, they can’t afford to spend.

Sovereign debt worries: A'real risk' for Australia
by Stephen McDonell, ABC News - Tuesday, 12 July 2011
The European sovereign debt crisis has rattled Australia's financial markets and economists say it's a real risk for the nation.
Economists say if the debt crisis worsens, Australia's exports and investment could be affected.
Economist Andrew Mills says there are three reasons for this.
""Firstly, if European economies are less willing to spend or import, that will obviously affect the growth prospects of Australia,"" he said.
""Secondly, Australia is exposed to commodity prices through the exports of our mining industry.
""We produce 30 per cent of the world's supply of coal, 17 per cent of its iron ore, 15 per cent of its bauxite and over 10 per cent of its alumina.

So, to the point, the news was that the IMF had just downgraded the Greek economy by 4% and that the Greek deficit was set to increase by 4% in 2011 and 2012 (from 6.2 to 10.5% of GDP), while the deficit reduction target was set at 7.0% by 2012 (from 8.5% of GDP). As the IMF expects a recession to follow the adjustment measures, this means that the Greek economy will be hit by a double whammy: a cut in exports (due to the crisis in Europe) and a cut in demand (due to the austerity measures).

The Fed has made it clear that it is not planning to buy Treasuries. The Fed has indicated that it would prefer to buy bonds that are closer to the money markets. There is concern in the bond markets that the Fed would buy bonds that are very close to maturity. This would put downward pressure on interest rates and potentially cause them to fall too low.

The devastating earthquake in Christchurch and its aftermath is expected to hit the New Zealand economy, with the country's GDP to be downgraded by up to 0.5% in the next two quarters.
The estimated 0.5% loss is due to the loss of output in the Canterbury region and the impact on the national economy, including business confidence, the RBNZ said in its quarterly Monetary Policy Statement.
In its Monetary Policy Statement the RBNZ said that in the event of a 0.5% hit to GDP, interest rates are likely to be unchanged until 2012. It added that there was a strong possibility of higher unemployment as a result of the quake and that measures such as the wage subsidy and employment incentives may be needed.
