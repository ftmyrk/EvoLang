27 November 2021 - The New Zealand Herald
A former New Zealand cricket player believes the national game has ""a very long way to go"" in terms of inclusivity and he's called on the country's current leaders to ""get their arse in gear"" and make change happen.
In an interview with The Herald, Craig McMillan, a former Black Caps captain, believes New Zealand is a cricket country that ""doesn't look like it"" and that's ""a bit sad"".
He has been an outspoken advocate for change in the game and the first Kiwi cricketer to publicly come out as gay.
And he's not convinced the country's current cricketing stars are up for making any major changes either.
He said he has been ""shocked"" by the lack of action from players who are on the world stage and in a position to make a difference.

AFL football officials have raised their concerns about new draft rules that could leave them with limited options to select players of African and Indigenous heritage.
The AFL's rules governing the draft - which determines the order in which clubs can select players in the annual draft - have been significantly overhauled.
The most significant change is the introduction of a single priority pick, which the AFL believes will ensure clubs can access elite talent in the draft and make more strategic selections.
The changes, which were passed in the 2019 season, have created controversy, with many players of African and Indigenous heritage arguing the rules favour clubs in the most successful leagues.
The AFL said the new rules would ensure clubs had an increased opportunity to select elite players, while also increasing the level of competition in the league.

Cricket Australia CEO Nick Hockley said that CA would support any cricket initiatives South Africa could undertake within the country and the broader region.
