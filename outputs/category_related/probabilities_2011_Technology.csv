Insurers are likely to come under scrutiny when the floods inquiry hears that the insurance market is not working well enough. The insurance market was one of the areas highlighted by the chief secretary to the Treasury, Danny Alexander, as an area where government policy must be scrutinised.
A government spokesman said that, if Mr Alexander's view was that there is a systemic failure in the market then he has a clear obligation to look at the policies we are pursuing, to see whether they are having the desired impact.

Bristol Crown Court has heard how a man escaped jail over a false alibi in the murder of Bristol pensioner Betty Betts.

It is estimated that 10-15 million passengers were affected, as air travel was suspended from several European countries.

"01 December 2011 - grain crops unscathed despite bad weather
Grain crops have come through the summer dry weather relatively well with little impact on yield and quality. However, this is not the case for livestock producers who are having to adjust their strategies to cope with the low feed prices. Livestock farmers and feed producers are looking for solutions that allow them to continue farming and reduce costs. As a result, several alternative feed ingredients are gaining popularity in the marketplace. These include wholemeal wheat, maize meal, and wheat straw.
Although there is currently a price differential between wholemeal wheat and conventional wheat, it may only be a matter of time before the two products become as popular as they were some years ago. “Although the price of wholemeal wheat is currently 50c higher per ton than conventional wheat, farmers are starting to use the wholemeal variety as they are realising that it does not reduce the yields of their crops. They also believe that it has greater nutritional value,” explains Piet Visser, manager at PWS Grain SA. “",2011,Technology,-582070848.0

It is unclear why the rabbit is so expensive, although the BBC speculated that the artist, Philip Mould, is well known in the art world. Mould was quoted as saying, ""I think this rabbit is really very clever.""
I find the painting fascinating. It is not something I would ever be drawn to, but I find it beautiful nonetheless. The rabbit has very bright eyes, and it is hard to look away.

Langerak could have no complaints about the goal as his outstretched leg was unable to keep out an acute angle shot from Jaturapat Satdumrong. Langerak has already conceded two own goals in the tournament which is an unwanted statistic for a keeper.
The Socceroos were dominant in the first half but were unable to break down the resilient Thai defence. A number of excellent saves from the Thailand goalkeeper resulted in a goalless half time score line.
The Socceroos came out strongly in the second half and applied the pressure to the Thai defence. They created a number of good opportunities but were unable to",2011,Technology,-595792256.0
"27 September 2011 - flood hero insurance claim denied
Today we heard that our insurance company has denied our claim, despite having made an initial offer of £20,000. In fact they have offered to pay a total of £4,000. They seem to have come up with this after seeing the photos from a few months ago of the damage done to our house and farm.
This is despite us having been flooded in November 2010 and the house has been repaired and rebuilt. But because we didn't do the repairs to the farm in November, because the insurers said it wasn't worth it, they have now said the farm is not covered by the insurance.
The flood damage to the farm, on the bank of the Severn, was enormous. There was flooding over the 200 acres of farm land, and we have had to replant over 50 acres of barley and turn all our livestock into a nearby field.

The man who found the light and the dark
I'm a huge fan of the Australian photographer Craig Thomson, and when I heard that he had just written a memoir, 'The man who found the light and the dark', I had to get hold of a copy. It is a beautifully crafted memoir which tells the story of his remarkable life and career, and it is full of interesting insights into the world of photography.
Born in Sydney in 1944, Thomson was raised by a working-class single mother who loved opera, the arts and beauty, and she instilled these values into her son, giving him a strong sense of self-worth and helping him to develop his artistic skills.
Thomson began taking photographs as a teenager, and his work was soon shown in galleries. He also attended the Sydney College of the Arts, where he studied drawing and painting, and his artistic talent was recognised when he won a prestigious scholarship.

The BBC has reported on the cancellation of a £25 million deal to develop a holiday resort on St Lucia's island of Martinique.

The idea is to connect the airport with the Metro rail line and extend it to the CBD.

By Patrick Lannin
The Minerals Council of Australia has warned that the proposed mining tax will discriminate against junior miners, despite the fact that there are no such companies in the mining sector. The council has urged the government to reconsider its proposal to impose a tax on mining companies with annual revenues of $1 billion and above, claiming that the policy will reduce Australia's competitiveness and undermine the country's investment appeal.
The minerals council also pointed out that the tax proposal will affect some of Australia's largest mining companies, including Rio Tinto, BHP Billiton and Xstrata. The council said that imposing a tax on such large companies will raise costs and reduce the level of investment. It warned that the tax will not necessarily raise revenue as companies may take some of their activities offshore. The tax proposal was one of the many measures the government has put forward in its May budget to boost the country's tax base.

"19 March 2011 - fur seals navigate bass strait pipes to haulout
An estimated 3000 fur seals arrived off Macquarie Island in the last few weeks and have begun to haul out on the beaches of the island. The haulouts are taking place on all of the north side beaches, with the most dramatic being the 100m high cliff face on the beach directly east of the research station.
The seals have travelled a great distance to haul out, and must navigate Bass Strait to get to Macquarie Island. They take the shortest route possible, and avoid major stormy seas, so their route will change depending on the weather. The fur seals are now at the start of the process of molting from their winter coats, which means they will be very vulnerable during the summer when there are no other animals to feed on.
The seals began to haul out on 1 March, and were joined by a second, larger, haulout in the same area on 12 March. These haulouts are the first signs of life on the",2011,Technology,-577404416.0

The Australian Steel Institute (ASI) has expressed concern about the impact on the steel industry of the new Western Australian Government's decision to increase royalty payments.
The ASI says that a rise in the royalty from five cents a tonne to six cents a tonne is a major blow to the State's $10 billion steel industry.
ASI chief executive Steve Gower says the impact on Western Australia's $8 billion iron ore exports will be minimal as the increase applies only to processed steel. But he says the rise will significantly reduce the State's annual $1.6 billion contribution from the steel industry.
Gower says the industry is already under threat from the rising price of iron ore and the weakening of the Australian dollar.

Insurance companies must be accountable for the extent of their coverage and the price they charge for it.
That's according to the chairman of the Insurance Council of Australia (ICA), who has called for the Government to use its inquiry into last year's floods as an opportunity to fix uncertainty in the insurance industry.
In an article published by The Australian, the ICA's Ian Leaver said the Government's Flood Inquiry needed to consider issues around ""coverage, affordability and accessibility of insurance"" for those impacted by the flood.
""Those affected should receive certainty and security that their claims will be paid out and that they will be protected from future claims in the same way as those living in high risk zones,"" he said.
""If they don't, there is a danger that insurance will be seen as a 'high risk' and it will be perceived as too costly and difficult to access.""

"20 June 2011 - stuntmen fail in oscars attempt
Yesterday we saw two stuntmen nominated in the Oscars. Today we saw the two of them fail to take the Oscar away from them. It's not the first time. They tried before and failed too. We should be happy for them, as it is a great honour to be nominated, but it's also a bitter pill to swallow. If there's one thing that should be taken away from this, it is the fact that stunt work is not appreciated. I'm not saying it's not, but I am saying that it's not appreciated enough. That's why they don't get the chance to win. It's also a shame for the film industry. If the Oscars are about promoting and praising the best of the best, then it's about time that more stuntmen are getting a chance to shine. It's high time the Oscars were given to the best stuntman, the best stunt crew, or at least the stunt work that made a film shine.

28 November 2011 - farmer claims own testing finds gm canola present
The Canberra Times, November 28, 2011, p 3
The federal government should suspend canola sales because contamination of the crop by genetically modified (gm) varieties has not been eliminated, a farmer says.
Farmer and Canola Council of Australia chairman John Murray says the situation remains so dangerous that he is worried for his farm's future.
He is concerned about the increasing amount of GM canola found on farms and in his crops.
""I've got GM contamination in my canola this year and last year and the year before and the year before,"" Mr Murray told the Fairfax Media.
""It's not a one-off. It's a consistent problem. I'm very worried about it.""

We are a few days away from the digital TV switch over to free to air digital signals and already, problems are emerging, particularly in the Sydney metropolitan area. Digital TV is expensive and requires an upgraded digital receiver which costs between $100 to $300 (more if you want to be able to record TV shows). Most Australians have been forced to pay for the expensive digital TV boxes or lose their free to air TV.
Some of the big television companies (like Foxtel, the major free to air broadcasters, the Seven Network, Nine Network and Ten) are already saying that the switch to digital free to air TV signals is not worth the money. Foxtel and the major free to air networks have been charging their viewers for digital TV for over ten years, yet these companies have made billions of dollars. Ten has made a lot of money because they only have a handful of television stations in Australia and have used their monopoly to charge viewers for digital TV.

Now in 2011, the commodity is surging even higher, in the first two months of the year, with the World Bank estimating an increase of 7.6% on the first two months of last year. So why are water prices continuing to soar, and how are companies doing to cope with the challenge of water scarcity?

A British man who downloaded thousands of indecent images of children was fined £5,000 ($8,000) and put on the sex offenders register for two years after he admitted 35 charges of downloading child porn and possessing thousands of indecent pictures and movies.
The Daily Mail reported that the man, 26, was convicted by a court in Leicester, central England, after a week-long trial that heard he had 5,000 images and 4,000 videos of child abuse.
Prosecutors said the man used his mobile phone and the internet to download the material, including movies of children aged under 12 being sexually abused. The man told the court he had downloaded the material because he was fascinated by it.

It's reported that a cross border rail link has been dropped from a study examining the future of the Irish railways. The link was planned to link Drogheda with Dundalk via Drogheda, with the intention of running services through Dundalk station, then to Belfast and to Dublin. However, there are not enough train movements to justify the cost of running services to Dundalk on the route that was planned. Instead, the study suggests using the old DART line that has been disused since 2004. This line would link Dublin to Drogheda and would not have required as much money as the proposed direct route to Dundalk.
It would be good news for the Drogheda Railway Preservation Society if the DART line was used as a replacement for the planned link to Dundalk. The society has campaigned for many years for a new DART line that would link Drogheda with Dublin.

An angry councillor from the City of Casey has been sprayed with a water hose over her claim the municipality was over-charging residents.

Mrs Sutherland said some residents were over-charged after being incorrectly given a water consumption rate based on the size of their house.
The council had written to them in August 2010 saying their water bills were high because they were using more than 300 litres per day.
Mrs Sutherland claimed a number of residents had received letters from the council saying they would be charged a rate of $4.75 for every 300 litres of water used, as well as a $75 administrative charge.

In 2003, the Queensland dairy industry was given $50 million in government funding for an intensive farming development program, which included plans for a large new dairy farm at Murgon.
On the face of it, the project made sense. At the time, the dairy industry was experiencing high demand and low supply, with milk prices at record highs. This was the perfect opportunity to invest in more cows and expand the industry.
However, this investment came at a huge environmental cost. Instead of investing in drought proofing, water retention and water filtration, the government instead pumped a large amount of water into the region, knowing full well that the river system was not equipped to cope with this sudden influx of water.
The river system did not cope and the result is the worst ever water quality disaster in Queensland's history. The droughts and floods have created a perfect storm for toxic algae, causing the worst water quality issue in Australia in recent times.

building standards hailed as boost for disabled children
A new standard for the construction of buildings is expected to make it easier for disabled people, particularly children, to access public facilities.
New standards for the design of buildings will help to make it easier for people with disabilities to use public places.
The standard, which is being drawn up by the British Standards Institute (BSI), will ensure that buildings have access for people with disabilities, including children.
Under the standard, which is expected to be finalised by the end of the year, building developers will be required to ensure that doors and stairs are wide enough for people with mobility difficulties, such as wheelchairs, to get in and out of buildings.
Additionally, ramps will be required so that wheelchairs can get into and out of buildings, and toilets and sinks will need to be installed in such a way as to allow disabled users to use them.
BSI will also be introducing a code of practice to explain the standards in more detail",2011,Technology,-606929920.0

A convicted paedophile has been bashed by fellow prisoners for allegedly filming a young girl at the shower block of the maximum-security Port Augusta Prison.
The 40-year-old man, whose identity is protected, was convicted of possessing child pornography in 2003 and sentenced to 18 months jail in the District Court.

Brisbane, Australia, 14 January: The Brisbane Roar had their 10-match unbeaten run in A-League halted when a penalty from Central Coast Mariners striker Daniel McBreen earned the home side a 1-0 win.
The match was goalless at the half-time break, but just after the break the Roar's Michael Zullo was penalised for handball, allowing the Mariners to break the deadlock.
The Roar had several chances to equalise, but could not find a goal. Their goalkeeping duo of Michael Theoklitos and Liam Reddy failed to hold on to balls coming into the penalty area, and the Mariners were able to play the ball around.

Act Program to Teach Trainee GPS
The ACT Government's new GPS (GPS) program will be launched on Thursday 9 September 2011, in Canberra.
The program will teach students from Years 3 to 12 how to use and care for a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver to find and record GPS coordinates.
GPS is an essential technology that is used by many people every day, from those who work in mining, farming, construction and emergency services to tourists and amateur astronomers.
GPS systems are also widely used in the surveying, geodetic and cartographic industries, and by the defence and security forces. GPS receivers are commonly used by travellers to navigate unfamiliar roads, find the best route and estimate the distance to the next service centre or rest stop.
The ACT Government's new GPS program will enable students to experience how GPS technology works, develop their understanding of how GPS coordinates are measured and help them use GPS coordinates to find places on a map.

Isa and back to visit family, but in the end decided to stay local and visit a winery in the Swan Valley for the weekend. We thought that driving through the countryside to the winery would be a good experience, so we decided to do it in a road train, with the dogs in the middle, instead of taking our camper trailer.
I have to say that we were very surprised how many people were travelling in road trains on the weekend. We were passed by three of them in a row and were only about an hour from Perth. I think we must have done something right as we were overtaken by an extremely long road train of six trailers. We drove about 400km that day and took it very easy as it was the first time that we have done that distance in a road train.

As a direct result of our campaign, the NSW state government has agreed to the introduction of a minimum 4 hour safety stop on all coal trains passing through Dubbo, at a cost of $150 million. This will prevent 20-30 coal trains a day from passing through the centre of Dubbo.
While we welcome the commitment from the state government, this is not enough. Our campaign for an end to coal trains is not over and the state government is only providing 4 hours for the trains to stop at the same place they currently stop for 1 hour, so the train will be on the tracks for at least another 10 hours. These trains still travel at 100kph for hours on end and our community is still facing significant risks from these trains passing through Dubbo, particularly the increased likelihood of derailments.
The government has made the decision to increase the safety stop on the basis that the trains will continue to operate through Dubbo",2011,Technology,-575701248.0

It's a case of deja vu for the Queensland Government and Santos, as yet another native title claim has been lodged over a site for a major gas hub on the border between Queensland and New South Wales.
The Federal Court is being asked to recognise the right of the Kamilaroi people to be consulted before the land is developed for a proposed gas hub, located in the northern part of the state's rich coal seam gas region.
Lawyers representing the Queensland Government, the Santos Coal seam gas (CSG) project, and the New South Wales Land and Property Information Office, argue that the land in question was never part of the traditional Kamilaroi country, and the claim is therefore without merit.

Dr Nick Hobbs of Newcastle Universitys School of Environment and Science warns that the campus at Ourimbah remains at risk from bushfire and climate change impacts, despite a change in the campus bushfire plan.

A man has been jailed after pleading guilty to causing death by dangerous driving.
Sergei Maksimov, 44, killed 24-year-old Daniel Whittaker in a collision in Aylesbury in October 2010.
Mr Whittaker, a lorry driver, died after his car collided with Maksimov's Vauxhall Vectra as he overtook him on the A41.

Aylesbury Crown Court heard Maksimov, of no fixed abode, had 29 previous driving offences.

The caica is made of two planks of redwood or other strong, durable hardwood. These planks are glued together and bent into a flat-bottomed canoe shape by a combination of heat and steam. When the canoe is bent, the wood fibers are stretched, making the caica stronger and more durable.
In the 17th century the caica was the only craft capable of transporting heavy loads across the Caribbean Sea.

A 10.5% increase in the levy on livestock and sheepmeat sales at the 2011-12 state budget will make it impossible to meet funding requirements and will have a detrimental effect on saleyards, says Livestock SA.
The organisation has released a report on the impact of the levy increase which it says will add an additional $8.4 million to the cost of running the state's 22 saleyards and market centres.
The report found that the levy would have a devastating effect on small towns, putting the viability of the livestock industry at risk.
""If the levy goes ahead, 60 per cent of South Australia's regional livestock sales will have to cease,"" said Livestock SA president John Vukadinovic.
Livestock SA estimates that the increase will have a major impact on local economies, particularly in small regional centres, where 80 per cent of livestock sales are conducted.

Wife and daughter of diver who died in 2003 still waiting for compensation
THE wife and daughter of a West Australian dive enthusiast who died in 2003 are still waiting for a $5 million compensation settlement.
The West Australian, the South Australian and Victorian coroners' courts found in 2005 that an offshore dive trip had been a success before the 41-year-old man drowned and his body was never found.

The future for many people affected by the May 2010 flood disaster is uncertain following the latest planning permission setback.
At a public inquiry held earlier this month, Greenwich Council Planning Committee refused permission for a new housing development at the centre of the flood zone. In doing so, it ruled that the site, in Charlton, had a significant flood risk and could not be developed at present.
However, the site owner, Taylor Wimpey, has appealed against the decision to refuse and it will now be decided by an independent planning inspector.
Cllr Darren Merrill, Deputy Leader and Cabinet Member for Housing and Regeneration said: “We are pleased that Taylor Wimpey has appealed against this decision, but we want to remind people that flood risk remains an important issue for this area.

A new law comes into effect on December 1 that will see fines of up to $5000 and six months in jail for truck drivers who fail to take regular breaks. The changes to the road transport laws in Queensland are the latest in a series of efforts to curb dangerous fatigue among truck drivers.

fire in rainforest anathema or saviour?
We are all familiar with the destruction of tropical rainforests by slash-and-burn agriculture. For a brief moment the forest is scorched and burned. The charcoal is sold and the ash used as fertiliser. The soil remains behind, but the trees and undergrowth are lost for ever. However, in the past ten years or so, a new way of using fire in tropical forests has been discovered. It is a more sustainable way of working, and one that can be used in forest preservation.
A team of American and Australian scientists discovered in 2000 that when certain species of trees are burnt, the ash they produce has the effect of protecting the seedlings of other species, as well as those of the trees that are burnt themselves. This means that after a forest fire, the seedlings that sprout from the seeds can grow to maturity, protected from competition from other plants. The scientists also found that fire can increase the",2011,Technology,-595403136.0
"26 September 2011 - other countries interested in plain packaging laws
The Canadian Medical Association has supported a campaign for plain packaging for cigarettes as a way of fighting tobacco addiction.
The group’s submission to the Standing Committee on Health says that the proposal “would encourage a shift away from the emphasis on packaging and branding, which serves to glamorize and promote tobacco use, and on health care costs”.
“Although Canada has taken strong and progressive measures to reduce the health burden caused by smoking, such as banning tobacco sales in public places, implementing plain packaging could significantly reduce the consumption of tobacco in Canada.”
“Tobacco use is one of the greatest causes of preventable illness and death in Canada, and plain packaging would likely reduce the prevalence of smoking, decrease the demand for tobacco, and reduce the amount of money that smokers spend on tobacco. This in turn could lead to savings in the health care system and in the tax system.”

The first pirate to be convicted in a US federal court on Monday received a 30-year prison sentence.
Former radio show host Joel Tenenbaum, who was found liable for copyright infringement in a civil case brought by the recording industry, has until now refused to accept responsibility for his actions.

The veteran's representatives will argue that, despite the Government's declaration that the veterans are ""special"", the federal Government has been slow to implement the support mechanisms it committed to when the network was closed in 2007.
Under the terms of the closure, veterans were to receive $5,000 a year for five years, and priority health treatment, with any claims to be investigated by an independent body.
The Government was also to provide a website to support the former radio operators and their families.
Veterans have complained that the process has dragged on for four years and that the Government has reneged on its commitments.

"25 July 2011 - childcare uncertainty sparks call for funding boost
The cost of providing childcare has been the subject of a new report from the Social Market Foundation (SMF). The report by the think tank says that the average cost of a full-time place in a nursery in London is £12,000 a year, which is higher than in the private sector and is out of reach of many working families.
The SMF argues that the funding provided by the government to childcare providers is insufficient to keep up with rising costs, and this is leading to providers having to either reduce the numbers of children they can look after, or increase fees to compensate for the reduced income. 
The report suggests that the government should consider a subsidy to cover the full cost of childcare, so that parents are not disadvantaged by having to pay for childcare, while providers are not subsidising the childcare sector themselves.  The government should also consider the introduction of childcare vouchers, which would allow the tax system to play a role in reducing childcare costs. The government should also consider how it",2011,Technology,-595219584.0
"27 October 2011 - miner to appeal against native title ruling
The Queensland Government is to appeal a recent decision by a federal court that miners were not required to get a licence to access native title land, despite a 1992 mining agreement.
In June, federal court justice John Dowsett handed down a landmark decision that the mining companies had no legal obligation to obtain a licence under the Native Title Act to access land for mining.
The decision is the first to be made in an appeal against the validity of a mining claim made under the Mining Act 1992 and is likely to have major implications for other mines operating under similar agreements.
The decision followed an agreement between the government, the Queensland Coal Miners Association and the miners over land ownership in the Bowen Basin.
The miners argued that the mining claims were valid because they were granted before the Native Title Act was passed in 1993, and the courts agreed.
The Bowen Basin Land Access Association (BBLAA) and the Indigenous Land Corporation (ILC) are to appeal against the decision.

Mr. Mark G. O’Neil, 45, of Oceanside, California, was sentenced today to 25 years in federal prison after pleading guilty to participating in a conspiracy to commit armed robberies in Long Beach and Los Angeles County.
According to court papers and statements made in court, O’Neil participated in armed robberies of several businesses in Long Beach and Los Angeles. The robberies took place between January and March of this year. At least four businesses were robbed, including a nail salon, a dry cleaner and a convenience store. Several businesses were targeted again, but the robbers were unsuccessful in their attempts to rob them.
The investigation into the robberies began when a local business owner contacted the FBI Los Angeles Field Office with information concerning the robbery of his business.

"15 October 2011 - coal seam gas protests in newcastle and maitland
The Sydney Morning Herald is reporting that there are mass protests over coal seam gas in Newcastle and Maitland.
About 500 people gathered in Newcastle today to voice their opposition to coal seam gas mining. Demonstrators said the coal seam gas industry was a threat to the Great Barrier Reef and water supply.
The protest was called by Friends of the Earth, the Sierra Club and other groups. About 100 people rallied in Maitland, calling for a halt to coal seam gas and shale gas exploration.
Environmentalists claim that coal seam gas extraction uses toxic chemicals which contaminate ground water. They claim it could destroy the Great Barrier Reef by causing water to run hotter and more quickly.
The mining industry says that the process is environmentally sound and poses no danger to the environment.
At the protest in Newcastle today, a spokesman from Friends of the Earth said the coal seam gas industry is being promoted as the solution to Australia's energy problems, but it is not.

On 20 July 2011, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission announced its decision that there is no need for further action to ensure competition in freight services in the Victorian grain industry. The ACCC investigated the grain industry following the Australian Competition Tribunal's findings in Graincorp Ltd, GrainCorp Pty Ltd and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (Respondents) v Grain Industry Co-ordination Council, 2010 AT 13 (Tribunal) and concluded that the Victorian grain industry does not have competition problems and that there was no need to impose any further remedies on the parties.

"07 November 2011 - anf claims on nursing assistants dishonest
The Federal Commissioner for the Protection of Privacy (anf) has recently published information on the misuse of nursing assistants. According to the anf, in 2010, nursing assistants were misused in the private nursing sector 1.9 times per week. In the care sector, misuse occurred once every three days. In the statutory health insurance sector, on the other hand, nursing assistants are usually treated respectfully. According to the anf, the private sector is characterized by a high turnover of personnel and thus the occurrence of abuse. In the statutory health insurance sector, the anf states that nursing assistants who work with the same colleagues in different nursing facilities, thus receiving similar working conditions, are less often misused. The anf also refers to the fact that private nursing facilities do not always provide appropriate facilities and training opportunities. According to the Federal Minister of Health, private facilities do not have the same training obligations as public facilities.

"11 August 2011 - bus drivers to stop work again
On 11th August, bus drivers from over 20 companies went on strike for the second time this month, after an agreement on pay was rejected by the bus companies.
The 24-hour strike will affect public transport in the region, including the London Underground. Services will be severely disrupted and passengers are advised to avoid using public transport.
The dispute concerns pay, which is lower than that of bus drivers in many other countries. The London bus companies are asking for drivers to work longer hours with less pay, in return for which they are being given more holiday.
Bus companies are not prepared to go into a new pay deal, because they are losing a lot of money and have been in profit for the past three years. The unions claim that the companies are making a huge amount of money and that it would not be difficult for them to pay bus drivers more money.
The bus companies are refusing to talk to the unions, and the Government is refusing to take any action, leaving the bus drivers",2011,Technology,-585468096.0
"22 November 2011 - dairy farmers concerns over cheap us milk
DairyNZ is concerned cheap U.S. milk is threatening to undermine New Zealand’s dairy export returns.
New Zealand’s Fonterra has agreed to sell a further $1.5 billion worth of milk products to the U.S. supermarket chain Walmart. The deal is on top of the $2.8 billion in milk products already sold to Walmart.
The move is worrying dairy farmers as it is thought that Walmart will buy milk at a price below the current level of NZD $6.00 per kilo.
DairyNZ’s National Dairy Manager, Michael Brooks, said there were many implications of cheap U.S. milk.
“If U.S. milk was purchased below $6 per kg it would seriously undermine the return on farmers’ investment and it would also make it more difficult for dairy farmers to invest in their farms and meet future demand,” Mr Brooks said.

A federal judge in California has ruled that the state’s same-sex marriage ban remains on hold, but he also ordered officials in some counties to perform weddings for same-sex couples.
In his 75-page ruling, Judge Vaughn Walker said he wants to consider whether to dissolve the ban on gay marriages. The ruling came Monday in a case challenging Proposition 8, the 2008 ballot measure that banned gay marriage.
The court order directed county clerks in five counties to begin performing same-sex marriages immediately. Other counties were directed to start within the next week.
The judge said he would review the matter at a hearing Tuesday.
Gay marriage in California was legal from June 16, 2008, until a November 2008 voter-approved ban took effect. Gay couples can obtain a marriage license, but not yet a marriage certificate, because the state Department of Public Health does not recognize the licenses.
