England tops cricket rankings
England has moved to the top of the ICC ODI rankings after beating India in the first ODI at Trent Bridge on Wednesday.
India won the toss and elected to bat. It was a good decision as England had a brilliant bowling performance with Chris Tremlett (2-32) and Graeme Swann (2-27) bowling well. The England bowlers were good throughout the match and had a good economy rate of 3.27 runs per over.
India's top order batsmen were not good and India lost their top three batsmen for a score of 32 in the 9.1 overs. India batsman Gautam Gambhir (2) and Virat Kohli (4) fell early to the English bowlers and there was little chance of India reaching the total.
India captain MS Dhoni did not bat and was caught by Jos Buttler (2) off Graeme Swann.

Fixing of a match by some of the cricketers from Pakistan in 2010 has left the fans of the cricket disappointed as they have seen their favourite sport becoming tainted.
Match-fixing is a crime that is being perpetrated against the innocent and honest players who give their time and energy to the game in order to bring joy to the fans.
ICC has been working with other anti-corruption bodies to clamp down on the fixing and this has resulted in some of the big names from Pakistan to be banned from the game.
The recent example of Umar Gul who has been banned from the game for six months after being found guilty of being involved in match-fixing is a strong message to the others involved in the game to desist from doing the same.
This is an important development in the history of the game and shows that the ICC is serious in clamping down on match fixing and is not going to let it go any further.

STUART CLARK has quit state cricket, putting his international career before his career in the Sheffield Shield.
The 27-year-old from Wagga Wagga will miss the Sheffield Shield final, his first Test match against Pakistan at the Gabba and the Test against India at Adelaide Oval. He will, however, continue to play in the domestic Twenty20 competition.
Clark said yesterday he had decided to give up the Shield, which he had been playing for NSW since 2003, because his cricket in the domestic competition was not getting any better and he was getting older. It is the same reason that Australia’s two other regular one-day batsmen, Michael Hussey and David Hussey, are not playing in the",2011,Sports,-588767872.0

Australia continued its winning streak with a comprehensive 3-0 victory over Saudi Arabia at Stadium Australia last night.
It was the first of three matches Australia will play in a week, ahead of its opening match in Group B against Korea Republic on Wednesday.
The win was also Australia’s 100th at home, having won all of their previous 99 home games.
The Socceroos had to wait until the 31st minute to open their account.
A quick passing move out of defence saw David Carney set up Alex Brosque, who shot into the net past the goalkeeper from 10 metres.
It was Brosque’s third goal of the tournament, and the first for him in the competition since 2007.
In the 35th minute, Brett Holman fired a shot from 18 metres that flew over the head of the Saudi goalkeeper and bounced into the net.

A teenager whose football career was on the line after being given a two-match ban has avoided any action over a foul which saw his ankle turn.
The 14-year-old was dismissed after kicking an opposing player in the back of the ankle in the space of a second during a game between two junior teams.
But he was cleared by a tribunal of the Football Association, which regulates all aspects of the game in England and Wales, after his defence argued that his punishment had been too severe.
The boy, whose name is protected by a court order, was playing for a team based in Essex against a club from the south coast in March when the incident occurred.
He had been playing in midfield when, as the ball went over his shoulder, he lashed out with his right foot.
His ankle was twisted and he was sent off by referee Kevin Broughton, who decided the offence was so serious it would carry an automatic two-match ban.
It was the first time the youngster had ever been sent",2011,Sports,-589178048.0

"24 May 2011 - bellerive plan becomes political football
The bellerive plan to extend the golf course has become a political football in the lead-up to the election. The plan, if implemented, will require the government to purchase 20ha of land and the golf club to purchase another 8ha. The cost to the government is estimated at $3.5 million. But the plan has sparked concerns about public access to the area and is now being challenged by a community group.
Bellerive Community Action is a group of 80-90 local residents who met last week to discuss the issues and are currently considering legal options to oppose the government’s proposed plan. The group is also opposed to the golf club purchasing 8ha of land from the government.
The government is proposing to buy the land and give it to the golf club. The government argues that this will provide public access to the land. However, the group argues that public access to the land will be very limited and that the land should be used for other public uses.

The Olympic stadium in east London has just undergone a complete makeover to prepare it for the opening ceremony on 27 July 2012. The building is currently undergoing a £25 million facelift, which includes replacing the wooden benches and adding some VIP seating to make it more comfortable. But what is really exciting is the work to the roof, which is to include the first 'trampoline' style roof for a major sports venue. The roof will allow spectators to be able to look straight up, giving a much more dramatic feel for the event, while still making sure the stadium's iconic design is retained. The roof will feature 1,000 trampoline units, which will look like a giant, undulating, fabric roof.

As a football historian, Paul Kennedy is well placed to tackle the origin of the game. In a new book, he explains how the ball's shape was a far more important factor than where it was first kicked
The game of football was first played in England in the 12th century. So says the great football historian David Goldblatt. He has just written a book to prove it, and he can do so with an air of authority, because he is a professor of English literature and he has written about football before. His argument is not that the game originated in England, but that it was played first there, and in the game's earliest form.
The fact that it is hard to agree with him makes this one of the most interesting and fascinating books I have read for a long time.

It is official. The London 2012 Olympics torch has been unveiled. The torch, designed by David Pearce, is in the shape of the iconic Olympic rings. I like the fact that it is simple. I would have loved it if it could have been in the shape of the Olympic rings with the Olympic logos on them, but there's no doubt that it will work as a symbol. In my opinion the torch should be more than just a torch. It is a symbol of the Olympics and I think it should be simple but very meaningful.

Socceroos coach Ange Postecoglou says there was no shortage of options when he selected the young squad to play Macau on Monday night.
The young Socceroos defeated the Chinese Taipei Football Association (CTFA) 5-1 in the first qualifying match for the 2014 AFC U-19 Championship in Thailand on Friday.
The squad was the same for both matches as Postecoglou was keen to keep the players together for the whole of the Asian campaign.
Postecoglou’s final 23-man squad to play Macau was comprised of the 11 who played against CTFA on Friday plus five more, all from the 21-man squad that beat Kuwait in the Asian Cup in September.

"07 April 2011 - cricketer bowls miracle over
In a cricketing miracle that has gone viral on the internet, a player on the field of play in Sri Lanka has managed to bowl a no-ball and a wide all in the same over. The incident happened in a game involving the Galle Cricket Club against the Galle United Cricket Club on April 2.
The first instance occurred in the third over of the Galle United innings when a ball was bowled by Ajantha Mendis and struck the batsman. Mendis, who is renowned for his freaky bowling, had already dismissed the batsman three times in the game. He was also charged by the International Cricket Council (ICC) for bowling a no-ball in the match.
The second instance happened in the fourth over of the Galle United innings when another ball was bowled by Mendis and was called a wide by the umpire. It was later revealed that this ball also was called a no-ball, but Mendis managed to bowl it legally, and in a",2011,Sports,-580604032.0

James Sutherland said it was ""inevitable"" that there would be a period of adjustment for the Australians as they played their first Test match in India since Steve Waugh retired.
Singh, who is a former India batsman, has been an assistant coach since November last year. Sutherland said he had done a ""superb job"" and could be a candidate for a permanent coaching role with India.
""Peter has been a great coach and done an outstanding job for us in the last 12 months,"" he said. ""He's a highly respected coach within Australia and internationally and we have no doubt that he will be considered for a senior role with India. It's not something we've spoken about and I don't think that he has either.

A goalless first half was enough for the Australians to run out comfortable 3-0 winners after goals from Tim Cahill (37' penalty), Luke Wilkshire (55') and Alex Brosque (68') secured the Socceroos' progression to the knockout stage.
The Socceroos came into the match off the back of a win against Jordan in their opening game, a victory that saw them top the Group C table.

Soccer Helping Refugees Settle in Australia
The Football Federation of Australia is encouraging Australian soccer clubs to take on a refugee team as part of the national body’s initiative to help refugees settle in the country.
Australia has a strong history of helping refugees settle into the country, as well as helping them find employment and become productive members of the community.
The Refugee Sponsorship Program (RSP) was introduced in 2007 by the government, and is run by the Australian Refugee Association. The program encourages sponsorship of up to 50 refugee families a year to settle in Australia.
Sponsorship is usually provided by local community groups or private individuals.
The RSP is a win-win situation for Australia and the refugees, as the latter receive valuable support and assistance with integration into Australian society, whilst the sponsors benefit from the assistance they are able to provide to their new family members.
A Football Federation of Australia representative said the program is a win-win situation for everyone involved, as the Australian",2011,Sports,-584313472.0

Posted: 11 January 2011
Soccer, or football, in Australia is in a state of crisis. It's on life support. The football federation is in a state of turmoil. The media have given up on the game and are not reporting any of the domestic games.
The Socceroos are struggling to win a game at home and have just been beaten by Bahrain in a World Cup qualifier.
I'm not going to make any more comments on the game as there are other more informed people who can do that better than I can.
I am concerned that if things keep going the way they are there is only one sport left for Australia.
Yes, Australian football has gone down the tubes. It used to be a great game. Now it's a joke. No one cares about it anymore. If you can't even sell 20,000 tickets to a game then",2011,Sports,-577574144.0

In the early days of the Celtic Church in Ireland, Gaelic games took hold in the area known as Dál Fiatach (The People of the Fort). It was from this place that the name of the Gaeil, or Gaelic people, is derived. In those days, it was the men of the Dal Fiatach who were known for their strength and bravery, and they were noted for their skills as archers and in hurling, as well as in handball and in wrestling. The men of Dal Fiatach were also noted for their skill at hurling, a game which involved throwing and catching a ball, and was sometimes called Ceol Rua, which means 'the red game.' The game of Gaelic football, however, was not invented until the 19th century, and it was not played by the people of Dal Fiatach.
