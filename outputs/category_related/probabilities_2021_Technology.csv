COVID-19 has been the biggest challenge of the new decade, and while Thailand was initially seen as an outlier in containing the spread of the virus, cases have been increasing since the beginning of November. The country has confirmed over 40,000 cases of COVID-19 to date, with more than 3,600 active cases, including nearly 1,100 infections in the last 14 days. Despite the growing caseload, the government has remained optimistic about Thailand’s ability to contain the virus, but experts say this is not the case. Here are 4 things you should know about Thailand’s COVID-19 situation:
1. What caused the surge in cases?
The increase in cases can be largely attributed to a combination of factors. As the economy began reopening in May, many people returned to their hometowns to visit their families, leading to an increase in the number of cases.

Unvaccinated patients on the Queensland transplant waiting list will be required to quarantine in Brisbane or the Gold Coast before their transplant operation can proceed, the state's top doctor has revealed.

A shipping container shortage has created supply chain snarls and price hikes for businesses in Australia as it continues to stoke the nation's economic recovery.
The shortfall of shipping containers is now so acute it's causing some ports in Australia to be unable to accommodate ships and delays for others.
It has forced many businesses to seek alternative solutions, such as building their own custom containers or leasing existing containers.
There have been shortages in the past, but never quite so severe as it is now, says Peter Harmer, president of the Australian International Freight & Logistics Association (AIFLA).
The AIFLA says in a statement that the shortage is causing widespread disruption in the supply chain.

There is no doubt that Australia’s decision to mandate code of conduct negotiations with digital platforms is welcome news for news organisations, and for the broader public sphere. In 2020, Australians watched an average of 24 hours of news each week.
In a time of increasing polarisation and misinformation, platforms need to take responsibility for the harmful content that circulates on their sites and be held accountable for the role they play in the creation of a toxic media environment.
While some Australian news organisations may be more inclined to criticise Facebook’s recent action than to praise it, it is clear that a concerted effort to get users to download Facebook Lite, a stripped-back version of Facebook’s mobile app, was designed to create a negative perception of Facebook.

In Australia, new parents are not only entitled to a lump sum paid parental leave payment from the government, they are also entitled to leave from work.
Most countries around the world have some form of parental leave for the parent or parents who stay at home to care for their child. In most countries it is unpaid leave.

Only three countries provide a paid parental leave of more than 18 weeks - New Zealand, Australia and South Africa.

A day in the life of a dairy farmer can look very different from day to day. But there are some elements that are pretty much constant. Whether you’re a dairy farmer in the south of England, or in Ireland, you’ll probably share some of the following experiences.
What’s a typical day like on a dairy farm?
Getting up at 6am and having a quick breakfast
The first thing to do is get up, put on a pair of wellies, get out in the yard and feed the animals. The cows need to be fed first thing in the morning and have access to their feeders and water buckets throughout the day.
It’s time to go out to the field. You’ll probably have milked the cows, fed them, and now you’re going out to the field. It could be that you’re working with the bull, which means he’s cal",2021,Technology,-596412352.0
"09 September 2021 - former apple daily reporters raise concerns over media ownership issues
The Financial Times recently reported on a new study by the University of Cambridge's Center for Science and Policy (CSAP) and Media Reform Coalition, which ""reveals the extent of the concentration of media ownership in the UK."" The study, ""Media Consolidation in the UK: Evidence from the 2021 Ownership Database,"" found that ""UK media ownership is more concentrated than ever before, with the top six companies owning 63% of the market.""
The study is significant because it reveals a serious problem that has gone largely unnoticed in the UK: the concentration of media ownership. It is also timely, given the growing concern over the increasing dominance of large, multinational corporations in the media industry. This trend has led to the creation of what some are calling a ""media oligopoly,"" which has serious implications for the quality and diversity of journalism.

A Malaysian man who argued that it was unjust to criminalise consensual gay sex won his fight to have the ban on gay sex overturned.
Mohd Nazmi Mohd Nasir, 32, was convicted and sentenced to eight years in jail in 2017 after he was caught in a sex act with his boyfriend.
He appealed against the ruling and had the case heard in court by a three-judge panel.
They decided to overturn the ruling on grounds that it was unconstitutional.
In December last year, they issued a landmark decision, stating that Article 12(4) of the constitution, which prohibits “gross indecency” between men, was unconstitutional and could no longer stand.
A government spokesperson said they would not appeal against the decision.

Taiwanese Agriculture Minister Chen Chi-chung said the move is part of the government's “efforts to prevent Chinese politicians from interfering in the island’s food supply.”

YANGON, Myanmar (AP) — Myanmar security forces detained Myanmar's civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi and her top allies early Monday, detaining them just hours after the military declared a one-year state of emergency to sideline the elected government and halt a political crisis in the country.
As Suu Kyi was detained, protesters poured into the streets and marched through downtown Yangon to protest the military takeover. Thousands also rallied in the commercial hub of Mandalay.
Suu Kyi and her allies were arrested by the military as the country's legislature was meeting, and lawmakers fled the halls and ran into a nearby church. Suu Kyi and her allies were immediately taken away, her party said, in what was the most dramatic move yet by the",2021,Technology,-612246272.0

andrew dettre and the idea behind the aisling
As we’ve explored in previous posts, the term ‘aisling’ is used to describe both the genre and individual poems which explore the Irish imagination and Irish history, and which, in turn, use this to explore issues of identity and belonging in contemporary Ireland.
It is a genre that has had an illustrious and varied history, which can be traced back to at least the 17th century, with the publication of Eoghan Rua Ó Duibhghearna, an early Irish-language work. It is a genre that has been written in both Irish and English. It is a genre that has been adopted by both men and women. It is a genre which has been influenced by both traditional and modernist movements. It is a genre that has evolved, expanded, been explored and reinvented over centuries.

"12 February 2021 - government resists change to royal commission youth bail laws
The government is resisting calls for urgent change to the royal commission youth bail laws after the NSW Court of Criminal Appeal on Friday said the laws were so flawed they risked breaching the rights of Aboriginal children.
The commission on Wednesday recommended sweeping reforms that would have seen all children in care in NSW treated like adults.
The proposed reforms would have required youth bail hearings to be conducted by specially trained magistrates and judges, and have increased the powers of a bail justice to extend bail for up to two years.
The changes would have ended the automatic 72-hour rule that all detained youth must appear before a magistrate, and would have given the justice the power to set bail conditions in relation to the child’s behaviour, and whether they are a danger to the community.
But on Friday, a majority of the NSW Court of Criminal Appeal concluded the laws were so flawed that they risked breaching the rights of Aboriginal children.

The council and the State Government have no plans to enforce the law, and they have shown no interest in protecting the tourism industry, even though there has been no new mining on the island for 16 years. The island’s economy is dependent on tourism.
In July 2018, the islanders met in a referendum and voted overwhelmingly against sand mining on the island, with more than 60 per cent of the votes cast in favour of the proposal.
The referendum was followed by a public meeting on the island in which the then Minister for Environment and Science Meaghan Scanlon stated that the referendum was a “mandate” to stop sand mining on the island.
The islanders also met with the council and State Government representatives in February 2019, with the islanders again being assured that the mining ban would be enforced.

In a study published today in the journal Scientific Reports, researchers reported the results of the first controlled experiments the Wombot ever conducted in a human environment. The results showed that the Wombot is able to navigate a wide variety of terrain on its own, and is able to find its way through even the most complex human obstacles.
The team trained the Wombot to follow simple commands, such as ""move forward"" and ""turn left,"" using a computer program. They then put the Wombot in a small room with a large number of obstacles. They asked it to move through the room, avoiding obstacles such",2021,Technology,-582629696.0

"20 September 2021 - how the chinese government sent education into a tailspin
There was a moment in the summer of 2019 when education in China appeared to be coming to a head. At an event in Beijing, education minister Chen Baosheng told parents, schools, students and teachers that the education sector needed to “be more open and competitive” if it was to fulfil its “core mission” of improving learning and student outcomes. As China’s economic and financial hub, Shanghai was the first region to see a shake-up of its education system under these changes. In October 2019, the city government passed the Education Reform and Development Plan (2019-2025), which focused on four main areas of education reform. These included reforming the way schools operated, introducing more flexible and personalised learning, creating an innovative education system and strengthening internationalisation.
The 12-point reform plan also included a call for schools to open up, with schools, universities and teachers to collaborate with each other and share resources. It promised a “new normal” of “flex",2021,Technology,-591286208.0

Tourette’s syndrome is a neurological disorder that can cause people to make repeated involuntary movements, sounds and phrases. These involuntary movements and sounds are called tics, and they can happen any time or place, even in the middle of a skate session. Skateboarding is a fun and exciting sport for anyone who loves it, but it can also be very stressful. There are many ways that tics can affect a person’s performance on the board and make it harder for them to enjoy their time at the skatepark. It’s important for skaters with Tourette’s syndrome to be aware of how their condition may affect their skating, and to take steps to make it easier for themselves.
The symptoms of Tourette’s syndrome can be quite varied and will depend on the severity of the disorder. In some cases, the symptoms may be quite mild, while in other cases they may be quite severe. It is important for people with Tourette’s syndrome to",2021,Technology,-631529856.0

Bookstores are facing the supply chain crisis ahead of Christmas as a shortage of books has hit high street shops.
As the new academic year draws to a close and the festive period approaches, it is not just the shelves of supermarkets that are empty as publishers and distributors struggle to keep up with demand.
The shortage, which has hit all industries from toys to toilet rolls, is partly down to the pandemic and the shift to online shopping, but it is being compounded by problems caused by Brexit and the war in Ukraine.
The books industry has been hit hard by the shortage of books and is expecting it to worsen ahead of the Christmas season.
A spokesman for Waterstones, the UK’s largest bookseller, said: “We are working with our suppliers and have taken a number of steps to reduce the impact of the shortage on our customers.

The University of Tasmania is using a $1 million smart irrigation grant to test the performance of its pioneering'smart soil' technology.
The technology, developed by the university's Institute for Integrated Water Infrastructure Research (IWI), could revolutionise irrigation.
IWI Research Professor Mike Rolfe said the'smart soil' technology has been trialled in several projects but has never been fully tested in an irrigation context.
""Our soil and irrigation monitoring technologies can be used together or separately to improve the efficiency of crop irrigation, increase productivity, reduce water use, improve soil health and reduce the risk of plant diseases,"" Professor Rolfe said.
IWI Research Fellow John McArthur said a significant limitation of existing sensors is that they are not waterproof.
""Soil sensors need to be placed in a protected location on a field to avoid damage from the elements. If they are buried they must be re-surveyed on a regular basis to find their exact location,"" Mr McArthur said.

There is no evidence that the current restrictions at 35 percent are having any adverse effect on New Zealand’s trade or economy, and any attempt to relax the restrictions would likely be resisted by the international community, a former official at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade says.
On Thursday, the Director-General of Health Ashley Bloomfield said that the Ministry of Health would not be asking the Government to increase the percentage of international arrivals from the current 35 percent.
But in an opinion piece published on Friday, the former Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade official says it’s a mistake to see the restriction of international arrivals to 35 percent as a barrier to New Zealand’s trade and economy.
“While there may be an argument to be made that the restriction on arrivals has had an impact on tourism, we have no evidence that the current restriction is adversely affecting other sectors of our economy.”

Victorians have been battered by severe weather this week, with 240mm of rain falling in just four hours in Gisborne on Wednesday, leading to flash flooding in parts of the state.
The weather conditions that have led to such dramatic events are known as 'bombogenesis' – a term that means an intense burst of cold air pushing up against warm air.
This intense cold air comes from the polar vortex, which is a region of low-pressure air in the Earth's stratosphere. This is similar to the warm tropical air in the lower atmosphere known as the horse latitudes, and can cause very different weather effects.

According to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI), the number of new infections has increased slightly in recent days. This is probably due to the Omicron variant, which is spreading in Germany. However, the number of new infections is still well below the previous peak, which occurred in February 2021.",2021,Technology,-452916864.0

The legal fees of ex-Army officer and federal MP Christian Porter have been partially covered by taxpayers in the federal government’s legal fight to quash the ABC’s broadcast of the rape allegations he faced as a 17-year-old.
The government said the amount, which is subject to legal privilege, was “relatively small” in relation to the ABC’s estimated $10 million bill for the legal battle.
The details were provided in documents lodged with the Federal Court as part of the ABC’s application to overturn a previous decision of Justice James Allsop that the broadcaster’s broadcast of Mr Porter’s defamation action was in the public interest.
In his 2019 judgment, Justice Allsop upheld Mr Porter’s case that the ABC had breached its duty of care by broadcasting allegations he made in a 2018 Four Corners program against former High Court justice Robert French and former High Court lawyer Martin Flanagan for raping",2021,Technology,-586295936.0

They will be working on other ways of trying to deal with the problems caused by the crisis such as dealing with the huge debts and the unemployment and so on.

I first heard it at a friend’s house party, and I was immediately transported to the club where the party was being held. The beat was driving and hypnotic, and the lyrics were catchy and relatable. I had to know who was singing it, and when I found out it was Adelaide-based reggae artist Adi, I knew I had to share it with my friends.

South Australia's Labor Opposition Leader Peter Malinauskas said the future of Whyalla Steelworks remained uncertain after the federal government announced an additional $70 million in funding for the site, but said it would not lead to new jobs or new investment.
Mr Malinauskas said the additional money was a drop in the bucket compared to what was needed.

"10 December 2021 - uk tribunal finds china committed genocide against uighurs and kazakhs
A UN tribunal has found China guilty of genocide and crimes against humanity against its Uyghur population in Xinjiang. It was the first ruling on the issue by an international court and will serve as a legal precedent for any other tribunal to rule on similar allegations.
Genocide, ethnic cleansing, and cultural and religious persecution were all found to be taking place in Xinjiang as China detained, forced labour, sterilised, and forcibly separated children from their families.
The ruling by the UK International Criminal Court of the Court of Appeal is binding for all UK courts, and it is likely that the judgement will be followed in other countries as well. The ruling says that the UN's Convention on Genocide is binding on the UK and that the tribunal had jurisdiction to decide on the case as it relates to the United Kingdom and is relevant to the UK's security and interests. This means that China can be held accountable for its actions in Xinjiang.

A few years ago, during one particularly hard winter, the creek was actually still flowing during a prolonged freeze when all the other streams and rivers in the area had stopped flowing.

However, the issue is that the covid-19 vaccine is only effective against the current strain, if that strain changes into a new one, this will make the vaccine useless. The government's plans to get the vaccination program rolled out have been disrupted by a shortage of covid-19 vaccine supplies. To counter this problem, the government is now considering making rapid covid-19 tests available free for all.

The Aussie is the second best performing G10 currency this week, behind only the South African rand. The US dollar is down about 0.6% in the past week.

After two days of hearings, Ghislaine Maxwell was due to return to court in New York for a second week of legal proceedings, where she will face further allegations about her conduct. She was charged with helping sex offender Jeffrey Epstein in his alleged sex trafficking of underage girls.
At the beginning of her trial last week, a former flight attendant testified that he saw Maxwell sexually abuse a minor.

If Donald Trump were to be impeached by the House of Representatives and then convicted in a Senate trial, it would be an unprecedented second impeachment.
For any president to be removed from office, a two-part process must take place. First, the House must pass an impeachment resolution. Next, the Senate would hold a trial. If a majority of Senators voted to convict the president, he or she would be removed from office and barred from running for the office again.
But Trump isn’t likely to face this scenario, given the narrow margin by which he lost the popular vote. So a House impeachment trial would not be a straightforward process. It would be more like a trial without a jury. A House impeachment trial could only remove the president from office if the Senate were to convict. And a Senate trial could only occur if a majority of Senators believed the president had committed an impeachable offense.

The government's plan to introduce a £15,000 degree has been met with fury from students who are already struggling to find work, according to The Independent. The plan to cap tuition fees for graduates at £15,000 will put thousands of universities at risk of closure, and students could be left with a massive debt of up to £50,000, according to Universities UK (UUK). The trade body said the move could lead to the closure of 300,000 places, the loss of 150,000 jobs and the end of thousands of research projects.

"05 November 2021 - fair work commission hands payday to harvest workers
Today the Fair Work Commission has handed a fair and reasonable wage increase of 3.7% to farm workers.
Harvest workers will get a real pay rise of $4.12 per hour, in recognition of the importance of these workers to Australia’s farming sector. In fact, these workers are the heart of the harvest.
This pay increase will be backdated to 1 July, and is also payable to seasonal workers, with harvest workers being a particularly important part of the seasonal workforce.
This will be good news for harvest workers, especially those on the West Coast. There are 1,500 workers employed on the West Coast in the current harvest, many of them migrants and backpackers. 
The Fair Work Commission’s decision recognises that harvest workers are integral to the success of Australian agriculture. They do hard, high-risk and highly valued work.
There is a real need to recruit more harvest workers. In 2021, we expect a further 1000 workers to be",2021,Technology,-586461120.0

What are the new COVID-19 restrictions for Victoria?
Here's a rundown of the new rules, as well as information about what it means for Victoria, Australia and the rest of the world.
Victoria will be subject to a 'total lockdown' from 11.59pm tonight. (Credit: NCA NewsWire/Glenn Hunt)
WHAT ARE THE NEW COVID-19 RESTRICTIONS?
The total lockdown in Victoria will see residents only allowed to leave home for four reasons.
They are to shop for essentials, exercise or for work. They also can attend a child care or educational facility or to care for someone who is sick.
People can travel to work if their employer can't do it from home. And they can also seek medical treatment, help someone else who needs medical care or help someone experiencing domestic violence or family violence.
The government said residents should only be leaving home for one of the four reasons, and not all four.

Ash Barty Begins Melbourne Park Campaign
World No.1 Ash Barty will look to continue her perfect start to 2021 when she begins her campaign at the Australian Open. Barty comes into the event as the favourite to take the crown after winning the 2020 US Open and the Western & Southern Open last year.
Barty was not able to defend her title in 2020 after the event was cancelled, so this will be the first time she has played at Melbourne Park since last year’s final. Last year, Barty came into the event as the top seed, but she lost in the final to Naomi Osaka, with Barty going down in straight sets.
Since last year, Barty has made a clean sweep of all three tournaments she has entered, including the Adelaide International, Brisbane International and Sydney International. She has not dropped a set in any of those tournaments, so will be looking to continue her excellent form at the Australian Open.

And then along came the Black Summer bushfires. But there’s always a silver lining. The bushfires provided a wake-up call for the sector to explore ways to diversify into the emerging space of agritourism, according to a new report, ‘Agritourism: Diversifying after disaster’ by Dr Jocelyn Mawdsley and Dr Ben Doherty, researchers at the National Centre for Engineering in Agriculture.
This report, commissioned by Hort Innovation and produced in partnership with the National Centre for Engineering in Agriculture at the University of Sydney, provides an overview of agritourism and case studies of farms that have adapted in this space.

A funnel web spider is a poisonous arachnid that is found in Australia. They are known for their aggressive behavior and painful venom, which has led to several human fatalities. A team of scientists at the University of Adelaide in Australia is studying the venom of funnel web spiders and has discovered that it contains compounds that could cause heart attacks.
In a study published in the journal Nature Communications, the team of scientists led by Dr. Mark Buller from the University of Adelaide’s School of Chemistry and Physics, studied the venom of the funnel web spider ( Atrax robustus ). They discovered that the venom contains a protein called R-RP8 that is able to block a key enzyme in the heart. This enzyme, called cardiac phospholamban, is responsible for the uptake of calcium ions into the heart muscle cells. When this enzyme is blocked, it leads to an increase in calcium ions inside the heart cells, which can result in arrhythmia and ultimately a heart attack.

He has also criticized the use of masks and social distancing measures, saying that they are unnecessary. Instead, he has urged Brazilians to return to work and school.

He was only ever interested in the idea of the country being “open” to business. The idea that the UK government would not have been open to business if Cummings had stayed in the country and got infected is ludicrous, but it is also a clear admission that he was only ever interested in business.

The captaincy for the Constellation Cup is chosen by a process that involves a vote among the players. However, the selection of the vice-captain is not so democratic. Instead, it is up to the head coach to choose who he or she feels is the best candidate for the role.
This process has been criticized as being unfair, as it gives the head coach too much power over who is chosen to be the captain.

The move sparked fury from China, which claims Taiwan as part of its territory and has threatened to annex it by force if necessary.
A statement from China's Foreign Ministry described the comments as ""a serious violation of international law, a gross interference in China's internal affairs and a serious challenge to China's sovereignty and territorial integrity"".

Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has revealed that the labour shortage is likely to remain even after Singapore opens its borders on 1 April 2022.
In his 2022 National Day Rally speech, the prime minister said that the local labour market will not immediately be able to absorb the large number of workers returning from overseas.
PM Lee pointed out that the labour market will likely remain tight even after Singapore reopens its borders next year.
“The Singapore economy is also undergoing major changes. Our traditional industries, such as manufacturing and construction, will be shrinking. The jobs of those in these industries will change. Jobs in the future will include data and cybersecurity, medical and health care, and the new sectors of digitalisation, artificial intelligence and advanced manufacturing.”

In 1945, Sidney Nolan (1917-1992) began his series of paintings of the bushranger, Ned Kelly (1854-1880) in the style of the American Regionalist artists who were painting scenes of rural life in the United States. In the late 1940s he turned his attention to the Australian landscape, painting it in his own distinctive way. The exhibition will explore how this new direction informed his subsequent painting of the Australian landscape, particularly his use of colour and light.
Sidney Nolan's painting, ‘Red Gum Forest', is one of his most well-known works. It is a large painting, which has been described as a 'portrait' of the Australian bush. Nolan's 'portrait' of the bush is not an objective depiction of nature, but rather an abstracted landscape that reveals his perception of the bush.

When the vaccination rollout started in February, it was clear Australia would struggle to reach the target of 80 per cent of the adult population fully vaccinated by the end of the year. With so much of the country still in lockdown, it was hard to reach those people most at risk, like people with disability, or people with a pre-existing medical condition, or those in the lowest socioeconomic groups, who are more likely to be hospitalised if they catch COVID-19. But by the end of August, the vaccination rate had passed 60 per cent, the highest rate of any country in the world. That rate is now expected to continue to rise as lockdowns ease, with states moving towards their own vaccination targets. It is also clear, however, that many people are waiting until the last minute, and the next few months will be crucial to making sure as many people as possible get vaccinated before the flu season hits.",2021,Technology,-587333952.0

Last week the Government rezoned land at western Sydney Airport to allow for a major development. The zone is known as the Metropolitan Airspace Precinct. This area is not near the airport. In fact the airport is on the opposite side of the M4 motorway. 
While the airport was being built, land values were significantly higher than the area in which the airport is located. But land to the west of the M4 has been rezoned to allow for the construction of a major housing development. This rezoning means that land prices are now at similar levels to land which is not near the airport. So land values to the west of the M4 are likely to fall significantly.
To take advantage of the higher values when land prices were high, the owners of land on the western side of the M4 may have been forced to build on their land, otherwise they could lose value if the land is rezoned for housing.

On 14 February 2021, the Federal Court released two asylum seekers detained in the Manus Island Regional Processing Centre who had been subject to a medevac transfer to Australia.
The Federal Court ordered the Commonwealth to transfer the two men to Australia as they were at risk of serious harm if returned to PNG, and to release them from detention.
This followed a successful application made by the Refugee and Immigration Legal Centre and Amnesty International to have the men released from detention, and a separate application by the men to the Federal Court challenging their removal to PNG.

Russia’s top court on Thursday upheld the sentence of journalist Yelena Milashina for discrediting the state, a charge that can be used to jail those who criticize the Kremlin or report on corruption, according to rights groups.
The decision was widely seen as a sign of growing intolerance for dissent and a setback for media freedom in Russia, which is already ranked the world’s worst country for such freedoms by press freedom groups.
The ruling against Milashina, a reporter for the Novaya Gazeta newspaper, came at the end of a hearing on Thursday by Russia’s Supreme Court.
The court had convicted Milashina last November of discrediting the state over a story she wrote in 2017 in Novaya Gazeta about a scheme to sell oil at an artificially low price that had cost Russia billions of dollars.

Octopuses can survive for nine days without oxygen thanks to a chemical reaction in their blood, according to a new study. In the study, published in the journal Communications Biology, scientists observed an octopus surviving 10 days without oxygen, while others found that the creatures survive for nine days without oxygen in a closed environment. In fact, the researchers were able to keep the octopus alive for nine days without oxygen.
Octopuses are known for their unusual physiology, with their complex nervous systems, eight arms, and three hearts, but now scientists are learning more about how they use their bodies to survive. The latest study, published in the journal Communications Biology, looked at the chemical reaction that occurs in the blood of octopuses when they are deprived of oxygen. The researchers found that the octopus's blood is able to convert oxygen to hydrogen peroxide, which is then used to produce energy.

Researchers working at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) said they had discovered fossilised traces of a bacterium living inside an ancient Martian meteorite. It was a remarkable find that could explain how life first emerged on Earth billions of years ago. The discovery was announced last month at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in Washington, DC.
Scientists believe that if there was microbial life on Mars at any point in its history, it would have been the only place in the solar system capable of sustaining it.

This week, we have another piece of interesting news from the South African sporting landscape. The Cricket South Africa (CSA) has been under the microscope of late, as the country’s cricket administration has been accused of fostering a culture of racism.
Earlier in the year, it was revealed that South African cricket player Quinton de Kock had refused to take the knee to protest against racism during an international match. The decision not to take a knee was also seen as a sign of protest against a lack of black representation in the leadership of CSA.
De Kock’s actions were met with criticism from many in the South African sporting world, and in the wider South African community. But it is important to remember that it was his right as a South African citizen to make the choice he did.

This is great for crops that require a lot of moisture or are grown in low fertility situations.
You could also mix straw bales into the soil, adding carbon content and nutrients to the paddock to improve soil health.
Secondly is something called soil moisture bags. These are black plastic bags that sit on the surface of the paddock, holding in water and reducing evaporation.

White House fears significant hack, Microsoft Exchange email servers
The White House on Monday said it was ""aware of reports about a significant hack"" of email servers at Microsoft, and was in touch with the company.
""Reports of this activity have been coming in over the past few days and we are aware of them,"" White House spokeswoman Emily Horne said in a statement.
""Microsoft is aware of the issue and is investigating,"" she added.
Microsoft did not immediately respond to a request for comment. It had already acknowledged on Saturday that ""an initial security incident"" had been detected.
The Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday that the US had detected the hack and had started an investigation into it.
""The US is aware of reports of a cyberattack that targeted US government organizations,"" the White House statement said.

Waiting rooms are where you go if you have a problem. You want to be seen and have your problem resolved.
So what are they saying? Here is some of what I hear.
It’s the government’s fault because they’re not spending enough. I’m talking about the government that has been running the country since March last year. The government that has been the only one running the economy since the country went into lockdown and was told to shut down. The government that has been in charge of our lives and the lives of our children, who are in lockdown for a second time. The government that has been running a deficit in our economy. The government that has been spending more on wages for essential services (that have been working 24/7) than on wages for essential services (that have been sitting around doing nothing for months). The government that is borrowing more than it ever has. The government that has a debt-to-GDP ratio of ",2021,Technology,-574080832.0
"08 June 2021 - activist seek military training from ethnic rebels
As the fighting between the military and the Arakan Army escalates, the conflict has also reached some ethnic armed groups that operate in Rakhine State. On May 18, the Arakan Liberation Party (ALP) and the Arakan Army (AA) were involved in a clash in Buthidaung Township. The ALP announced that the clashes were caused by the AA’s attempt to control Buthidaung’s northern region.
On May 24, a 15-member group of the AA and the Shan State Army – South (SSA-S) launched a military training program in Mrauk-U Township. The AA is the main military group fighting against the Tatmadaw (Myanmar military). The program was organised by the ALP and the United Nationalities Federal Council (UNFC), a coalition of ethnic armed groups. There is concern that ethnic armed groups in the UNFC might be involved in fighting against the Tatmadaw.

"09 January 2021 - st kilda protest against tigray ethopia alleged genocide
The Victorian Council of Churches (VCC) expresses deep concern and sadness at reports of the current situation in Ethiopia. The reports of massive killings and forced deportations of people from Tigray region by Ethiopian and Amhara regional forces raise disturbing questions about what may amount to a genocide and are in clear violation of international law.
It is deeply concerning that this is occurring in one of the most strategically and economically significant African countries, with the potential to cause great harm to peace, stability, and development on the continent. The VCC therefore urges the Australian Government to work urgently with the international community to bring about a rapid and effective cessation of violence and respect for human rights.
This is not the first time we have seen ethnic conflict in Africa. It is time for international communities, including Australia, to work with all relevant parties to seek a just peace, rather than a situation where any conflict is seen as a zero-sum game, and where any resolution is likely to be seen as being at the",2021,Technology,-608510720.0

Trump has since left the White House.

In the movie industry, the saying goes that “you don’t know who the next big thing is, until you see it”.

Egypt says it hopes to salvage a massive container ship that blocked the Suez Canal and caused billions of dollars in lost trade for weeks, but it has yet to determine whether the vessel can be freed and what it will take to free it.
Officials have been working to free the ship for weeks, and have not yet given a date when they expect to get the Ever Given back to traffic. The 400-meter-long (1,300-foot-long) vessel is stuck diagonally across the canal, which connects the Mediterranean to the Red Sea.
While the canal can still handle some ships, the loss of a major artery for global trade has hurt the economy of Egypt, the country where the Suez Canal Authority operates the canal. The canal has long been a lifeline for global trade, and the country that controls it has long enjoyed the economic benefits.

"12 November 2021 - the peaks trail
Today I got up at 6:15am and left the campsite to make my way to the summit of the mountains near the town of Potosi, Bolivia. The summit of Potosi is known as the highest mountain in South America at 6972m. I had decided the day before to take the peaks trail rather than the regular trail, which was an 11km hike to the summit of Potosi. The regular trail was too dangerous with all the traffic on the road to the summit and I felt the peaks trail was safer for a solo hiker. The peaks trail was 20km and took about 5.5 hours to complete. It was quite steep in places and I was a little scared of the sheer drop on some sections, especially the final descent down to the road below.
The trail was spectacular with views of the mountains all around. There were many other people out on the trail, some with horses and a few on mountain bikes. The",2021,Technology,-569578880.0

"30 November 2021 - why some airbnb hosts refuse refunds during covid
The pandemic has been very hard on the tourism sector in many countries. It's been so bad that governments have had to step in with grants to keep the sector going. Many have closed down completely in many locations, while others have been forced to lay off employees and cut hours.
It's hard for hosts to get by with no income. The average cost of an Airbnb host is over $10,000 a year and there's no guarantee of revenue, so it's understandable that some hosts are hesitant to give refunds during covid.
