china finance official executed in bribery case,30 January 2021,"30 January 2021 - china finance official executed in bribery case, state media says
A former senior Chinese financial regulator has been executed after being convicted of bribery in a case involving his close family ties with top officials, state media said Monday.
Li Dongsheng, who once headed China’s banking and insurance regulators and served as head of the powerful Central Leading Group on Financial and Economic Affairs, was executed last week, the Global Times newspaper reported, citing a statement from the official Xinhua News Agency.
Li, 72, was convicted in December of bribery and other crimes, including taking “huge bribes” from a state-owned insurance firm, the Global Times said.

Australian Man Arrested Allegedly Running Dark Net Marketplace
The Dark Web is a hidden network of sites accessible only by the Tor browser. The site’s name is derived from the dark net because the network is often used for illegal activities. There is a plethora of illegal drugs and other illicit goods available on the Dark Web, as well as a number of sites that sell these goods. The site’s administrators have been arrested, and an Australian man has been charged with running the site. This is the first time an Australian has been charged with running a Dark Web marketplace.
What is a dark net marketplace?
Dark net marketplaces are websites that operate on the dark web and offer a wide range of products and services. They typically use the Tor network, which is a network of onion sites that are encrypted and cannot be accessed by normal web browsers.

China is home to around 19 percent of the world’s population and, as we have just heard, has become the world’s largest importer of minerals in recent years. That means China is heavily reliant on the mineral supply chain, which can be seen in the graph above.

China’s economy has been growing steadily since the turn of the century, but recent economic data suggests that the country is slowing down. This could have serious consequences for China’s trade and its relationship with other countries.
The slowdown in China’s economy is not only due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but also to structural problems in the economy. For example, China’s economy is heavily dependent on exports, which means that if there is a downturn in the global economy, China will suffer as well.

While the Government is set to approve visas for around 25,000 skilled workers in the first half of 2022, that’s only a fraction of the skilled workers needed in the UK. The problem is that a lack of skilled workers has led to 1.3 million job vacancies across the UK, and many employers can’t find people to fill them.

In a bid to tackle a growing homelessness crisis, the state government has called for applications from charities and other not-for-profit groups to house rough sleepers at a new facility in the Gold Coast.
It’s a move to house 60 rough sleepers as the government tries to alleviate a surge in rough sleeping cases.
The 25-bed emergency accommodation will be opened for three months.
However, with no vacancies on offer and the state government facing its worst housing affordability crisis on record, a local landlord is urging the government to allow the market to help solve the problem.
“I think the government should focus more on letting the market solve the issue rather than getting caught up in the bureaucracy and not knowing where to start,” says Craig Bickerton, a long-term Gold Coast landlord who’s currently looking to buy a 20-unit apartment complex in Surfers Paradise.
He says while there’s a shortage of accommodation on the Gold Coast, the housing stock is there for those willing to work with investors.

Natural gas has long been considered the fuel of the future in many parts of the world, and in recent years the focus has shifted to the UK. Natural gas has been dubbed “the clean fuel” and with growing concerns over climate change it is becoming increasingly clear that we must reduce our carbon footprint.
We have previously explored the growing role of hydrogen in the energy market, and how the industry is working towards a more sustainable future. However, another important element to the future of the energy market is natural gas.
Natural gas is one of the world’s most abundant and versatile sources of energy, making it an important component of the global energy mix. It is considered a “transition fuel” as it can be used to replace dirty fuels such as coal and oil and reduce carbon emissions in the process. It is also a clean fuel, as it produces far fewer emissions when burned than other fossil fuels.

The New Zealand Government is considering how to use its $1.5 billion surplus this financial year as the economy recovers from COVID-19, says Finance Minister, the Hon Simon Birmingham. 
“We are now in a strong position as New Zealand’s economy is in a healthy state, with a solid recovery expected to continue over the coming years,” he said.
“Our forecast is for an annual growth rate of around 3.2% over the coming three years, which is expected to lead to a budget surplus of around $8 billion a year by the end of the decade.
“This will give the Government the flexibility to invest in our long-term economic future, and we are now considering how we can best use that financial space to do that.
“The first priority is to ensure New Zealanders can make the most of the current economic environment, by ensuring that Kiwis continue to have their own future, by having the confidence to invest in our communities and grow the businesses that create jobs, and to","

Qld's micro breweries, artisan liquor distillers to benefit from new laws
Small businesses in Queensland’s liquor and craft beer industries will now have easier access to funding and more opportunities for export under new laws announced by the Palaszczuk Government.
Queensland has the second-largest microbrewery sector in the nation and is one of the fastest-growing craft beer producing regions in the world.
The Palaszczuk Government has passed the Liquor and Other Amusement Machines Amendment Bill 2020, which amends the Liquor Act 1992 to remove the requirement for micro breweries and artisan liquor distillers to hold a special liquor licence.
The amendments will reduce the costs and red tape associated with operating these businesses and allow them to expand their operations.

A few weeks ago we released the April 2021 Australian Inflation Update report, which provides a quarterly update on developments in consumer prices and inflation expectations. Today we are releasing the accompanying Inflation Monitor, which includes new forecasts and an analysis of the outlook for inflation.
The main economic story is that the coronavirus pandemic continues to constrain demand for goods and services and, as a result, inflation remains well below our target range. Our baseline forecast is for inflation to be around 1.5 per cent over the coming year, with the underlying measure of inflation in the first half of this year around 0.75 per cent. This is the weakest reading since the pandemic began. However, the low level of inflation is likely to be transitory, reflecting the ongoing constraints on economic activity.

A recent study from the Office of National Statistics shows that the average house price in the UK is now £249,000. This is a huge increase from £131,000 back in 2001. This huge increase has led to some buyers taking risks with properties.
This is causing some experts to warn buyers to be careful, as there is still a lot of risk out there. They are also worried that the government's stamp duty holiday may have caused some buyers to make risky decisions.
There is also some concern that the risk is more common with people who may not have considered the risks before.

Back in 2018, before the pandemic, the average house price in the UK was £219,000. The average house price in the UK in 2010 was £144,000. This means that prices have increased by 74% in the last 10 years.

markets: market activity and analysis with matt,27 June 2021,"27 June 2021 - markets: market activity and analysis with matt hughes
In today’s video, Matt Hughes is joined by Paul Mason to talk about what’s going on with the markets this morning and why it matters.
The Dow Jones has opened down around 800 points and we’re still waiting for the US open. The reason for the dip in stocks is because the bond market has been selling off bonds, which has driven down the price of long-term US treasuries and caused yields to rise.
This is because as the bond prices fall, bond yields rise. We’re also seeing a drop in the price of copper, which is something that tends to happen when people are less optimistic about the economic recovery.
The dollar has rallied in reaction to the move in the stock market. The move in the dollar comes at a time when the dollar index is close to a two-year high and the US dollar has benefited from the flight to safety in the market over the last couple of months.
