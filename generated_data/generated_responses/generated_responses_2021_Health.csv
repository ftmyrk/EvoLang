coronavirus sweden banning masks,10 February 2021,"10 February 2021 - coronavirus sweden banning masks
The Swedish government has announced that people are no longer required to wear face masks in indoor public spaces, including on public transport.
The announcement, made by Prime Minister Stefan Lofven on 9 February 2021, applies to Sweden, which has avoided strict lockdowns and social distancing rules. 
The move has been widely welcomed by Swedes, who have been forced to comply with mask rules for more than a year. However, the lifting of the face mask requirement is being seen as a gamble by some.
“It’s a risky decision,” says Fredrik Björling, professor of public health at Umeå University.
“We’re still in the middle of a pandemic, and the risk of becoming infected is still high. It’s not the time to take away all the restrictions,” he adds.

The government has extended the coronavirus emergency powers until 12 April, but it is unlikely to use them for a third national lockdown.
Prime minister Boris Johnson said in a Commons statement the move would give his government time to ""prepare a range of new measures"" to combat the virus.
The extension came into effect at 11pm GMT on Saturday.
However, the government will be able to reimpose lockdown restrictions without needing a parliamentary vote.
The prime minister said it was ""extremely important that the law continues to be in place"" to help the country tackle the virus.

Australia has been accused of withholding critical information and giving the wrong impression about its vaccine program.

This underreporting has occurred despite government officials admitting the truth.
On top of this, the government has also failed to inform the public of the real figures in their media releases.
There is some good news in all of this, though, because the federal government’s “underreporting” means that more people will be vaccinated sooner.
This, of course, means that Australia’s vaccine rollout will accelerate sooner than it otherwise would.

According to media reports, the Australian government has been underreporting its supply figures by 20 to 25 percent.
This underreporting has occurred despite government officials admitting the truth.
On top of this, the government has also failed to inform the public of the real figures in their media releases.
There is some good news in all of this, though, because the federal government’s “underreporting” means that more people will be vaccinated sooner.
This, of course, means that Australia’s vaccine rollout will accelerate sooner than it otherwise would.
The government has said that it’s the right thing to do because the government doesn’t want to give people the wrong impression that Australia is failing to vaccinate its people.

But the boss of Sydney Airport is telling travellers that the vaccine will have to be rolled out widely before we can start to ease up.
A lot of the passengers are very excited, they’re very happy to come in, and the people that have to isolate, the people who come from overseas, they’ve got to have the freedom to do that,” says the Sydney Airport boss.

What's in the air at the moment is the number of infections in various countries of the world. What is interesting is that we have heard more and more information about the fact that in some countries a lot of vaccinations have been given but still a large number of people, and even doctors, are infected with coronavirus. How is that possible?
There are many opinions on this, and no one really knows. The most probable answer seems to be the spread of a new, more dangerous and highly infectious mutation of the coronavirus. According to some estimates, this mutation may even spread faster. But we do not know that for sure.
But it is also possible that we are dealing with something more than just a new mutation. What is possible, according to the opinions of some scientists, is that some people, after vaccination, develop the virus again, which means that even if the body develops antibodies to the vaccine, it is possible that it does not protect us from infection.

But there are two questions that have vexed Australians for decades, and still trouble some of us today.
One, should the government force everyone to be vaccinated? And two, should the government provide everyone with the vaccine?
There's a third question, which is related to the first two: How should we respond to a pandemic that requires mandatory vaccination?
As a philosopher, these questions really interest me. But it also raises more practical questions: Which approach would we take if we found ourselves in this situation?
One approach would be to say that vaccination should be mandatory for those in the economy, like in the case of a flu vaccine. But what if we think that vaccination should be mandatory for all citizens?
There are also a range of intermediate options, including mandatory vaccination only for certain professions or activities, such as public transport and public schools. These would be necessary for the economic and social recovery of the country"," to sydney

State and territory leaders met on Wednesday to acknowledge the impacts of lockdowns across Australia and call for a national strategy to manage them.
Leaders expressed their concerns that the states and territories had been left without a national plan to manage lockdowns. The meeting agreed on three points:
There should be a national plan to manage COVID-19 outbreaks. This includes better information sharing and clear processes to be followed.
All states and territories should be supported with federal resources to manage the effects of lockdowns.
The federal government should support the development of a national vaccine plan. This includes vaccination of international students, workers and their families.

The Therapeutic Goods Administration has approved the AstraZeneca vaccine for use in Australia, in a bid to curb the number of coronavirus cases in the country.
The vaccine is the first that has been approved for use in Australia, although other countries including the United Kingdom have already used it. The approval comes after Prime Minister Scott Morrison last week said the country would not be procuring any other vaccines until after February.
The AstraZeneca vaccine is a viral vector vaccine. This means that the vaccine uses a weakened version of a common virus to trigger an immune response to help the body fight the COVID-19 virus.
Viral vector vaccines are typically used for more common viruses and have been used in influenza vaccines for years. This type of vaccine is considered to be easier to produce, less expensive, and can be stored at room temperature.
The AstraZeneca vaccine will be stored at temperatures of 2 to 8 degrees Celsius. It is the first vaccine that can be stored at this","

“I would say the incidence of the blood clots are so low that you can’t say for sure that they are linked to the vaccine,” he said.
But Cutler said that in some cases, people may not develop the symptoms immediately.

We know that the vaccine works as well in older adults as in younger adults. So, why do we need two doses? We know from the trials that one shot does not provide good protection in older adults and that protection is better after two doses. The FDA is looking into whether the second dose will be given 21 days or 28 days after the first shot. As there is no evidence that the second shot is harmful, the decision on the interval between shots has been left to the individual doctors, rather than having a standardised time between shots.

Fingerboards are made from wood and are used to control and navigate a model vehicle. They can be attached to most RC vehicles and have the same purpose as a conventional steering wheel.
Fingerboards are often used as a more natural way to control an RC vehicle because they can be easier to hold and do not require as much grip as a conventional steering wheel.
They also make it possible to hold the steering wheel in one hand and control the speed with the other, making it possible to have more control over the vehicle and avoid accidents.

This leaves just over 81% for upper middle-income countries and high-income countries, of which more than 70% will be used in 10 high-income countries. [1]

victoria coronavirus sites do contact tracing,08 January 2021,"08 January 2021 - victoria coronavirus sites do contact tracing apps work
Coronavirus Contact Tracing Apps
A new coronavirus contact tracing app is being developed in the UK. It is being called the ""Peppermint app"" and will be based on Google's ""Contact Tracing"" app.
How do these new contact tracing apps work?
They use Bluetooth to detect when two phones are near each other and exchange information.
This information is then stored in the phone's memory. If one person tests positive for the coronavirus and reports it to the government, the app sends out an alert to other users.
The alert asks people if they were in contact with the infected person and encourages them to self-isolate if they were.
The information is stored locally on the phone and not uploaded to any server, so it is completely anonymous.
This information is stored on the phone for 21 days and then deleted automatically. It is not kept permanently or uploaded to any server.
Does it work as well as the NHS app?
Some experts are sceptical about the effectiveness"," apps work

As of the 21st of December 2021, the majority of COVID-19 cases in Europe are caused by Omicron. However, we still do not know if this variant will cause more severe disease than Delta. The latest research has shown that Omicron is associated with a lower risk of hospitalisation and death in individuals with no prior history of SARS-CoV-2 infection, compared to individuals with Delta. There are several reasons for this, including the fact that Omicron has a higher number of mutations and that a number of the mutations in the spike protein that facilitate binding to the host cell have been lost. However, the mutations may also provide the virus with some other, yet unknown advantage. We can therefore expect to see a decrease in the number of severe cases caused by Omicron compared to Delta.

AUSTRALIA’S Chief Medical Officer Paul Kelly has called for vaccine nationalism to end as Australia races to get more vaccines into the arms of the population.
Speaking to the media on Sunday, Professor Kelly said that there needed to be a change in attitude among governments around the world, with many refusing to share their vaccine supply.
He said Australia was now in the phase where there was no need to hoard the supply for its own citizens.
“Vaccine nationalism, which is not a good idea, is coming to an end, and I don’t know how it came about,” he said.
“We’re in a position where the only way we can accelerate vaccination is by making vaccines available to everybody in the world.
“Now we have to look beyond Australia, and it would be very foolish for Australia not to look to get those vaccines from somewhere else, and there are vaccines that will be available and Australia will not be the only place they are available.”

He said Australia was now in the phase where there was no need to hoard the supply for its own citizens.
“Vaccine nationalism, which is not a good idea, is coming to an end, and I don’t know how it came about,” he said.
“We’re in a position where the only way we can accelerate vaccination is by making vaccines available to everybody in the world.
“Now we have to look beyond Australia, and it would be very foolish for Australia not to look to get those vaccines from somewhere else, and there are vaccines that will be available and Australia will not be the only place they are available.”

04 December 2021 - scientists race to test the effectiveness vaccines omicron variant
The World Health Organization (WHO) called the new variant “omicron” as a result of genetic studies. Scientists say it may be the most concerning version of the virus to date. It seems to be spreading quickly.
South Africa's president announced the new variant on Friday. It was first detected in Botswana and South Africa.
Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove, technical lead of the World Health Organization's emerging diseases and zoonosis unit, said on Saturday that scientists have “found preliminary evidence of increased transmissibility, increased escape from vaccines, more severe disease, and a higher risk of reinfection, but it's still early.
“This is a new variant, and the information we have right now suggests that this may be the most concerning variant we have seen to date, in terms of our transcripts, and so there are more questions than answers right now,” she said.

On January 31, 2021, The WHO published the results of the investigation into the origin of the Covid-19 pandemic. This investigation is the work of a team of experts led by Professor Peter Daszak, who presented the results of their work in Wuhan in March 2020.
In a report published on the World Health Organization website, the international health agency reveals that the Covid-19 pandemic arose from an intermediate animal host, most likely a bat or bat, and that this intermediate animal was most likely sold in a market in Wuhan.
This intermediate animal, which has not been identified, was then brought into close contact with other mammals, such as pangolins, which may have acted as a transmission relay.
China does not recognize the existence of this intermediary animal, but rather believes that the virus is linked to a wild animal, such as the masked palm civet, whose meat was sold in the Wuhan market.

But he also added that “the balance of the risks of not doing something versus doing something should be explained in terms of what the risk is and what the gain is”.

The news that a serious adverse event had occurred in the US in the hours before the rollout of the Pfizer vaccine was greeted with understandable shock. The UK has since reported several similar events.
A rapid review has been carried out, including by experts at the UK Health Security Agency, the Royal College of Physicians and the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, which found no evidence of a causal link between vaccination and the adverse events. The review concluded that the events, which occurred very shortly after vaccination and had all resolved, were likely coincidental, not related to the vaccine.

The report, conducted by the Melbourne School of Population and Global Health in collaboration with The Australia Institute and the Victorian Council of Social Service, examined the distribution of the COVID-19 vaccine rollout, and identified potential areas of concern.
The University of Melbourne’s report, titled The Victorian Vaccine Rollout and Equity: A Case Study for Australia, found that some people who had been vaccinated were not counted as such because of a ‘duplicative’ process of entering their details into two different databases, and that the lack of access to internet and technology had made it harder for some people to access the vaccine.
The report also found that there was a “lack of coordination” between the Victorian Government and Federal Government’s efforts to expand the vaccine rollout to more people.

With all the talk about the new vaccine for covid19 and its roll out in Australia, it's a good time to ask a few questions. Why do we need to vaccinate? Why don't we just do what other countries are doing and let it burn itself out. How many people will die from the vaccine? How many people will die from not having the vaccine? Will there be enough vaccine? Will the vaccine be free?
The Australian Department of Health has published this page on how they plan to roll out the vaccination. It outlines their plan for 3 phases of vaccinations and that they are aiming to vaccinate 4 million people in the first 3 months.
They have also estimated that 60% of the population need to be vaccinated to reach herd immunity. Herd immunity is defined as the point at which the number of people who are vaccinated is high enough that the remaining unvaccinated people are protected by the herd immunity of the vaccinated people.

Tracing Australia’s COVID-19 Vaccine Rollout: October 6th
The Australian Government has begun to release vaccination data by state and territory, and we are following up on what the data tells us.
Australia has begun to roll out vaccinations. At the time of writing, nearly 5% of the population have received at least one vaccine dose, and nearly 2% of the population have been fully vaccinated.

Scott Morrison’s Apology About the COVID-19 Vaccine Roll-Out
Prime Minister Scott Morrison apologised to Australians on Friday for the ‘hiccups’ and delays in the vaccine rollout.
“We’ve had some hiccups, some delays, but it is going very, very well and there are lots of Australians now receiving their vaccine in their local community, and there’s more to come,” Morrison said.
Morrison apologised for not making enough Pfizer vaccines available in Australia until April 2021.
“I apologise to every single person in this country, to the families that I have met, to every person who has been waiting for their vaccine, to all those who are waiting to get their vaccine. I apologise for the hiccups. I apologise for the delays, because they were not as rapid as we would have liked them to be. But I can assure you it will be made up for, and it is,” the Prime Minister said.

south africa will suspend use of the astrazeneca vaccine,08 February 2021,"08 February 2021 - south africa will suspend use of the astrazeneca vaccine from wednesday over concerns about its effectiveness - health minister
South Africa will suspend use of the AstraZeneca vaccine from Wednesday over concerns about its effectiveness, health minister Zweli Mkhize said on Tuesday, after a study showed the jab offered minimal protection against mild and moderate coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the country.
The decision, made after consulting with other countries that use the vaccine, is ""in the interest of public safety and a matter of national priority,"" he said in a statement.

The list of eligible sectors includes meat processing plants, abattoirs, slaughterhouses and butcheries, and also includes slaughterhouses that produce pigs, cattle, sheep and goats, and their meat products.
EU Commissioner for Health and Food Safety Stella Kyriakides has confirmed that the meat processing sector will be included on the vaccine rollout list.
This was a key request from meat companies across Europe. The European Meat Processors Association (Europa Meat) and the Federation of European Meat Industry (FEMI) have pushed for this for some time. 
The meat processing sector is a high-risk sector and the need for vaccination has been underlined in recent weeks.

Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said the three-day lockdown was necessary because there was no way to determine the number of people who had caught COVID-19.

Agricultural workers are not part of the national vaccination programme, but the Farming Union has said that farmers need more clarity on who will be able to administer a Covid vaccine on farms.

In the wake of the devastating COVID-19 pandemic, the world is looking for a cure. One of the most promising candidates is the AstraZeneca vaccine, which has shown promising results in early trials. But how does the AstraZeneca vaccine work?
The AstraZeneca vaccine is a new type of vaccine that uses a modified version of a virus called Adenovirus to deliver the vaccine. This virus has been modified so that it can't replicate itself in the body. Instead, it delivers the genetic material for the coronavirus spike protein, which is responsible for causing COVID-19.
Once the genetic material for the coronavirus spike protein is delivered, the body's immune system recognizes it as a foreign invader and begins to produce antibodies and other immune cells to fight it off. These immune cells then remember the coronavirus spike protein and can quickly mount a defense against it in the future.

can vaccines prevent transmission of covid 19,05 March 2021,"05 March 2021 - can vaccines prevent transmission of covid 19
Vaccines and Transmission of Covid-19
We all know that covid 19 vaccines are currently in the news and the government and health authorities are encouraging people to take them. We also know that the covid 19 vaccine does not give people 100% immunity. So it begs the question – can vaccines prevent transmission of covid 19?
The answer is, it is possible to be infected by covid 19 after vaccination. However, it is less likely that a person who has been vaccinated will be able to infect another person.
How vaccines work – what are the different types of vaccine?
Vaccines work by making the body produce an immune response. This means that the immune system is ready and able to respond quickly to the virus. Vaccines contain a harmless version of the virus that causes the illness. This is called a “virus-like particle”. When the body produces an immune response to this, it has already been exposed to the virus and can now fight it off quickly and","

New evidence suggests the Covid-19 pandemic may have started in a bat and not as many thought from an intermediate host - a fruit bat or pangolin.
Researchers at the Chinese Academy of Sciences found the virus responsible for Covid-19 could have been circulating in bats in Wuhan long before the start of the pandemic.
The team says this is the first direct genetic evidence of the virus circulating in bats.
The virus was first identified in humans in Wuhan, China, and has since spread around the world.
But the study, published in the journal Virology Journal, says the virus was most likely circulating in bats for at least two years before the start of the pandemic.

The capitol riots were a coordinated operation by foreign actors and the US political leadership. There was an order given by the president to storm the capitol. Trump has called for the death of his political opponents.
These people are dangerous and the current president and members of congress must be investigated and held accountable.

Inequality is the key issue around COVID-19 vaccines
Who will have the vaccines first? Should everyone get one regardless of risk? How many doses should be administered?
These questions are the most prominent, but they’re just symptoms of a far bigger problem: inequality in the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines.
We need to focus not just on how to vaccinate as many people as possible, but how to do it fairly. This is because vaccine distribution is not just a public health challenge: it’s also an issue of ethics, justice, and social cohesion. All of these aspects of COVID-19 are already strained by the pandemic, and vaccine inequity will only make things worse.
The inequalities in vaccine distribution are already visible. For example, while the US has vaccinated more than 3 million people, India, a nation of more than 1.3 billion people, has vaccinated just over 3 million. This is partly because India is a developing nation with low vaccination coverage.","

According to a report published by the Financial Times on March 3, 2021, Italy has suspended shipments of the Covid-19 vaccine to the EU, as the country continues to battle a growing pandemic wave.
Italy’s health ministry has ordered an immediate halt to the delivery of Covid-19 vaccines to the EU, a move that has left some member states scrambling to arrange for supplies from other countries, according to people familiar with the matter.
The move highlights the difficulty the bloc faces in getting its hands on vaccines in the middle of a crisis that is rapidly deteriorating in many countries.
EU countries have been under pressure to share vaccines as cases surge, particularly in central and eastern Europe, which have been hard hit by the new variant of the virus.
But Italy, the EU’s fourth largest economy, has been reluctant to share its vaccine supply with other countries.

The coronavirus B1351 variant first identified in South Africa has a large mutation in its spike protein, which means it has an improved ability to invade human cells, scientists in Israel have reported.
A study led by Dr. Tal Patalion at Tel Aviv University, found that B1351 was able to invade cells more efficiently than a related B.1.351 virus, with an 80% to 200% higher rate of entry into human cells.
The mutation is an insertion of two amino acids into the spike protein of the coronavirus, at positions 67 and 69.
Patalion and her colleagues in the study, published in the journal  Nature, compared B1351 to two other South African variants, B.1.351 and B.1.1.248.

As a result of this data, Tas Rehab Services (TRS) had to increase their intake capacity to 100% and were working to manage 600+ clients through their drug and alcohol programs. These are not figures that will diminish anytime soon. With many Tasmanians struggling with addiction due to the lockdown, there are many people that will require the support of Tas Rehab Services in the near future.
Tas Rehab Services has 18 years of experience working with drug and alcohol clients. They are a multi-faceted service, that offer a variety of drug and alcohol programs to those who need it. TRS also offers a comprehensive outpatient program, as",Health

For example, 1,000,000 cases in the U.S. would be 3,000,000 in Japan. And 10,000 deaths in the U.S. would be 50,000 in Japan.
That means that deaths in Japan are 3 times lower than they are in the U.S. for each thousand cases. But the difference is even larger than that. The reason is that the death rates in the U.S. are much higher for people of a certain age group. The death rate for the oldest age group is 25 times higher than the death rate for people under 60. So, the number of people dying of Covid-19 in the U.S. is very high in the older age groups.

That's a big drop compared to the rest of the population, who are now at 53 per cent and 33 per cent, respectively.

The principal of the Canberra College of Public Safety, Brian McArthur, says he is unlikely to vaccinate his 30 staff because they don’t interact with the community. “I don’t see what the problem is, quite honestly.

The rollout of the Covid-19 vaccine will begin next Monday, with 200,000 doses arriving in Ireland.

Now, as we head into our fifth lockdown with no end in sight, we’re starting to see the fallout.
But not in the way you might expect. 
The first month of lockdowns brought a huge rush of people selling and moving house in an effort to be closer to loved ones.
But as restrictions began to ease, many of those people are now regretting their moves and seeking to relocate again.

The report, ‘Religious exemptions and conscientious objection to the current coronavirus legislation’, provides a comprehensive review of the exemptions that currently exist in England, and concludes that the law as it currently stands provides no legal basis for either religious or conscientious objection to the current restrictions.
It makes the case for the introduction of a new legal basis for religious exemption, but only on the basis of the new law replacing the current Coronavirus Act 2020.

It’s no secret the pandemic has been tough on artists. And, like many, the duo of Wa folk punks Screw Acoustics have found it hard to keep going.
For starters, the show they were set to play at The Crown and Anchor on January 9 was cancelled due to Covid.
The gig was to be the launch of their debut album, Love, Hate, Drugs & Farts. The band was also supposed to be supported by The Hugs and The Big Wreck, but both bands also had shows cancelled.
They were also due to do a show at the same venue in January 2021 with The Dead Beats and The Hugs. The band was hoping to play a show in the Waikato in February and tour the country as soon as possible.
Lead singer and guitarist Simon O’Malley has been keeping busy, releasing a single on 6 December called The Best Day of My Life.

Children are different and what might work for one might not for another, so here are some tips that might help.
Be aware of how you are feeling
It can be easy to put your own needs to the side in order to focus on those of your child. But you will be able to provide better support if you take care of yourself. That means listening to what you are feeling and acting on that. It may be that you need to talk to your friends, family or a professional to support you and to help you feel better.

If you’re feeling unsure about what these changes mean for you, here’s everything you need to know about the latest restrictions. 
What does lockdown look like?
At 8pm tonight, everyone in NSW will need to stay at home except for essential reasons. 
This includes going to work, caring for children, exercising outdoors (with one person), getting medical care or going to school or daycare.
The state’s Chief Health Officer Dr Kerry Chant said people could also leave their homes for the purpose of travel if that travel was essential, and if they could not work from home.
Anyone who does leave their home is required to carry a permit with them, unless they live in an exempt area.

This pressure is impacting the availability of beds in the emergency departments and is resulting in people being transferred to other hospitals to make space.

The latest report, published by the Centre for Aboriginal Economic Policy Research (CAEPR) and the Cooperative Research Centre for Low Carbon Living (Low Carbon Living) today, shows that while remote Indigenous communities have seen a sharp reduction in overcrowding since 2016, access to a shower remains low and remains below the Government’s target.

At the beginning of the nineteenth century, Thomas Embling Hospital, the oldest institution of its kind in North America, was a small brick building at the corner of what was then called Union Street and the Dock.
In the late eighteenth century, the hospital had moved to an old stone house on the east side of King Street, south of Dock Street. It became known as Embling's Hospital. The hospital was a haven for men, women and children of indigent age who were suffering from any form of acute or chronic disease.
In 1848, Embling's Hospital was closed and a new building on the same site was erected by the Board of Guardians of the Union Workhouse and the General Union Workhouse at the corner of King and Union Streets. The hospital was intended to be a place of rest for the poor who were unable to obtain employment and the infirm who had no relatives or friends to care for them.

At the beginning of the nineteenth century, Thomas Embling Hospital, the oldest institution of its kind in North America, was a small brick building at the corner of what was then called Union Street and the Dock.
In the late eighteenth century, the hospital had moved to an old stone house on the east side of King Street, south of Dock Street. It became known as Embling's Hospital. The hospital was a haven for men, women and children of indigent age who were suffering from any form of acute or chronic disease.
In 1848, Embling's Hospital was closed and a new building on the same site was erected by the Board of Guardians of the Union Workhouse and the General Union Workhouse at the corner of King and Union Streets. The hospital was intended to be a place of rest for the poor who were unable to obtain employment and the infirm who had no relatives or friends to care for them. The hospital also provided care for the insane.

The Federal Government has been accused of misleading the nation on when it would be able to start giving out coronavirus vaccine. Prime Minister Scott Morrison is expected to deliver a national address tonight to reassure Australians that vaccine will be available in a matter of weeks.
Speaking to Sky News, Mr Morrison said that the first doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine will not be available until “mid to late March”.
He said the reason for the delay was the need to find 30,000 Australians who will be eligible to get the vaccine first.
The Prime Minister said this was not only due to the difficulty of finding Australians who had received two doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine overseas, but also those who had received one dose.

The state has been locked down since mid-May, in an effort to contain a COVID-19 outbreak, and has already lost $800 million in tourism revenue this year.
Australian Tourism Forum (ATO) Executive Director and CEO Andrew McEvoy said, “the NSW government has not engaged with the tourism sector on the impact of extended lockdowns and is not doing enough to support the sector as the NSW government and the national cabinet try to navigate an uncertain future.”
“This is a significant loss of revenue at a time when the sector was beginning to recover from the impacts of the pandemic.”
McEvoy said the NSW government is failing to meet its 2022 target of 10 million domestic visitors and $6.8 billion in visitor spending, due to the ongoing COVID-19 restrictions.

Joe Biden's Plan to Handle Covid Is Both Good and Bad News
In his first days as President, Joe Biden will be faced with the task of handling the coronavirus pandemic, a situation he’s been promising to fix since he started campaigning for the Democratic presidential nomination. His approach to the issue is not the same as that of President Donald Trump’s, which has included a refusal to call it a pandemic, a refusal to wear a mask, and an effort to downplay its severity.
President Biden is already announcing his first big moves to deal with the virus and the economy, and they’re a good sign for those worried about the health crisis, but not so much for the economy, which is already struggling.
According to The New York Times, Biden plans to set up a White House Office of the National Climate Advisor and a White House Office of the National Climate Action Center to coordinate climate change policy and work with the private sector to develop and implement solutions to climate change.

The vaccine developed by AstraZeneca is one of the more cost-effective options available to the British government. It can be manufactured in large quantities at relatively low cost. This means the country will be able to purchase enough vaccines for its entire population of over 66 million.
The AstraZeneca vaccine is designed to be given to individuals aged 18 years or older. The vaccine is a viral vector vaccine, meaning that it uses a modified common cold virus to carry the genetic instructions to produce a coronavirus spike protein. The coronavirus spike protein is what allows the virus to enter and infect human cells.
The vaccine is produced by a modified adenovirus that is used to carry the genetic instructions to produce the spike protein. This virus is then modified to be unable to replicate in humans.
When the vaccine is administered, the adenovirus and spike protein are introduced into the body. The body recognizes the adenovirus as a foreign invader and launches an immune response."," covid-19 vaccine vaccine

Unemployment is an inevitable part of life in the UK, but it has a particular impact on older people. While younger people have more time to find new roles, and the option to work on a zero-hours contract or with a temp agency, older people are more likely to face challenges in securing new jobs.
A lack of experience can mean that older people are less competitive than their younger counterparts, and they can find themselves shut out of the interview process. In the UK, age discrimination in the workplace is illegal, but despite the fact","

Meanwhile, the Morrison government is facing calls to stop using a coronavirus vaccine that has been linked to the deaths of hundreds of people around the world.

Pfizer has also released data that suggests the vaccine is 95% effective, meaning that the vaccine will prevent 95% of people who receive the vaccine from catching COVID. If you haven't heard of the 95% figure, it's because the data only includes people in the United States, and the results for the rest of the world are far less promising. A recent analysis of the data by the New York Times found that the vaccine was only 74% effective in preventing COVID in people in Britain, 80% effective in preventing it in South Africa, and 85% effective in preventing it in the US. All of these are significantly below the FDA's 95% figure.

17 February 2021 - new coronavirus variant found in the united kingdom
A new coronavirus variant called B.1.1.7 was identified by researchers in the United Kingdom. In laboratory tests, it appears to be more transmissible than previously identified strains of the virus. This means that it can spread more easily among people. This new variant is now spreading in the United Kingdom, Denmark, Australia, Italy, and the Netherlands. As a result, health officials in the United Kingdom, Denmark, and Australia have decided to shut down parts of their economies to stop the spread of the new variant. They are also planning to offer vaccinations to everyone who wants one. The new variant may be more transmissible than other variants because of some genetic changes in the spike protein on the virus' surface. The spike protein is the part of the virus that can latch onto the cells in our lungs and nose and make us sick. Researchers say that the new variant may be more likely to spread because the spike","

On 11 July 2021, the NSW Chief Health Officer (CHO) Dr Kerry Chant, recommended shortening the interval between the first and second dose of the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine from 12 to 8 weeks.
The change was based on updated vaccine safety data and new modelling data showing that with a shorter interval there is an even smaller increase in rare but serious blood clots.
In the meantime, people who had their first dose of AstraZeneca before 11 July 2021 should continue to receive their second dose of AstraZeneca on their originally scheduled date.
In addition, the recommendation applies to anyone aged 16 to 39 years who had their first dose of AstraZeneca more than 4 weeks ago.
This will allow a small number of people who were fully vaccinated in the 2- to 4-week window, to get their second dose and be fully vaccinated sooner.

""The announcement we made this morning is the beginning of a new travel bubble between Australia and New Zealand, which will be effective as soon as January 31, 2021,"" Morrison told reporters in Canberra.
""We will continue to work towards the goal of a fully open trans-Tasman travel bubble, with no need for travel restrictions, as we continue to reduce the risk of Covid in our community and the Australian and New Zealand people.""

A lot of people are in favour of a more liberal approach to managing the virus – the ‘herd immunity’ approach which is very much in vogue in the US. Lockdowns, it is argued, just don’t work – they can’t be enforced and are unfair on those who are still allowed to work. The alternative is a less draconian approach, but one which relies on more of us getting infected and getting through it. The problem is that most people don’t want to get sick – or die – and this approach is not likely to succeed.

The leader of a coalition of medical groups has warned that the Covid-19 vaccines being rolled out across the UK risk being too profitable for pharmaceutical companies.
The Royal Society of Medicine’s chief executive, Dr Andrew Goddard, said a lack of oversight from governments had allowed big business to dominate the rollout of the jabs.
The statement comes after the UK was dealt a blow last week when AstraZeneca paused its trials of its vaccine after a participant fell ill with a brain condition.
AstraZeneca has since resumed the trial in the UK and  said  the incident is “not considered to be related to the vaccine”.
Meanwhile, Pfizer’s vaccine was given the green light by the European Medicines Agency on Friday.
Goddard said the UK had been slow to take a stance on the ethical questions raised by the vaccine, and now had an opportunity to do so as the jabs roll out across the country.

The European Union has been criticised for its slow vaccine rollout and the failure to reach an agreement with Johnson and Johnson.
Meanwhile, a new study found that the vaccine from Johnson and Johnson provides very high protection against severe Covid-19, even if there are concerns over the number of side effects.
The European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said that the EU is facing a shortage of vaccines. This is due to a manufacturing problem with the Johnson and Johnson vaccine. The European Commission President added that the European Union and its member states need to agree on how the vaccine supply problems should be dealt with.
AstraZeneca had already reduced its delivery to the European Union by more than 20 million doses, and this is also affecting the rollout of the Covid-19 vaccine in the United Kingdom.

australias fertility rate continues to plummet amid pandemic,09 December 2021,"09 December 2021 - australias fertility rate continues to plummet amid pandemic, while births in china, india, russia soar
The fertility rate in Australia has fallen to an all-time low of 1.6 children per woman, the lowest since records began 140 years ago, with experts blaming the coronavirus pandemic for the drastic decline in births.
While many countries in Europe, the US and the Asia-Pacific region have reported a drop in births due to the pandemic, the figures in Australia are particularly stark. In 2001, the average number of children born to a woman was 2.4, and in 2011 it was 2.1, but it fell to 1.8 in 2019. The 2020 rate has not yet been recorded. The fertility rate, which has declined steadily over the past decade, is now lower than that of Germany, which recorded the lowest rate of 1.35 last year, and is lower than most developed nations, including the UK, Italy, France and New Zealand.

EU member states have been slow to administer first and second doses, and the commission is under pressure to boost their rollouts.

There is a clear and consistent difference in the approach of the new government to Victoria compared with NSW, and the difference seems to be that they have learned the lesson.
The lesson is this: there is nothing that governments can do to reduce transmission rates when the virus is present and it is inevitable that the virus will be present as it will be wherever there is a large number of people in confined spaces.
The difference is the approach to lockdowns. NSW and Victoria had different lockdowns but they were both the same: everyone was locked up and then everyone was let out.
The difference in approach between the new government and the previous government is that they had already made the discovery that lockdowns don’t stop the virus.
Lockdowns are a response to the virus, not the cause.

The National Vaccine Information Center (NVIC) is a non-profit, science-based organization founded in 1982 by parents who believed their children's injuries from vaccines were not adequately investigated and that they were not being warned of the possible risks of vaccines, even as their children became ill, were hospitalized, and even died.
Our mission is to protect the fundamental human right of informed consent to medicine and medical procedures and safeguard the rights and interests of the vulnerable, including children, women, pregnant and nursing women, people with disabilities and older adults.
We accomplish our mission by educating and empowering individuals to make voluntary, informed, independent and safe medical choices for themselves and their families without coercion or government mandates.

coronavirus found chickens infectious bronchitis virus vaccine,03 February 2021,"03 February 2021 - coronavirus found chickens infectious bronchitis virus vaccine
A vaccine for an important poultry disease that causes massive economic losses globally has been discovered by the research team led by Professor KITAPAT PANYIM, Dean, Faculty of Veterinary Science and Animal Technology, Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University.
The virus has been known as infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) that causes respiratory disease in chickens and turkeys with severe economic impacts. IBV infection is not only fatal to chickens but also causes high mortality in young chickens.
Currently, there are no vaccines available for IBV infection that are highly effective in reducing mortality. The most widely used vaccines are inactivated and live attenuated. However, the use of inactivated vaccines, especially in the young, results in vaccine failure due to their inability to stimulate humoral immune responses. On the other hand, the use of live attenuated vaccines can cause reversion of vaccine strains to virulent and pathogenic forms. Therefore, the research team has focused on developing novel vaccines to overcome","
