The left-wing, anti-austerity Syriza party won the Greek parliamentary election of 7 January, with a slim 3.4% majority. But its online election campaign strategy has come under fire for being too conservative.
The main opposition party, New Democracy, led by Kyriakos Mitsotakis, came in second with 32.3%. Syriza, led by Alexis Tsipras, won the election with 31.5% of the vote, while New Democracy got 31.5%. Syriza, which had been in power for four years, was the first political party in Greece to be given a majority in Parliament in the last 36 years.
But it was New Democracy that came up with the best online campaign, according to a new study.
""The New Democracy campaign used the platform to create a narrative of a country that was under attack,"" said Dr. George Georgiou, professor of political science at the University of Athens.

The Morrison government's latest climate change policy announcement is its Energy White Paper.

The White Paper was published in December 2020 but did not contain many new proposals, with the policy developments in the White Paper being extensions of earlier proposals, such as the National Energy Guarantee. The White Paper also reiterates the government's desire to reduce Australia's emissions through international carbon markets and the use of clean energy technologies.
In the White Paper, the government commits to continuing to subsidise the development of coal-fired power stations through the Australian Renewable Energy Agency. This follows the government's announcement in 2019 of a $1.5 billion investment in the Victoria-based Hazelwood plant which, despite being the oldest power station in Victoria, was not required to meet the state's renewable energy targets.

Donald Trump impeachment Senate trial: key takeaways from Day Four
Former US President Donald Trump is accused of inciting a mob that violently stormed the Capitol last week, as the second day of his impeachment trial kicked off.
What are Trump's arguments for acquittal?
Trump’s defence team argues that Trump didn’t incite an insurrection but instead urged people to protest against a result of the election they felt was unfair.
Trump lawyer Bruce Castor told the trial that Trump’s supporters felt that the November election was “stolen” by Democrats through a “massive fraud” and they “had to do something”.
“The president told them to peacefully protest the election results, and he did so repeatedly,” he said.
Castor argued that Trump’s words did not “rise to the level of an incitement”, but “a call to action to a peaceful protest.”

wa election win creates unusual problems for dominant wa labor,15 March 2021,"15 March 2021 - wa election win creates unusual problems for dominant wa labor party
Labor party leaders at federal and state level in Australia, who have run the country and state for many years, are now in a very weak position. This has implications for their relationship with Prime Minister Scott Morrison, the man who could now be the kingmaker for federal government.
Scott Morrison wins the WA election in very unusual circumstances. The Prime Minister had gone in and offered his support for Labor Party leader Mark McGowan, and that support was the difference between Labor winning and losing.
The problem is that Scott Morrison's own Liberal party won only 16 seats in the West Australian parliament, while Labor won 48 seats. That means that the Liberals have no ability to form a government, which means that Labor must find a partner to rule.
The fact is that this is the first time since the Whitlam government of the 1970s that Labor has been in a situation where it cannot govern. For many years, they have been able to rely on the smaller parties to form a coalition"," party

As the government finalises its response to the findings of the royal commission, it will be interesting to see how the government manages its response to recommendations.
The Royal Commission was called after a series of aged care facility scandals, including the My Aged Care fiasco, allegations of abuse in several aged care facilities, and the coronavirus outbreak in aged care facilities.
The commission was also criticised for its lack of independence, with many calling for a royal commission to be set up which had greater independence from the government.
The government’s response to the royal commission findings will be closely watched, with many hoping that the recommendations will lead to positive changes for the future of aged care in Australia.

majority of businesses want government to mandate vaccinations,11 August 2021,"11 August 2021 - majority of businesses want government to mandate vaccinations
The majority of businesses want government to mandate vaccinations for employees to help with the country's reopening plan, according to a new survey by Avison Young.  70% of Canadian businesses say they would mandate vaccinations for their employees, and 70% of workers surveyed said they would be comfortable with their employers doing so.
In order to safely reopen, it is vital that people are vaccinated, but the slow pace of vaccination means businesses are being asked to take on an even greater burden of risk. In an effort to minimize risk, businesses are implementing a range of measures including masking, physical distancing, and testing, and are expecting government to do its part to help minimize risk by mandating vaccinations. 
“The survey clearly illustrates that businesses and employees have a clear expectation that vaccinations will be mandated to help with reopening,” says John Walsh, President of Avison Young’s Canadian operations.  “This is a critical component of our country’s economic recovery, and this mandate is long overdue.”

The WA Health election promise that ‘ambulances should not wait at the hospital ramp more than 15 minutes’ is an admirable target that should be achieved, but is unlikely to be delivered on. The target is not achievable in an age where 4.6 ambulances wait at Perth hospitals and 5.7 wait in country hospitals, according to data released by Health Minister Roger Cook.

Victoria’s gambling regulators have accused the state’s government of being “in bed with” Crown Resorts, with a parliamentary inquiry finding that the casino operator has a “tremendous” amount of power over the government’s decision to grant it a casino licence.
The inquiry into Crown Melbourne’s licence application found that the operator had used its financial muscle to pressure the Victorian government into handing it the licence, in exchange for donations to political parties and other favours.
It also found that the company had used its financial power to pressure the government into handing it the licence, in exchange for donations to political parties and other favours.
The government has promised to review the licence after the inquiry, which is expected to report back next year.
The inquiry’s findings come amid growing pressure from gambling groups to introduce stricter regulations on casino licences.

The Victorian government also announced a $10 million fund to give small businesses “the extra financial support they need” to help weather the ongoing pandemic.
The relief package is for businesses who employ 20 or fewer people, with priority given to small retailers and hospitality.
Agricultural and food processing businesses will also be included, along with arts and cultural organisations, community groups and sports clubs.

The Victorian Animal Liberation Front is continuing its campaign to ban duck hunting in Victoria, with its most recent campaign calling on the State Government to amend the Game Animals Protection Act 1984 and ban the cruel hunting of waterfowl. In a new video released yesterday, the FLA has called for a permanent ban on duck hunting, and has shared an image of a duck’s skull, saying “This is what duck hunting looks like. This is why it must stop”.
The video comes after the FLA published a petition on Thursday, 14 January calling on Premier Daniel Andrews to “Ban the cruel and bloody practice of duck hunting”.
“Duck hunting is a brutal, inhumane, and illegal sport in Victoria. Duck hunters use snares, poison, nets, spears, guns and even fire to hunt waterfowl,” the petition reads.

But this hasn't stopped the former President from trying to subvert the results, which have already resulted in five Republican senators publicly calling for him to resign.
The reason that's so important in Georgia, of course, is that the state is key to both President Joe Biden's agenda and to Democratic control of the Senate.

On 8 December 2021, the Victorian Ombudsman released the findings of its audit into the Victorian Government’s handling of the Royal Commission into Aged Care Quality and Safety (the Royal Commission). The Victorian Ombudsman’s audit found that the Victorian Government had inadequate systems in place to ensure the implementation of recommendations in the report.
The Victorian Ombudsman concluded that there were “no mechanisms in place for government departments to monitor the implementation of Royal Commission recommendations”.
“The Victorian Government had no established systems or procedures for government departments to identify, track and monitor Royal Commission recommendations. This has led to a lack of transparency and accountability in relation to the implementation of Royal Commission recommendations, and in the Government’s ability to ensure that Royal Commission recommendations are properly implemented. There is also a lack of transparency about the Government’s overall approach to implementing Royal Commission recommendations,” the Victorian Ombudsman said in its audit.

q and a government tourism support package panned by operators,11 March 2021,"11 March 2021 - q and a government tourism support package panned by operators
Tourism operators have hit out at the government’s new support package, which they claim offers little assistance to those that have already gone bust due to the pandemic.
The $500m package has been designed to help support the travel and tourism sector through 2021 and 2022.
The package includes the continuation of the JobKeeper wage subsidy program and a new Tourism Relief Package which includes a 50 per cent subsidy of business rental costs, as well as support for workers in the travel industry.
It also provides $150m for grants to eligible businesses and organisations that have been directly affected by border closures and $10m in a business debt waiver program.
Tourism Accommodation Australia chief executive Mark Felton said he was disappointed by the package.
“We’re very disappointed the government didn’t provide more support in the package for businesses that are struggling to survive,” he said.
“Many of our members will still be closed for a large part of 2021, so this isn’t enough to support","

On Monday, 7 June, a spokesperson from the Department of Home Affairs told NITV that the Biloela family would not be resettled in Australia.
The Biloela family’s plight has been highlighted by many organisations across Australia and the world. The family were deported from Australia in 2018 under the former Turnbull government’s hardline border security policy. They had been granted humanitarian visas and were being looked after by family members while their visa applications were processed.
NITV spoke to Dr Hanny Al-Shaikhly, an Australian lecturer at the University of Melbourne, and the founder of No One Is Illegal (NOII) Victoria.
Dr Al-Shaikhly said the decision made by the Department of Home Affairs on Monday to reject the Biloela family’s visa applications was another blow to the family.

The Director of the Fisheries Commission, Samuel Asante, said the ministry has received complaints from fishing communities about the poor handling of fish that had been landed in Takoradi.
He said the fish are not being sold at the right price to them.
Mr. Asante also said some fish landed in Takoradi are being smuggled to Cote d’Ivoire and Liberia.

The scheme involved the purchase of the property by the offshore company for $A5.2 million. The offshore company had no assets and its sole directors were the parents of the then Treasurer of the Commonwealth of Australia, Scott Morrison, and his brother, Peter Morrison.
The offshore company then sold its interest in the property back to the Morrison family for $A5.1 million. No tax was paid on this transfer. The property is now worth $A9.4 million.

11 February 2021 - japanese government to ease restrictions as coronavirus cases decline
Japan’s central bank left its monetary policy unchanged and repeated its pledge to keep interest rates at rock-bottom levels for a long time. The Bank of Japan has been purchasing ¥80 trillion ($756 billion) of bonds every month, keeping interest rates ultra-low, to support the economy. At a news conference in Tokyo, the central bank left the target for its short-term lending rate at 0%, and the overnight call rate at -0.1%.
The Bank of Japan also decided to increase its monthly purchases of government bonds to ¥7 trillion ($65.6 billion) from the current ¥6 trillion ($55.8 billion). In an unusual move, the BOJ also said it would add new measures to help the government’s policy to reinvigorate the economy, while it aims to reach its 2% inflation target as soon as possible. The central bank will continue to conduct monetary easing, it said","

australian government urged to secure supplies,22 July 2021,"22 July 2021 - australian government urged to secure supplies of lithium, cobalt, copper, nickel and other key minerals
Australians have been asked to help the government find key mineral resources to secure a just transition away from fossil fuels.
In a submission to the government's inquiry into critical minerals, the Australian Mines and Metals Association (AMMA) called for a ""whole-of-government"" approach to securing resources.
The association called on the government to increase its ""critical minerals inventory"" and work with industry to ensure there is a stable supply of these minerals.
In a report last year, the Australian Strategic Policy Institute warned that a reliance on just one or two suppliers of these key minerals could leave Australia vulnerable to the whims of foreign governments.
The government has said it will release an update to the critical minerals inventory later this year.
AMMA chief executive Steve Knoll said the industry wanted the government to ""work with us to identify where the gaps are in terms of mineral exploration and production, and identify and secure the infrastructure needed to access these minerals"".

But Mr Morrison is expected to announce a net zero emissions target before the end of the year. And the government has back-flipped on a plan to axe the climate change commission.

why the rba and the government dont see eye to eye,15 March 2021,"15 March 2021 - why the rba and the government dont see eye to eye on interest rates
On 4 March, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) dropped its interest rate, the official cash rate, to a new all-time low of 0.10%. 
A low interest rate environment like this is a win for those who have been holding cash in savings accounts. It’s also a loss for those with outstanding debts and mortgages, because they have to pay more in interest and repayments. 
In this article, we’ll break down the details of what the RBA’s rate cut means and how it could impact you. 
The cash rate is a benchmark rate, set by the RBA, for the borrowing costs for other loans in the economy. It’s also the rate at which banks can borrow from the RBA. This is important because when the RBA cuts the cash rate, it usually lowers the rates of other loans. This means that interest rates for home loans, car loans, and business loans go down.

The Australian Government is deeply concerned about the situation in Papua New Guinea (PNG) as the number of COVID-19 cases increases dramatically. The PNG Government has taken the correct steps to address the situation, including the closure of its international border and imposition of domestic lockdown measures.
Australia is providing emergency assistance to the PNG Government to support its response, including medical equipment and personal protective equipment. Australia is also considering further measures to assist the PNG Government, subject to assessment of need and ongoing advice from the PNG Government.
PNG is one of the few countries in the region that has not been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.

WA Tourism Council slams Federal Government Tourism Package
The WA Tourism Council has slammed the Federal Government’s “completely inadequate” tourism stimulus package, saying it could set the state back 10 years.
In a joint statement with 23 other tourism peak bodies, the WATC said the $1.3 billion in funding to the industry was “simply not enough to make up for the losses incurred during the 2020 peak holiday period and will leave the industry at risk for at least another six months.”
“This package has been delivered with a completely inadequate focus on the tourism sector,” WATC CEO Evan Hall said.
“The Tourism Recovery Package is simply not enough to make up for the losses incurred during the 2020 peak holiday period and will leave the industry at risk for at least another six months.”
Tourism industry body Tourism Australia also condemned the Federal Government’s $1.3 billion stimulus package as “deeply disappointing” and a “clear missed opportunity.”

Republican-led Senate defies Donald Trump, overrides defence bill
A Republican-controlled Senate on Friday, 1 January 2021, voted to override Donald Trump's veto of the defense bill, making it the second veto to be rejected in the outgoing president's term, a move that further exposes the deepening fissures in the party's ranks, as it battles with the reality that Trump will soon be out of the White House.
Trump has increasingly been marginalized by many of his former supporters in the Republican party and as a result, the outgoing president's allies in the Senate are increasingly looking to distance themselves from his increasingly chaotic presidency and the looming threat of impeachment. Trump had vetoed the defense bill twice, calling it ""dangerous"" and ""defective"", because of the measure's lack of a ""no-fly zone"" provision that would give Trump authority to invade Venezuela, a country that he has repeatedly threatened to invade since 2017.

As of 1 July 2020, the Roads Corporation was established under the Roads Corporation Act 2018 to manage all public road infrastructure assets and operations for the Victorian State Government.
A number of changes were made to the Corporations Act to better reflect the structure and responsibilities of the Roads Corporation. The changes include:
expanding the powers of the Roads Corporation to be able to engage in transactions, borrow money and acquire, hold or dispose of property, and
removing a number of existing restrictions on the power of the Corporations Act to apply to the Roads Corporation.
The Victorian Government has also announced that it intends to establish a public company, Vicroads, which will be a wholly owned subsidiary of the Roads Corporation.
The Roads Corporation has been established to consolidate responsibility for the maintenance and management of the State’s road network in a single entity.

Ransomware attack on NSW Government IT systems
A ransomware attack on IT systems belonging to the NSW Government led to the suspension of government IT services on 6 January 2021. The attack did not result in any personal information being leaked to hackers. It is still unclear how many government IT systems were affected by the attack. There is a possibility that other government IT systems were affected.
Phishing attempts targeted people with NSW Government email addresses, however the attacks did not appear to originate from the government.
To minimise the risk of an attack like this, it is important to ensure all government employees are vigilant and do not click on links from unknown sources or reply to unsolicited emails. Employees are also reminded that it is important to regularly update anti-virus software.

President Joe Biden warned Russia that “there will be costs” if it interferes with the November 2022 elections, and he said Moscow is not capable of launching cyber attacks that the U.S. military cannot detect and defend against.
In an address to the nation, Biden said he has ordered a new strategy to counter Russia’s “ongoing, relentless attacks against us.”
Russia has been accused of trying to hack U.S. government agencies, the political apparatus and the media.
“Russian President Vladimir Putin has made it clear that he does not accept our election as a legitimate outcome,” Biden said. “He has made it clear that he does not believe that the United States is a true democracy.”

The Federal Government has dumped its plan to offer temporary superannuation to victims of family violence.
A draft government bill released on Friday shows that they have ditched their proposed scheme for victims of family violence.
The Greens had flagged their concern about the scheme when it was first announced in July last year and had asked the government to give victims the choice of either receiving compensation or additional super.
But the government has confirmed to the Greens that the proposed scheme is not going ahead.
This is very welcome news for victims of domestic violence and shows the Greens' intervention was needed.

It was the first step in a two-year process to reform the NDIS which would see the scheme move from an agency of the federal government to a statutory authority.
The NDIS is not the first or only area of policy that will be considered by the Morrison government’s second term.
But it is the most controversial, and there is already strong public opinion against its planned reforms.
This is why the government felt the need to hold off on publishing the discussion paper. The government could not afford to risk losing support for the NDIS itself.

The Deputy Premier made the comments following the publication of the Auditor-General’s report on Bushfire Recovery Funding. It was a report that did not accurately reflect the Government’s commitment to supporting communities affected by the unprecedented bushfires of 2019/20, Mr Barilaro said.
“The Auditor-General’s report makes many unfounded and incorrect claims. For example, the Auditor-General states we are not meeting our commitment to spend 100 per cent of the $1.8 billion announced in the 2020/21 State Budget.
“This is simply not true. The Government is committed to spending 100 per cent of the $1.8 billion allocated in the Budget. It’s a promise we will keep,” Mr Barilaro said.
“The Government has not been sitting on the money and it has not wasted money.

Australia's Northern Territory is taking action against seabed mining in the region, in response to concerns raised by traditional owners and local communities. The NT government has announced its ban on all seabed mining activities off the Top End of the Australian mainland.
The Northern Territory's environment minister, Eva Lawler, said, ""This is a big win for the traditional owners who raised their concerns about the environmental, cultural and economic impacts of this industry. It sends a message to industry that the NT government is not a blank cheque for offshore mining operations. This announcement signals to the industry that it needs to find a new site for this industry.""

Indigenous deaths in custody are the last of Australia's many unfinished businesses.

And they are also, by a wide margin, the most vulnerable to police contact, and the most vulnerable to police action. And, in 2021, we continue to have the most Indigenous deaths in custody in the world.
It was just over 50 years ago that Australia's first Prime Minister, Harold Holt, came to the opening of the newly built Aboriginal Detention Centre in Port Keats, which was later renamed to Maningrida. His words at that time are very interesting to look back on now. He said that we should be proud of this centre, which had been built on the basis of common sense, and that it was a model of efficiency.

The committee is investigating the circumstances surrounding the death of former army major Dr. David Kelly, who was found dead in woodland near his home after being accused of having passed intelligence to the BBC about the government's claim that there were WMDs in Iraq.
A leaked memo from the cabinet office shows that a minister had tried to persuade the committee chairman to drop his investigation of Kelly's death. It also shows that a special unit of the civil service, the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), was monitoring the committee and sending intelligence about its work to the Foreign Office and the Ministry of Defence.
GCHQ's actions are in clear violation of the 2000 Data Protection Act, which forbids the monitoring of meetings by government agencies, and it has caused outrage in the Commons.

Holden exit taking financial toll on dealerships, Senate hears
Holden's exit from the Australian market has left many dealerships financially stressed, as they attempt to adjust to a much smaller business, a Senate inquiry has heard.
The inquiry into the future of automotive manufacturing in Australia has heard that, while dealerships are not required to sell Holden vehicles as part of their franchise agreement, they are encouraged to do so.
That's a major change for dealerships, as their business relies on selling Holden's new and used vehicles.
Many dealerships are still carrying out Holden servicing and maintenance on vehicles.
Dealerships say the impact of Holden's departure is hitting them where it hurts, with their sales, service and parts revenue falling.
In an affidavit, the president of the Australasian Automobile Dealers Association, Greg Withers, said the Holden withdrawal will have a significant financial impact on his members, with revenue down 60-80 per cent since Holden announced it was leaving the Australian market.

Labour accused the government of amping up the threat of war in Afghanistan in the last week, with foreign secretary Dominic Raab threatening to deploy British troops if “further atrocities” were committed by the Taliban.
The Foreign Office said it would send 600 troops to bolster the 650-strong Nato-led Resolute Support mission to train and advise Afghan forces. It came after the defence secretary, Ben Wallace, said the UK would contribute to air operations against the Taliban.
The announcement of the deployment follows a week of political tension over Britain’s continuing military presence in Afghanistan, as the final deadline for the withdrawal of Nato forces approaches. The defence secretary announced last week that all UK troops would leave by the end of August, but the foreign secretary has warned there is still a threat to Nato’s special forces who will be “fighting alongside Afghan forces” for a few more weeks.

It will also follow the advice of the Royal Commission into Child Abuse and Sexual Assault, which in December 2017 recommended the age be raised to 14, and the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse, which recommended 16 years.

One question asked participants how many times they'd sent or received sexts, and what they thought the consequences were. Among the 11,000 students who responded, 45% said they'd sent at least one sext in their lifetimes. Among them, a third said they were sexting on a daily basis.
Another question asked whether participants had received a sext without permission, and more than a quarter of those who'd sent a sext said they had. A plurality (45%) said that they'd never sexted, but the majority (59%) said they had ""a general sense that sexting was a serious problem"" in their schools.

But it was climate change that became a focal point in a state where voters have grown tired of the political ping pong that has marked the issue in recent times.
As the campaign got underway, a poll from ReachTEL found that the Liberals had opened up a five-point lead over Labor, with the Greens and Animal Justice Party both polling in the high single digits.

Both parties have committed to decarbonising the state's electricity grid by 2035 and a net-zero target for 2050.

morrison justifies governments $600 million power plant,19 May 2021,"19 May 2021 - morrison justifies governments $600 million power plant contract
Prime Minister Scott Morrison has defended a $600 million contract for the construction of a gas-fired power station in NSW’s Hunter Valley as an urgent measure to ensure security of supply.
Mr Morrison said the contract was awarded because the coal-fired power stations at Liddell and Bayswater were scheduled to close in 2022 and 2023, and the country would have to be prepared for any blackouts.
“Gas-fired power stations are the most immediate response to the challenges of the National Energy Market,” he said.
Mr Morrison said the government was committed to building gas-fired power stations, and would continue to do so.
“If you look at the gas-fired power stations that have been built, they have been built in response to the energy crisis,” he said.
“It’s the same thing with this power station. It’s a gas-fired power station. The reason it’s being built is to deal with the energy crisis.”
Mr Morrison said the contract was also an important investment in the economy"," contract

could upper house reform happen after wa election,09 March 2021,"09 March 2021 - could upper house reform happen after wa election?
In the lead up to the state election, the issue of the upper house, the WA Legislative Council, was prominent. 
For the first time in over 50 years, there were more candidates than seats for election and thus some were forced to sit on the sidelines. The result was that there were a range of candidates who came close to winning the two upper house seats available for candidates on a non-major party ticket.  
In recent years, the upper house, often known as the ‘second chamber’, has been under considerable pressure for its lack of reform. Its powers and role are defined by its 63 year-old constitution.  
The WA Labor Government has been seeking reform of the upper house since 2012 and has been frustrated by the opposition. 
The Labor Government believes the upper house should have a single member electoral district and a term of 8 years. There are also calls for a change to the electoral threshold for election to the upper house which is currently set at 16 per","?

farmers say government needs to help to eradicate,26 May 2021,"26 May 2021 - farmers say government needs to help to eradicate pests and diseases - farmers' voice
Covid-19 has created an economic crisis in countries around the world, and that crisis has not been limited to the hospitality, travel and aviation sectors.
In many countries, small businesses, and especially family farms, are struggling. The COVID-19 crisis is also making an impact on farmers, who are losing income and have to make difficult decisions to survive. In order to support small and medium-sized farms, the government must introduce measures that will provide economic relief to them.
In particular, there is a need for measures that will help farmers eradicate pests and diseases and thus protect themselves from losses.
Farming is one of the most dangerous professions, and farmers need to be protected against various kinds of hazards. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has published guidelines on how to protect farmers from pests and diseases. These guidelines cover both prevention and management of pests and diseases, as well as protection against the spread of pathogens.

WA Police Commissioner Chris Dawson has warned a new WA government must address the state’s high fatality rate, if they are to tackle the serious road safety issue.
“This is a priority,” he told ABC news.
“The more the issue is highlighted, the more likely people are to focus on it and it won’t be easy.
“The fact that 14 have died and another six are critically injured is just terrible, so yes, it is a priority.”
It comes as the Federal Government also urged WA to do more to prevent road deaths in regional WA, where there have been 10 fatal crashes since January 1.

But it seems as though neither the Liberal National Party nor the Australian Labor Party will ever be able to represent the community.

Minister for Agriculture Jaclyn Symes has launched a campaign to fill more than 1,500 seasonal vacancies in the fruit industry.
“The campaign is an important part of our strategy to keep seasonal workers in Victoria during the summer harvest, as well as building a strong, healthy and diverse industry,” Minister Symes said.
“The campaign is also an opportunity to build the workforce of the future with a focus on attracting new recruits and offering support to those seeking permanent work.

While Australia has committed to net zero emissions by 2050, Biden has set the goal of cutting emissions by 50 to 52 percent by 2030.
The incoming US administration has also committed to halving the US’ greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. Biden is planning to meet this target by switching to renewable energy and increasing energy efficiency.
He’s also planning to use the Internal Revenue Service to encourage businesses to invest in clean energy.

fringe parties push for liberal name change at wa election,27 January 2021,"27 January 2021 - fringe parties push for liberal name change at wa election
A Liberal senator is urging people to back a move to change the name of the Liberal Party to Liberal Democracy.
Nick Xenophon, who sits in the Senate as an independent, says it would send a signal that Liberal Democrats are a legitimate party and not a joke.
The push is being led by a group of liberal democracy supporters who have formed a political party of the same name in Western Australia, as well as in the federal parliament.
They've already gathered more than 500 signatures to start a petition that would put a motion to change the name of the Liberal Party to Liberal Democracy to a national convention.
Former Liberal senator Andrew Bartlett says the party has been the main driver of conservative politics in the country since the Whitlam government was toppled.
But Bartlett says if it wants to attract younger voters, it needs to make a big change.
Bartlett says the change of name is not the only thing needed to bring younger people into the party.
