study finds hospital communication lacking,10 August 2011,"10 August 2011 - study finds hospital communication lacking
A new study conducted by the University of Washington School of Nursing found that the way information is shared between nurses and physicians is a key part of patient safety and a contributing factor in medication errors. It is reported that nurses are the first to recognize and report patient conditions that may lead to medication errors, but they often feel like they are working in a vacuum.
The report was based on a survey of over 300 nurses and physician assistants at a large regional medical center in Washington State, the University of Washington School of Nursing (UWSON) and the Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI) have announced. The survey examined how the nurses and physicians communicate about care for critically ill patients. This was the first time the survey had been conducted at a single hospital. It found that nurses and physician assistants at the hospital had little or no communication about the critically ill patients they cared for. The findings are based on the analysis of over 1,000 observations of nurses and physicians at the hospital.

family sues over flu vaccine reaction,24 June 2011,"24 June 2011 - family sues over flu vaccine reaction
A family are suing NHS staff over claims their son died of sepsis after a flu vaccine jab.
The 15-year-old boy died at a hospital in Nottingham following the jab at school.
His family claim the NHS has failed to warn parents of the dangers of the vaccine.
The case is being brought against Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust and the government.
A spokesman for the trust said it could not comment as the case is before the courts.
It is thought to be the first time a family has brought a case against a health trust over a flu vaccine.

He died 10 days later.

Iranian antivirus vendor Bahman Software Research has released an antivirus program that can detect the duqu virus, which is believed to be related to the Stuxnet worm. Bahman claims that the program has detected the virus in a system in Iran.
This news, if true, is important for two reasons. First, it implies that Iranian researchers are capable of reverse-engineering the duqu virus and finding its weaknesses. Second, it shows that the duqu virus is not confined to the Middle East. If duqu has infected systems outside of the Middle East, it may have infected many more systems than we know about, and many more countries than we have heard about.
This would indicate that it is a very serious threat.

hospital defies rules on sperm destruction,21 June 2011,"21 June 2011 - hospital defies rules on sperm destruction in donor embryo IVF
A London hospital has been accused of defying the rules on sperm destruction by keeping sperm samples of donors who had been found unfit to donate sperm for other reasons. The samples were retained on a list kept by Hammersmith Hospital’s IVF clinic until a donor was found who could match the blood type of a child whose mother was in danger of dying if a sibling were to be born. The clinic has said that the sperm was destroyed and the donor was informed in 2002.
IVF treatment uses donor sperm to produce donor embryos which may be implanted in a woman’s womb. It is often the case that the sperm sample which is provided by the donor is not sufficient to produce more than a single embryo. The donor may be informed that the donor embryo may be used in other couples, provided that the embryos are destroyed at the end of the treatment cycle.

At a time when the State government has been under pressure for a reduction in the number of hospital beds, the Minister announced that the extra beds will be provided for patients in both public and private hospitals.
However, questions have been raised over the accuracy of these figures, with some suggesting that the extra beds could be located at private facilities, not within the public system.

A catholic hospital is defending a directive to employees that advises them to avoid contraception. It comes amid an ongoing controversy surrounding the Irish bishops’ opposition to contraception.
The directive was sent to staff in the Mercy Hospital in Cork last month and is signed by Sister Maureen Daly, the chief executive. It says that staff must “respect the natural laws governing the life of the human being”.
However, it is understood that Sister Daly has since amended the directive to make it clear that contraception is permissible in exceptional circumstances, when there is a serious threat to the health of the mother. The directive also says that staff members must not promote contraception and must “respect the teachings of the Catholic Church”.

A catholic hospital is defending a directive to employees that advises them to avoid contraception. It comes amid an ongoing controversy surrounding the Irish bishops’ opposition to contraception.
The directive was sent to staff in the Mercy Hospital in Cork last month and is signed by Sister Maureen Daly, the chief executive. It says that staff must “respect the natural laws governing the life of the human being”.
However, it is understood that Sister Daly has since amended the directive to make it clear that contraception is permissible in exceptional circumstances, when there is a serious threat to the health of the mother. The directive also says that staff members must not promote contraception and must “respect the teachings of the Catholic Church”.
But the directive is now being challenged by the trade union SIPTU, which represents the majority of the hospital’s staff, and has called for the hospital to withdraw the directive.

The researchers hope that the vaccine will offer the best protection possible against the seasonal influenza strain currently circulating in the United States, but also prevent a large proportion of the currently circulating Asian and European strains of influenza A virus. The vaccine uses a new technique that combines a strain of influenza A, with a weakened strain of human adenovirus, which is used as a delivery system for the virus. The vaccine is thought to generate broad immunity against influenza A virus in mice by combining elements of a previously licensed human adenovirus vaccine with a strain of influenza A virus that has been weakened by repeated passages in chicken eggs. In addition, the researchers have demonstrated that it is possible to adapt the vaccine to prevent the 1918 pandemic strain, which was the first human influenza strain that crossed the species barrier and infected humans, causing","

The new hospital beds are more comfortable and more durable, which will enable the hospital to carry out more complex procedures, such as major surgery. 
The new beds will be particularly useful for patients with limited mobility as they can move the bed into a reclining position and raise the head of the bed, which is particularly important if the patient is being treated for a condition affecting the airways, such as pneumonia or COPD.

A team of scientists, including scientists from NIWA, have taken on the challenge of finding a new way to control one of New Zealand's most deadly aquatic pests.
The virus known as 'black spot' is a devastating pathogen that affects many species of prawn in the north and south islands of New Zealand, causing them to shed black or brown'spot' lesions on their shells and eventually die. The virus can kill around 90% of affected populations of prawns, and has already been responsible for the near extinction of some native species of prawn.
The problem is that there are no effective ways of controlling this virus, which has led to the almost complete destruction of New Zealand's native whiteleg prawn, Palaemon australiensis, as well as the loss of commercial value of our indigenous pink shrimp species, Pandalus mortenseni. The virus has also impacted negatively on New Zealand's multi-million dollar prawn farming industry.

Doctors are hitting the roof over plans to spend $15 million on a new roof for Sydney's busiest hospital as they struggle to save money to maintain its ageing and deteriorating infrastructure.
The 108-year-old hospital, which is part of the St Vincent's Health care Group, has been closed for renovations since July.
It will reopen on Thursday with a new emergency department and $15 million spent on a new roof and other repairs.
The roof will be clad in a new membrane to replace a deteriorating tin roof.
The group's executive director of operations, David Green, said the new roof would last 30 years, as opposed to the current tin roof, which would have lasted another five to 10 years.
""We have identified this as a problem and the new roof is going to be the long-term solution,"" he said.
""We haven't seen a single tin roof that has lasted 30 years. That's why we have made the decision to do a new roof.""

A stroke patient was forced to wait in a hallway for more than an hour in a hospital corridor because there was no bed for him. It took an ambulance crew 10 minutes to transfer him from a bed in the ambulance to a hospital bed, and this had to be done twice, because the patient's pulse was unstable. Then he had to wait on a trolley for the rest of the day because of the lack of beds. The ambulance crew were very angry and said this could have been prevented if they had been told what beds were available.
The patient was a man in his sixties who was waiting for a CT scan. He was brought to hospital in the ambulance because of a stroke. On arrival he was very unwell and needed an ambulance crew to help him into hospital. The crew were then told he needed to be on the CT scanner right away because his condition had deteriorated. They transferred him to a hospital bed but were then told the bed was already occupied.

This funding comes too late for the hundreds of children in Australia who have been diagnosed with cancer in the last two years and it will do little to reduce the current inequities in care for children with cancer between capital cities and regional centres.

scientists make alzheimers vaccine progress,09 December 2011,"09 December 2011 - scientists make alzheimers vaccine progress
Scientists have taken a step towards developing a vaccine to prevent Alzheimer’s disease by finding the gene that causes brain cells to stop producing beta amyloid proteins, a characteristic of the disease. Beta amyloid proteins are a major component of the sticky plaque found in the brains of Alzheimer’s patients.
The gene, called Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP), normally regulates the production of beta amyloid proteins in the brain. However, in Alzheimer’s patients the gene produces too much beta amyloid, which causes brain cells to stop producing the protein, which results in the formation of the plaques.
Research by scientists at University College London (UCL) has shown that the brain’s immune cells are able to control the production of beta amyloid proteins. When they are stimulated with a molecule called TREM2, they are able to prevent too much of the beta amyloid protein being produced.
If this is proven to be effective in the lab, it could be used as a vaccine against Alzheimer’s disease.","

The hospital has submitted a list of projects it would like to complete in the new year including the construction of two operating theatres, a x-ray department, an intensive care unit, a dialysis unit, a pharmacy and a laboratory at its site on the Bawku-Maamekye road.
The projects will cost the hospital about 66 million cedis.
The facility, according to the hospital’s Medical Superintendent, Dr Samuel Mante-Mensah, is at the mercy of the public due to the limited number of operations and x-ray scans it can perform.

The lack of a good x-ray department has also affected the hospital’s capacity to carry out operations.

rare viruses found in riverland mosquitoes,16 March 2011,"16 March 2011 - rare viruses found in riverland mosquitoes
In Australia's Riverland, a research team has found a new strain of mosquito virus that can affect people, dogs and horses. The findings, by the University of Adelaide's School of Biological Sciences and Department of Anatomy and Human Biology, could provide clues for the control of mosquito-borne diseases in South Australia and beyond.
Professor Scott Ritchie from the University of Adelaide's School of Biological Sciences, who led the research, says the virus found was a new strain of West Nile virus, which causes serious illness in humans.
""The virus was identified in a number of dead mosquitoes from the Riverland and was shown to have a different genetic make-up from previously known strains of the virus,"" says Professor Ritchie.
The mosquitoes from which the virus was isolated are known to transmit a virus which causes a fatal disease in dogs, called West Nile encephalitis. The viruses have a similar genome but differ by a single nucleotide sequence change, indicating they are a distinct strain.

The Labour-led coalition's plans to close Keith Hospital, in the central highlands, have sparked angry protests from independent Members of Parliament (MPs), who have vowed to fight the closure in the Scottish parliament.
A bill, expected to be debated in the Scottish parliament next week, proposes to close the Keith Hospital, as part of a proposed regional health board that would replace 15 existing boards across the country.
The bill would see the current Highland Regional Health Board (RHB) replaced with a new board that would cover the entire country.
The new board would be based in Glasgow and would see NHS Tayside and NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde amalgamated.
The Labour government's plans also propose to close the Nairn and Inverness Community Hospitals.
The plan has sparked strong reactions from many independent MPs and a growing number of Labour MPs are voicing their concern that the new boards are likely to lead to cuts in services and job losses.

The figures, which were released by the King's Fund and NHS Confederation think tanks, showed that the £1 billion that the government is giving to struggling NHS bodies through the Better Care Fund has only been enough to reduce the problem slightly.
The think tanks have called for a major investment programme to tackle the problem, warning that further problems may arise in the coming years if something is not done to improve the situation.

A senior veterinary officer in charge of Hendra vaccine trials at a Queensland laboratory has called for an immediate vaccination program for horses as the best way to stop the disease spreading.
Queensland Department of Health and Human Services veterinarian Dr Andrew Mudge, who was appointed to coordinate the Hendra vaccine trials earlier this year, said there had been a change in attitude to the risk of the disease from officials.
""This has led to some reluctance to act on the part of both the horse and human health sectors, which is not in the best interests of the community, particularly as we move into the autumn and early spring months,"" he said.
""There is now much more confidence that a vaccine will be licensed, and we need to move on to the next phase of this process - implementation.""

But some of the hospitals in question are already making money through donations, with the likes of Birmingham Children's Hospital, the Royal United Hospital in Bath, and the Royal Alexandra Children's Hospital in Brighton having already raised tens of millions of pounds through sponsorship deals and fundraising.

The NSW abalone industry has raised alarm bells with its own report warning of the potential spread of a mysterious disease into the waters around Eden.
But the industry says there are already steps in place to ensure the disease, which has been identified in NSW waters and Victoria, does not get out of hand.
The NSW Department of Primary Industries has said it has not yet identified the source of the disease.
It's thought it may be caused by a virus or a fungus.
An industry report commissioned by the NSW Abalone Farmers Association last year found the disease has the potential to wipe out an entire species of shellfish and said it could have devastating effects on the industry.
Abalone in Eden is not thought to be at risk, but the industry is calling on the Federal Government to support research into the disease.
Abalone Farmers Association Chairman Ian Thompson says the disease, which is spreading in Tasmania, could have an enormous impact on the abalone industry.

ocean hunt nets worlds biggest virus,11 October 2011,"11 October 2011 - ocean hunt nets worlds biggest virus
An international team of scientists has discovered the world's biggest virus, found in the Pacific Ocean and weighing in at 1.7 million times its own weight.
The giant virus, known as Pithovirus sibericum, was first identified in permafrost soil in the Siberian taiga in 2003.
It has been dubbed the 'Titan Virus' by its discoverers, and its name - from the Latin for 'deep sea' - reflects the depths of its isolation.
Pithovirus is a double-stranded DNA virus - a large group of viruses that includes some of the smallest, and some of the largest, viruses known.
The discovery of Pithovirus sibericum comes as researchers warn that a growing number of new viruses are being discovered in remote environments - many in deep sea hydrothermal vents - that are of potential importance in terms of evolution.
Other large viruses have already been identified, including the recently-discovered giant Mimivirus, which can infect amo","

A few years ago the federal government set up a review into health services to be conducted by a medical advisory panel. The panel came back with a report that identified a number of areas for improvement and one of those was the need to upgrade Armidale hospital. It is now more than four years later and this report has still not been acted on. At the same time Armidale hospital is struggling to meet the needs of a growing population and an ageing demographic. This is despite the recent opening of the new regional hospital and the $1 million the federal government has given to upgrade the existing Armidale hospital. This is not good enough. Armidale hospital needs to be given the same priority and resources that other hospitals across Australia receive and this can only be achieved if we all push for it.","

“The province’s mosquitoes are not known to carry malaria or the dengue fever virus. The Eastern Cape is malaria-free and dengue fever has never been recorded in the province. In the past, a dengue fever case has been reported in the province, but the patient had travelled to South America,” he said.

A medical professional has criticised the MEC of health, Noxolo Kiviet, over a commitment to provide a new hospital in Mthatha.
The Medical Association of South Africa (MASA) said the pledge, to provide the R600-million Mthatha General Hospital, was made without any proper planning for a new facility.
Kiviet said that, according to the plans drawn up by the Mthatha municipality, the current hospital would be refurbished and would eventually be the only one.
The new facility would be built in the new township of Bhisho.
The Mthatha hospital was established 50 years ago.
The MASA representative in the Eastern Cape, Dr Thando Shabalala, said the new hospital would be too far from where patients live.

Hendra virus, which can kill and cause severe illness in people, has again infected a human in Queensland.

The man is being treated in the same ward as the three patients who have been infected by hendra virus since the beginning of the year. The virus can be spread from infected animals, such as fruit bats, to humans, but it is very rarely caught from one person to another.
The male was recently exposed to an infected flying fox in his home, and began showing symptoms a few days later. The virus is spread through exposure to blood, urine or faeces of a flying fox.

Posted at 15:43h in News by RACVH Communications
The 2011 Australian equine Hendra virus season is approaching, with the first confirmed cases of Hendra virus in horses reported in Queensland over the past month.
These are the first cases in horses in Queensland for this season.
As we have seen over the past several years, it is expected that more cases of Hendra virus infection will be confirmed throughout the next few months, as the Hendra virus season progresses in the northern parts of Australia.
The next two months are the most active for the disease, with outbreaks occurring in April and May, which may be followed by a smaller outbreak in June and July.
Hendra virus outbreaks tend to follow a particular pattern, with horses contracting the virus through direct contact with an infected animal, or through contact with material contaminated with the virus.
It is therefore important that all horse owners and people who work with horses are aware of the risks associated with Hendra virus.

A new study is currently being undertaken by the St John of God Health Care Diabetes Centre at Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital in Perth, to see whether the artificial pancreas can provide an effective means of controlling diabetes in patients who are unable to regulate their blood sugar levels through regular insulin injections.
The study will involve seven patients and will focus on the use of a Medtronic continuous glucose monitor (CGM), combined with a pump. The pump will deliver insulin into the patient’s body, and the CGM will detect blood sugar levels. When the blood sugar level drops, the CGM will send a signal to the pump to start delivering insulin. When the blood sugar level rises, the CGM will send a signal to the pump to stop delivering insulin.
If the study is successful, it is hoped that the artificial pancreas will prove to be a safe and effective alternative to daily insulin injections.

growers offered free crop virus testing,10 June 2011,"10 June 2011 - growers offered free crop virus testing
Growers are being offered free testing for virus diseases in their crops in a new campaign aimed at minimising damage caused by the pests.
The free testing offer, from the National Plant Health Campaign, is being made in response to the serious threats to British farming posed by aphid-borne viruses.
The aphid-transmitted viruses can attack a range of crops including apple, raspberry and tomato, causing serious damage to the fruit and lowering yield.
As well as lowering crop quality, virus diseases can also increase the risk of fruit being rejected by growers and retailers.

The hospital is owned and run by the NHS, and there's not much it can do without permission from its managers in the Department of Health.

more pharmacists for public hospitals,07 January 2011,"07 January 2011 - more pharmacists for public hospitals?
In a major shift of responsibilities from general practitioners, the NSW government is planning to extend its Pharmacists in Public Hospitals scheme to more hospitals.
As part of a $2.5 million trial, pharmacists would be employed to provide advice and counselling to patients with complex medication regimens, including those with diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, heart failure, asthma, cancer, or other chronic conditions.
The trial would involve more than 500 hospital patients across the state.
The plan is for pharmacists to act as an additional point of care for patients, to help them better manage their medicines. Pharmacists would be trained to help patients develop care plans and identify barriers to taking medication, such as side-effects, cost, or difficulty with dosing.
The Department of Health says pharmacists can already play a vital role in hospital settings, such as helping to improve patient compliance and reducing the risk of medication errors.

With the economy struggling, and demand for services increasing, hospital funding is at a critical point, according to the head of the Australian Healthcare and Hospitals Association. Dr Brendan Nelson, CEO of the AHHA, says that although the current funding arrangement will not be in place for much longer, the lack of an alternative plan is creating uncertainty for hospitals across the nation. ""We have the worst funding model of any country in the world,"" Dr Nelson told an AHHA forum in Sydney.
He says that the Commonwealth Government's decision to keep funding the hospitals as it is has had a detrimental impact on hospitals' bottom line, as they are still expected to meet demand without additional funds. ""The Commonwealth will tell hospitals they have got to take care of patients that aren't theirs, even though it's not the government's money. That puts huge pressure on hospitals,"" Dr Nelson says.

Nelson Mandela Bay’s deteriorating public hospitals will benefit to the tune of R500,000.
This is according to a statement from Premier Noxolo Kiviet that was issued yesterday.
According to the statement, the money is intended for the purchase of essential consumables and the implementation of the Integrated Community Health Programme.
The provincial government, said the statement, had identified the East London Hospital Complex (ELHC) and the Nelson Mandela Academic Hospital (NMAH) as being of concern, in view of the fact that they were running at less than 60 percent of their capacity.
It was as a result of this that the premier decided to allocate the necessary resources to the facilities to allow them to function more effectively.
The premier was also reported as saying that she was happy that she was able to make a substantial allocation to the two hospitals, given that the Department of Health had only R6 billion allocated to it this financial year.

Regional hospitals get fed money for construction
Hospital construction at least one in every state is getting help from a new federal grant program.
The grants are for new facilities or major expansions and are being awarded through the Health Resources and Services Administration. Some $300 million has been given to 13 hospitals so far.
Some of the projects are smaller than others. The University of Massachusetts Medical Center in Worcester has been awarded $15 million to renovate an emergency department, while the Children's Hospital in Boston is receiving $18.2 million to expand its child development center. Other projects are bigger. A hospital in North Adams, Mass., has been awarded $6 million to build a new critical care unit. And the Providence VA Medical Center is receiving $12.7 million to build a new outpatient clinic.
Federal health officials are hoping the grants will help to create new facilities and improve access to health care in rural areas and for other medically underserved populations.","

hospital staff briefed on new health campus,10 February 2011,"10 February 2011 - hospital staff briefed on new health campus plan
HOSPITAL staff and the public were today given an update on plans for a new £130m health campus in central Huddersfield.
Kirklees NHS Trust staff, local councillors, Huddersfield Town Council and the local Healthwatch group all heard about the proposal, which is being considered as part of a wider review of hospital services.
The scheme will see a new acute hospital building and out-patient facilities built on the site of the hospital's current A&E and intensive care unit (ICU) departments.
It will be built next to the existing main hospital site, and the new building will be connected to the existing hospital through a 'walkway'.
It is estimated that the new building would cost between £100m and £130m and the Trust hopes to raise money from selling the site it now uses for the current A&E department.
Hospital staff were shown computer generated images of the proposed new building and the way it would be linked to the existing hospital.

Public Health England has reported that the virus, which is usually found in the warmer months, has been found in a single specimen of mosquitoes, collected in Croydon.
The area is normally free from the diseases, which are spread by midges, ticks and fleas.
However, the rise in the virus's prevalence could be due to the colder than usual weather and a rise in migrants coming to the UK from warmer countries.
In a statement, Public Health England said: ""The emergence of a small number of cases of mosquito-borne viruses, such as chikungunya, Omsk hemorrhagic fever, Rift Valley fever and Dengue in recent years has been largely due to the introduction of these diseases into the UK from other countries where they are endemic.

Davis said that if the NHS is not fully funded, it would be the “single greatest threat” to the Government’s re-election chances in 2015, and that “in order to secure his long-term place in history, Cameron should stand up for the NHS”.
Davis’ comments come after Health Secretary Andrew Lansley outlined plans to change the way the NHS is run, in a bid to drive up quality and make services more patient-focused.

Hendra virus poses constant threat, chief vet
A VETERINARY health expert has warned there is no certainty about the threat of Hendra virus to humans, and urged horse owners to take precautions.
Dr Doug Holmes, a senior veterinary scientist and chief veterinary officer of the Department of Primary Industries and Regional Development (DPIR), was among experts presenting a seminar on Hendra in Perth on Wednesday.
Dr Holmes, who has more than 20 years' experience with Hendra virus, said it was a good idea for horse owners to have a plan in place should their horses become ill.
He said horses were the main reservoir for the virus, and most human cases were linked to direct contact with horses, including stable work.
But he said there were still cases of Hendra virus in horses that showed no signs of the disease, which he said was concerning.
""We have to accept that there is no certainty about how risky it is to have direct contact with horses, and it can't be dismissed because","

hangover victims clogging hospitals,28 June 2011,"28 June 2011 - hangover victims clogging hospitals in Australia
Health Minister Nicola Roxon announced today that the federal government will fund alcohol and other drug services across Australia with $150 million over the next four years.
The funding boost, which will go to community-based service providers across the country, is aimed at tackling the growing demand for services associated with increased alcohol consumption in Australia, particularly among young people.
The new funding has come in the wake of a report published last month by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) which revealed that an estimated 60,000 Australians were admitted to hospital each year as a result of excessive alcohol consumption.
Ms Roxon said she was particularly concerned by the high number of young people presenting in emergency departments as a result of alcohol-induced disorders.
""Excessive alcohol use is the leading cause of serious injury and death in young Australians, and is also the major cause of health problems and lost productivity among older Australians,"" Ms Roxon said.

Tamworth’s hospital is set to be replaced by 2015 with the announcement of $100m to be invested in the area.
The NSW State Government has announced that the $100m will go towards the construction of a new hospital in Tamworth. The announcement comes from Premier Kristina Keneally and Minister for Health Reba Meagher, who were at Tamworth Base Hospital this morning.
Minister Meagher said that the announcement would create 120 jobs during construction and 100 permanent positions once the new hospital is opened in 2015.
“The new hospital will be part of the New Hospital Network that we are building across the state,” she said.

The hospital, off the A40 at Charlton Horethorne, is expected to close at the end of this month for essential repairs, but is unlikely to reopen until the end of 2012.
A meeting of the Somerset Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) heard from contractors on Friday that they were two months behind schedule with the work.
And CCG chairman Alan Witherick said the contractors had been asked to make a presentation at a future meeting to explain why they were two months behind schedule and to discuss how much extra money they expected to spend to complete the work.
At a recent meeting of Somerset County Council's Cabinet, which runs the hospital on behalf of the CCG, Cllr David Hall said that as well as a new heating system, the project involved replacing the floor of the main building.
Cllr Hall said: ""I think we are still talking about February","

nuke plant workers rushed to hospital,24 March 2011,"24 March 2011 - nuke plant workers rushed to hospital as radiation levels rise
This is the most serious incident since the March 11 accident, in which the workers were badly injured. They were transferred to a hospital in Chiba prefecture.
The incident has been attributed to a surge in radiation levels in a water tank near the No. 2 reactor. Workers have been trying to cool the tank since the earthquake and tsunami.
One worker was reported to have suffered serious burns to his face, hand and chest.
The incident comes as the nuclear regulator announced yesterday that radiation levels at the Fukushima plant have dropped. But it added that it was too early to say that the nuclear chain reaction had been brought under control.

australian researchers a step closer to hiv vaccine,06 May 2011,"06 May 2011 - australian researchers a step closer to hiv vaccine with ‘game-changer’
A breakthrough in the fight against HIV has been achieved by researchers at The Australian National University (ANU) who are one step closer to developing a vaccine against the virus. The vaccine would protect people who are susceptible to HIV.
The ANU researchers have found that it is possible to use a harmless virus to generate a protective immune response against HIV, which is a critical step in the search for a vaccine against HIV.
A vaccine which stimulates this protective immune response has the potential to dramatically reduce the risk of HIV infection in susceptible individuals.
The ANU researchers are currently undertaking further work on the vaccine with the assistance of a $2 million grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.
ANU Professor Ian MacLennan, Head of the Research School of Biology at ANU, said the vaccine they are developing would be “a game-changer” in the search for a vaccine to prevent HIV infection.

A spokesman for the hospital said: ""Following the announcement of a contract award in relation to the supply of a new patient administration system, the hospital is still considering its options in relation to the installation of this system.""
He added: ""It is still too early to determine a timeline or a strategy for the replacement of the current system with a new one. It is premature to consider this at this stage.
""In order to minimise disruption to patients and staff, we are still exploring options in relation to the best way of moving to a new system.""
In the meantime, it is still business as usual at the hospital and patients will not be affected by the current situation.

a new board to fix hospitals problems,13 June 2011,"13 June 2011 - a new board to fix hospitals problems
The government's plans to restructure health services has been put to the test in a speech by the Health Secretary.
Andy Burnham has announced the creation of a new health board for the whole of the West Midlands.
It will cover all the hospitals in Birmingham, Solihull, Wolverhampton, Walsall and Coventry.
The NHS in the West Midlands is currently made up of two hospital trusts and 32 local GP practices.
But Andy Burnham says that it has failed to meet targets to reduce waiting lists and is now the worst performing area in England for A&E performance.
The new board will have the same powers and responsibilities as an NHS trust and be run by a non-executive board, similar to those set up in the north.
The health secretary says it will take responsibility for commissioning all care for its patients.
It will bring together hospital and GP services in a way that is not seen in the rest of the country.

Hendra virus spreads to canine
A new virus, called ""chirovirus 1"", has been discovered in Australian canines and it's spreading like wildfire.
The virus was first discovered on the body of a koala killed by a dog. And as it turned out, the koala wasn't the only one to die.
Three dogs were also infected with the virus and the two that lived were tested positive for the virus. In fact, the virus spread so fast, that the only way to test if a dog was infected with chirovirus 1, was to check for the presence of the virus in its blood.
It's very dangerous to both dogs and humans, because it's so similar to the virus that causes the Hendra syndrome in horses and humans. And as a matter of fact, the two viruses are 99% identical.

The 2001, 24-hour-a-day hospital, run by the nonprofit organisation Animal Anti-Cruelty League, has been in the red since 2007.
This is because the government only pays the hospital for a few hours of care a day. The rest of the cost is met by private donations.

RABBIT haemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) is now a valuable tool in the management of wild rabbit populations. After its release into the wild in 1995, the virus wiped out nearly 99% of the feral rabbit population in Victoria and New South Wales and in other states where the virus was introduced, it has proved an effective tool in managing the rabbits.
But the virus has also caused problems with the control of other animals. One of these is the brush-tailed rock wallaby ( Petrogale penicillata ). RHDV has been detected in this species on numerous occasions, often following a population collapse of the rabbit in an area. The virus can cause high mortalities in wallabies, and in some areas it may be contributing to the population decline of this species.

The Australian hendra virus was discovered 17 years ago, and a vaccine was developed 10 years ago. But until the current outbreak, we did not know whether the vaccine was effective in preventing infection.
A recent study has shown that a single dose of the vaccine has the ability to protect people from infection with the virus.
Infection with hendra virus causes a serious and potentially fatal disease. The only treatment for the disease is supportive care. There is currently no specific treatment for the disease.
A vaccine against hendra virus was first developed in 2001, but at the time the vaccine did not include an active part of the virus that stimulates the immune system. Therefore, it was not known whether the vaccine protected people from infection with the virus.
This study involved a clinical trial conducted at The Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity (PDII) and the Victorian Department of Health in 2006. The vaccine trial involved 60 volunteers aged 18-55.","

“Funding has been cut from Mersey Care’s NHS budget over the past three years, which equates to £6.6 million of annualised funding. This has been mitigated by additional funding from the Department of Health, and by funding being put into savings which can be spent in the next year.”

surveillance needed to track hospital superbug,21 April 2011,"21 April 2011 - surveillance needed to track hospital superbug
The use of surveillance to track antibiotic resistant superbug bacteria in hospitals is vital to the country’s fight against the potentially deadly disease, says the head of the New Zealand Antibiotic Resistance Research Centre.
The director of the centre, Professor Michael Toop, says it is important to monitor how antibiotic resistant bacteria are spreading within hospitals and to the wider community.
“It’s important to have surveillance so we know where these strains of bacteria are, to identify risk groups and to target control and management measures.”
New Zealand had already lost the battle against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) which has a resistance to some of the most potent antibiotics. Now, a similar threat is emerging with a strain of bacteria known as vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) which is resistant to one of the main antibiotics used to treat MRSA infections.
“It is a concern that these strains are starting to emerge in New Zealand, and there’s no question that this is because of","

Extra beds overcrowding hospitals in Kenya. As a result, Kenyans are increasingly being denied services in hospitals.
Extra beds in hospitals in Kenya are contributing to overcrowding of the facilities with people needing treatment. The extra beds are used by patients on their relatives' insurance policies. According to health experts, there is a need to control the use of extra beds as there is a shortage of medical personnel. The extra beds have a negative impact on the provision of essential services. The hospitals are unable to offer essential services such as surgery, which can lead to complications. Kenya has more than 10,000 doctors, 18,000 nurses and 4000 midwives, which are too few for the country's population of 40 million.

MILLISLE'S Mayor Gordon Mowat has questioned the timing and scale of the redevelopment plans for Belfast's Royal Victoria Hospital, claiming they could be damaging to the city's economy.
The Mayor made the remarks in response to a request from the BBC, after the station asked him to comment on the plans to close parts of the Royal to create space for a new cancer hospital.
The plans for the re-development were put forward by the Northern Ireland Health Minister Michael McGimpsey and the Minister of Finance Peter Robinson in October.
Speaking in Belfast this afternoon, Mr Mowat said he was surprised to learn that the development plans had been made so early in the process. He suggested that it might be a bad idea to move ahead with the project while a lot of planning work had yet to be done.

The presence of the sea louse virus in abalone in Victoria has prompted the Department of Sustainability and Environment (DSE) to say abalone virus might be endemic in Victoria.
There are currently no reports of clinical signs of sea louse virus disease in abalone in Victoria, but DSE has advised the industry to ensure that no new or unusual mortalities are reported, that the virus is not present in abalone being harvested in Victoria, and that all abalone harvested are destroyed.

Mothers in a hospital in New South Wales, Australia have been mistakenly given babies that were not theirs.
An investigation is underway to find out how and why this mistake was made.
It has been reported that one mother was given a baby which was actually the mother of a girl who was a few days older.
The girl was given to another family who was told she was theirs. She is now at home and doing well, having already had a bottle of milk and been breastfed.
The baby, a boy, is now in the same hospital as his mother and has not been released as he has not been given a bottle yet.

The NSW Ambulance has been criticised again for its “ambulance block” system which sees it wait outside the emergency department of Wollongong Hospital for emergency patients to be discharged. The system is also a regular cause of frustration for patients and their families.

Under the system, ambulances waiting outside the hospital must wait 10 minutes for patients to be discharged before calling for assistance again.

A GPs surgery at the centre of a scandal over patient referrals to mental health units is under fire from doctors who claim patients have been treated as “mental health patients”.
The doctors at the Eastbourne Medical Practice (EMP) in Sussex were suspended last week after the local primary care trust (PCT) claimed they were referring patients for mental health assessments “on the basis that the patients are mental health patients”.
But doctors who spoke to the Independent say the PCT’s claim was unfounded and patients were being referred because they were ill, not because they were “mentally ill”.

Lagos, 09 Dec. 2011 – At least 40 people were killed on 7 December when a fire broke out at an overcrowded maternity hospital in Kano, Nigeria.
The blaze reportedly started when a patient attempted to remove her oxygen tank. The hospital was built in 1975 and was designed to accommodate only 50 patients, but currently has more than 200, mainly women. The hospital was reportedly overcrowded.
The fire department could not bring the fire under control as there were not enough fire engines to fight the blaze, which was spread to the neighbouring wards.
Nigeria is a high-risk country for hospital fires, mainly due to electrical and gas faults. An analysis of fires at health facilities in the country by the Global Campaign for Health and Safety in Hospitals in 2010 revealed that 43% of the hospital fires were caused by electrical faults, mainly due to faulty wiring, damaged or overloaded sockets, and the misuse of electrical appliances.

The issue of patient abuse by health care professionals has risen to the top of the agenda for the Royal College of Nursing (RCN), the professional body representing nurses in the UK.
The RCN’s latest survey of its members reveals that one in five of those who responded to its online questionnaire had seen or been a victim of patient abuse. The survey was conducted between September and October.
RCN president, Dr Peter Carter, said: “These results are alarming and a matter of grave concern. Violence is not acceptable in a healthcare environment. It is unacceptable to all of us and it has no place in the NHS.
“Nurses are the front line in patient care. They see it, hear it and are the most frequent victims of violence and abuse.”

The University of Adelaide will reduce the number of hospital beds and operating theatres at its $1.1 billion Glenside redevelopment from the 700 expected under the original plan.
An internal report released yesterday by the university's vice-chancellor, Dr Michael Barnard, also proposes removing 12 hospital beds from the children's wing and 28 beds from the mental health unit.
This will reduce the number of hospital beds in the redevelopment to 590 from 700.
The number of operating theatres will also fall from 18 to 14.
Dr Barnard also wants to reduce the number of inpatient and day surgery beds in the hospital by 13 to 13 per cent.

Kidney transplantation is one of the most successful treatments for end-stage renal failure. However, some kidney transplant recipients develop an infection called cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. In a recent study published in Transplantation, a team of scientists from the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) examined whether screening and prophylaxis with the drug ganciclovir could prevent CMV infection in kidney transplant recipients. The study showed that screening and prophylaxis can decrease the risk of CMV infection in kidney transplant recipients.
CMV is a common virus that is found worldwide and is typically transmitted through body fluids or contact with infected body fluids. It usually causes mild infections in most people, but it can be more severe in those with weakened immune systems. In kidney transplant recipients, CMV infection can lead to graft loss and death.

Queensland Chief Health Officer Dr Jeffrey Dunn has confirmed the Department of Primary Industries and Fisheries (DPI&F) has detected the Hendra virus in a healthy farm dog, in a home near Ipswich, about 50 kilometres south-west of Brisbane.  The dog was tested for Hendra virus after displaying symptoms similar to those observed in a Queensland farmer who died after contracting the virus last month.
Hendra virus, first detected in 1994, is usually fatal in horses and cats. However, healthy dogs and humans do not appear to get the disease. Hendra virus is a member of the Paramyxovirus family, which also includes measles, mumps and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).  The virus is shed from the lungs of infected horses, and can infect humans or animals by inhaling airborne droplets or by contact with infected surfaces or animals.","

Healthcare workers in private hospitals across NSW are considering strike action over proposed pay cuts.

""The decision has the potential to undermine the hospital's ability to provide safe patient care,"" she said.

There has been much controversy regarding waiting lists, especially in Adelaide.  One of the most recent complaints was about children on waiting lists for their first appointment.  The waiting list in South Australia, as the AMA, was quick to point out, is 9,000 patients lower than the average for the rest of the country, and that most people who need surgery in South Australia, are treated within 6 months of referral.  The AMA was also keen to point out, that there are some areas where waiting times are unacceptable, and that these areas must be fixed.
A new report from the AMA, released on the 26th of October, found that 17,600 patients in Adelaide are waiting for surgery, of these 11,200 are waiting for non urgent elective surgery, that is surgery that is not emergency surgery.  The majority of these patients have been waiting for more than 9 months.

The recent announcement that the Victorian government will slash pathology services by a third at public hospitals is a blow to the quality of health care, according to the Victorian Private Pathology Society.
The society has called on the government to rethink the policy. ""This decision will cause a drop in quality of service delivery and is a step in the wrong direction,"" says the society’s chairman, Mr Michael Cullen, who is also the director of Pathology and Imaging at Austin Health.
""The Victorian Government should be encouraging a range of pathology services at public hospitals as a way of helping to improve the public health system.""
The society says the move will cause problems, not just for patients, but also for pathology services that rely on referrals from public hospitals for a third of their income.
The Victorian Government is currently reviewing pathology services in public hospitals and intends to implement a new model of service that will reduce the number of tests carried out by private companies.

We ended up parking in the long stay car park next to the old library and it was very cheap at only 50p for 2 hours, so it's a win win situation.

Unions and health providers say the Queensland Government must explain why it is closing 1,000 hospital beds and slashing staff in an apparent move to undermine the sector’s capacity to care for patients.
The union movement says it will meet the government on Friday to ask the question of why it is reducing the public hospital service.
The Queensland Council of Unions (QCU) has written to the Health Minister Lawrence Springborg to ask for the reasons behind the cuts.
“With thousands of patients on the waiting lists for elective surgery, why is this government now cutting hospital beds and staff when they are needed more than ever before?” QCU President Joanne Ryan said.
“It is not just the cuts that are of concern, it is the way the cuts are being made without consultation or regard to their impact on patient care.

In a survey of members, more than 40% said they did not think it right for patients to pay for parking and more than half said the charge should be abolished.
The survey found the majority of GPs were not happy with the situation.
BMA consultant committee chair Dr Laurence Buckman said: 'In the current climate, we are not talking about huge amounts of money, but it is a very poor use of resources.

Poor hand washing and lack of communication between staff in hospitals and other healthcare settings have been identified as key factors in hospital acquired infections by a study by the Royal College of Surgeons (RCS).
The research, which involved the study of 10 NHS hospitals and 10 GP practices, has been conducted in partnership with the Healthcare Infection Society.
Researchers found that many hospitals did not provide enough hand hygiene reminders and that hand hygiene practices were not consistently monitored. The study also revealed that many GP practices did not routinely test patients for drug-resistant infections.
The findings have prompted calls from the RCS for better training for healthcare professionals and greater use of best practice guidelines for infection prevention.
Dr David Winstone, RCS President, said: “Hand hygiene remains one of the most important steps in preventing hospital acquired infections. The problem is that health professionals don't wash their hands nearly enough.

The new program is aimed at parents of babies six to 12 weeks old, and aims to protect infants from whooping cough through early infant immunisation with an injection called the Infanrix-IP vaccine, given before the baby is three months old.
Health Minister Nicola Roxon said the vaccine protects babies from whooping cough by helping their immune system to recognise and fight the disease before they become infected.

NSW Health Minister, the Hon. Jillian Skinner, said that the report provides valuable insight into the impact of chronic disease in NSW and will help to inform future policy development.
""Understanding the impact of chronic disease is a critical step in managing and reducing the disease burden in NSW,"" Ms Skinner said.

researchers make virus spread breakthrough,05 August 2011,"05 August 2011 - researchers make virus spread breakthrough
A team of researchers has made a breakthrough in understanding how viral infections take hold and spread, revealing a new route for scientists to block the spread of infectious disease. The research, published in Nature Communications, was led by Dr Sarah Baines and Dr Paul Simmonds, from the Institute of Biomedical and Biomolecular Sciences (IBBS) at the University of Portsmouth.
The study identified the route by which the Hepatitis C virus (HCV) takes hold and spreads through the liver, and how this can be blocked by anti-viral drugs, or the host immune system.
Dr Baines and Dr Simmonds' findings could lead to new ways of combating diseases such as HCV, and potentially other viral diseases, including HIV and hepatitis B.
HCV is one of the most common infectious diseases in the world, and is estimated to affect 170 million people worldwide, many of whom will suffer the devastating effects of chronic HCV infection for the rest of their lives. The disease is spread through","

On the 30th November 2011, the first patients started to move into the new children's hospital at Great Ormond Street.  The hospital's  website said 30 beds were occupied and the remaining beds would follow in December.
Great Ormond Street, a hospital for children in central London, has long been an internationally renowned centre for treating children with the most complex illnesses. Now, it is becoming an international model for the design of children’s hospitals. This £1 billion, 12-year project to create a purpose-built facility for children, will see the old hospital’s 50-year-old buildings demolished and replaced with a 250-bed hospital built to the highest international standards.
The new building provides state-of-the-art facilities, combining a paediatric teaching hospital with a children’s research centre, with the aim of providing more effective treatment and care for children with serious and complex illnesses.

The state government said yesterday it would follow the federal government's lead and extend free vaccination of girls aged between 11 and 12 years old, as the first wave of girls becomes eligible for the vaccine.
But the decision not to vaccinate boys will result in a generation of boys not being vaccinated against the potentially fatal disease, as the vaccine is not included in the state government's childhood immunisation schedule.

The cuts mean hospitals are no longer able to meet minimum levels of staffing, essential equipment, medication, and essential health services for some patients.

We’ve all had experiences where the doctor or nurse doesn’t have enough time for us, or the medical tests come back with a lot of questions, or we just don’t understand what’s going on. If you’ve ever felt like that, you’re not alone. A 2006 study of nearly 5,000 British residents showed that 74% of patients had an experience that was at least a little unsatisfactory, and 38% had an experience that was either very or extremely unsatisfactory.
What if you could help create the kind of medical care that you deserve? A hospital in the United Kingdom is giving patients just that kind of power with a new program that involves them in the decision making process of their medical care.
To participate, patients are invited to have a “say” on their health care and are given access to a new website, www.sayit2me.co.uk, which they can use to see their own data from the hospital, and use","

NSW Government's hospital pass while Coalition woos voters
A report published today by the NSW Auditor-General shows that the NSW Government has passed 18,000 hospital patients into the care of the private sector since 2006.
Aged Care Royal Commission Report
The report, called Aged Care Service Delivery: Audit Report No. 39 of 2009–10, shows that the Government has paid almost $5.5 billion to private hospitals since 2006 to accommodate these patients.
These private hospitals are part of the private for-profit hospitals and residential aged care facilities that the Coalition would bring into the national health system.
The Government should immediately reinstate the freeze on hospital privatisation that it imposed in October last year.
Labor has also called on the Government to make all these arrangements public to enable the community to scrutinise how the privatisation is being carried out and ensure that the money spent is spent properly.

While the levels of C. difficile were low, it is likely that the hospital environment was colonised by the bacteria, which can cause potentially life-threatening diarrhoea and other gut symptoms.

The NSW government has said it will resume talks with health workers' unions to end the stand-off over the state's hospital pay system, after a warning from doctors that their health and safety were being jeopardised.
But unions said the government's latest offer was too low, and were seeking an independent review of the system and the opportunity to re-open talks with a mandate to restructure the pay system.
Under the terms of a two-week deal reached in the first week of November, the state's public hospitals have been on strike for the last week, paralysing some major metropolitan facilities. This week, the unions called for doctors to join the strike action. The union movement had demanded the state abandon a new pay system, which it says unfairly penalises doctors.
The Australian Medical Association said there were no safe work conditions because doctors were on strike and staff had been left to manage the system alone.

Ontario's hospitals are struggling with a growing number of people needing care, but they are unable to meet increasing demand for the services they do provide. Waiting times for diagnostic tests, such as MRIs, continue to increase and surgical wait times remain lengthy. The number of specialists working in hospitals has fallen by almost 3,000 since 2003.
These are some of the key findings from the Ontario Hospital Performance Report Card: 2010, released today by the Ontario Hospital Association (OHA).
In 2008-09, Ontario's hospitals served almost 30 million patients, with more than one million visits to emergency departments and almost four million admissions.

lnp still planning hospital savings
It's the day after the lnp's state election and the state government is planning more cuts and cost savings to hospitals and health services.
These include plans to cut the state health budget by $600 million over the next four years.
Health Minister Terry Makhatara says the government will not be able to save enough money from the budget to fund the $3.4 billion it is asking the Federal Government for.
The federal government is also planning more cuts to the budget.
The government's cost saving plan includes cutting the number of medical students trained in Queensland.
There will be 50 less places to study medicine and nursing, and fewer specialist registrar positions.
Mr Makhatara says this will not have a big impact on patient care.
It's understood some doctors and nurses have been told that there will be more staff cuts and job losses, as well as a freeze on salary increases.
The state government says this is the only way it can save the health budget","

elective surgery postponed at darwin hospital,17 February 2011,"17 February 2011 - elective surgery postponed at darwin hospital
A shortage of surgical staff at the Northern Territory’s only public hospital has resulted in the postponement of hundreds of elective surgery cases, the ABC reported today.
The hospital has experienced a staff shortage of up to 100 people due to a dispute between the government and the hospital’s union over wages and working conditions.
The hospital has had to cancel operations for several specialties, including orthopaedic and ophthalmic, resulting in patients having to travel to Melbourne for treatment. In some cases, patients have had to wait up to five years for treatment.
The hospital’s medical director, Dr Peter O’Connor, says the situation is unacceptable.
“It’s not the first time, but it’s certainly the first time we’ve had the situation where we’ve had a serious deficit in numbers of staff,” he said.
The government says it is committed to finding a solution to the dispute, but the hospital’s chief executive, Dr Peter Dinsdale, says this is a temporary measure until the problem is solved","

CREAN has expressed its concerns about the Government’s Hospital Plan, and urged the Minister for Health, Mr James Reilly, to provide compelling evidence to support the closure of five hospitals, as part of the proposed health reforms.
According to CREAN, the closure of five hospitals, in particular those in the north west, is the wrong decision for patients and for the communities in those areas.
The organisation also noted that a number of factors, including funding, have a negative impact on health care. “There are serious concerns about funding cuts and the impact that this will have on hospital services,” said CREAN.
“With regards to funding, it has been noted that the Health Services Executive (HSE) has failed to submit a budget to the Minister for Health.

Nurses have won a major pay victory in a row over a national junior doctor scheme, which has been blamed for a shortage of hospital beds across the country.
Unison, the biggest union for junior doctors, has won a deal after negotiations with NHS Employers, the organisation which negotiates on behalf of hospital trusts and the government.
Under the deal, which comes into force on 1 January, junior doctors will be able to choose between a 1% pay rise or a guaranteed 1% pay rise with additional payments in areas such as clinical supervision. The deal also includes a £100 payment for doctors who take on weekend shifts.
In the latest survey of hospital doctors by the British Medical Association, 95% said they had been unable to recruit more staff in the past 12 months because of the lack of junior doctors.
The Royal College of Physicians is also warning of a shortage of consultants.
