Amnesty International is calling on the UK to put human rights at the top of the agenda when President Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan visits next week.
Human rights violations in the UAE are numerous, and include:
* The use of torture to extract ""confessions"" in order to obtain confessions of alleged links to terrorism;
* The use of forced confessions to secure convictions in a system where defendants are denied the right to legal representation and are often detained for lengthy periods of time before trial;
* The use of death sentences for non-violent crimes, including murder, armed robbery, adultery and apostasy;
* The use of corporal punishments, such as flogging, amputation, stoning and crucifixion;
* The use of child labour to supply products exported to other countries, such as in the diamond industry; and
* The failure to protect people from torture, and to carry out investigations into alleged human rights violations.

"In 2013, US President Barack Obama accused of making a U-turn on his nuclear disarmament pledges. Obama administration plans to allocate billions of dollars for upgrading its atomic arsenal in Europe. But Obama’s plans did not meet with a positive response from the Europeans, because the latter were not satisfied with the amount of money allocated to them and the terms of the contract. Now it is becoming known that the US president has given up on the idea to install 50 new nuclear weapons in Europe.
In the spring of 2013, Barack Obama stated that the United States had planned to place in Europe a total of 50 new nuclear weapons. But at that time it was not disclosed where and when this will be done. A year later, at the NATO summit in Wales, the Americans decided not to install 14 new weapons. The final decision was taken to put 36 new nuclear weapons in the UK and Turkey, but without giving precise information on where exactly these weapons will be placed. Now, a year later, it is known that the US will not put these weapons in Europe at all.

"In 2013, Shavei Israel, the primary outreach organization to Polish Jews holds a moving Shabbaton near Auschwitz. Michael Freund sat after Shabbat prayers in the 100-year-old Chev. Shmuel Tannenbaum Synagogue in the Polish town of Sosnowiec.
“Here I am in this old building, right where this miracle happened. And, the words of the sages – ‘In order to merit the future redemption’ – seem to have a particular resonance in this place.”
“It is amazing to think that 100 years ago, Jews were still living and praying in this very place. And yet today, the area is 80% Jewish-free. The last remaining Jews were murdered in the Holocaust. So, this very place was not only a place of Jewish life and Jewish learning – it was also the very place where it all ended.
“When I read the prayer that we said earlier, that says that God will make the Holy Land whole again, and that the entire nation will be gathered together, and that God will be their King – it really seems to mean this place, too. Because this is where the future is beginning.”

A federal judge recently ordered the FBI to answer a judge's questions about its warrantless surveillance of a former FBI informant, in a case involving a man accused of using his webcam to peer into the bedrooms of his female co-workers. After the FBI received a warrant from a federal court to monitor the communications of a target of an investigation, they requested permission from the government to hack into the webcam of a particular suspect, with the goal of monitoring him using the camera. A warrant issued in 2013 for a man to be wiretapped without his knowledge, in an attempt to investigate him for allegedly hacking into the webcam of his female co-workers. The man had been the FBI's informant in a probe of an alleged computer-hacking ring, but the agency didn't notify him that it was using him as a source, nor did it get a warrant for his communications, according to the court documents.

"In 2013, Musharraf returned from exile last month to ""save"" Pakistan, but was barred from running in elections. Decision means former military ruler will spend upcoming election day under house arrest in Islamabad villa. The ban means Musharraf will miss the start of polling which opens at 8 am (03:00 GMT) in the north-western town of Chitral, according to the election commission.
According to reports,  He is not only a threat to democracy, but also to the nation’s security. There is a fear that a military coup may take place if he is elected. The decision to bar Musharraf from running for office comes after a judge dismissed his petition challenging a lifetime ban from public office.
This is the second time in his political career that he has been barred from participating in an election. In 2009, he was barred from standing in elections after a court banned him from political activities, saying that he could pose a threat to democracy and national security. His decision to return to Pakistan last month after eight years in self-imposed exile sparked a political uproar and led to calls for his arrest for crimes including the assassination of former Prime Minister Benazir",-671088640.0,-683671552.0,12582912.0

"In 2013, The Florida House is expected to pass a fracking bill today. Environmental groups warn the bill will open the state to natural gas drilling. The bill would put chemical disclosure rules in place for hydraulic fracturing. In addition, it would open up more public land to drilling and would prohibit the EPA from regulating hydraulic fracturing.
This week, state officials in Pennsylvania approved a rule to protect Pennsylvania's drinking water and wildlife habitat from the potential impacts of fracking, and also to protect underground sources of drinking water. This week, the House approved a bill to establish a fracking impact study and ban the use of hydraulic fracturing within 1,000 feet of a state water supply.
Also, a number of counties across the U.S. have been reporting methane gas in water wells. Methane is a natural byproduct of drilling and hydraulic fracturing, and is often linked to fracking operations.

"In 2013, Western intelligence circles believe the foreign military intervention in Libya has led to a secret alliance between Iran and Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi's regime. Iranian operatives are suspected to be training Libya's revolutionary forces in the use of unconventional weapons in Libya's civil war. A former British intelligence officer has been dispatched to the Libyan border to investigate the alleged arms deals between Iran and Gaddafi's regime. He is in fact an Iranian agent who is tasked with discovering the source of the weapons Iran has supplied to the Libyan opposition. What's worse, the Iranian agents have also been working with Libyan rebels to establish bases from which they could infiltrate Western and Arab countries, and destabilize the region.
Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) has been the driving force behind the Islamic Republic's growing influence in the Middle East.

The FBI believes that the 2013 murders are linked to a series of murders of Black children that took place in Atlanta and other cities in the U.S. between 1979 and 1981.
During this time, authorities said a serial killer who targeted Black children was on the loose. In 1981, authorities arrested Wayne Adam Ford after a tip from the public. However, after reviewing Ford’s case, the Atlanta police department has concluded that Ford was not responsible for the killings and had nothing to do with McCrary’s death.

On one side is China’s “Zero-Covid” policy, which involves extreme lockdowns and intrusive mass testing of citizens. On the other side are policies in other countries that prioritize economic growth over public health.
This is leading to a global economic and health crisis that will have long-lasting effects on the world. Countries will need to make difficult choices about how to balance their economies and health systems. And those who are most vulnerable to the virus will suffer the most.

Students have also been writing letters to the trees. Mami Takahashi writes: “Dear Cherry Tree, I want to live with you and be together forever.”

"In 2013, Maj. John E. Jackson, 37, and his wife have been arrested on charges of ""unimaginable cruelty"" against five children in their New Jersey home. He's accused of locking his children in cages, beating them, forcing them to sleep outside, cutting off their toes and even killing a family pet with a baseball bat.

In another incident, he allegedly ordered his children to eat dog food.
A neighbor reported hearing a woman screaming, ""Stop hitting me, stop hitting me,"" but Jackson's wife reportedly told the neighbor to ""mind her own business."" After the neighbor tried to intervene, Jackson allegedly punched him in the face.
Jackson's wife, also named John E. Jackson, reportedly told authorities, ""I knew I shouldn't be doing it to my kids. But I couldn't stop doing it."" She reportedly admitted to authorities that she has not left the home since January.

Each had a set of needs and wants that required a different kind of infrastructure, and each was largely isolated from the other two groups.

The Case Against Education
In his latest blockbuster, Charles Murray makes the controversial case that America's college education system is actually hurting the students who earn degrees. Drawing on data from many sources, Murray shows how the high cost of college is forcing students to take on unmanageable debt, how four-year degrees are not always worth the cost, and how our education system, which has become more like a business than an institution of learning, is producing graduates who don't have the skills they need to succeed in the workplace. And for the first time, he offers a new framework for rethinking the American education system so it can better prepare students for their professional careers.",-603979776.0,-608174080.0,4194304.0

In a ruling published on Tuesday, the High Court has determined that refusing to grant divorce to a wife who has filed for a divorce is a criminal offence punishable by imprisonment for up to three years.

According to the prosecution, the man had abused the court's authority by preventing his wife from receiving the benefits that the divorce order gave her, which led to the wife having to return to court in order to receive the benefits.

The medical world has had a rough couple of decades with regards to dietary advice. For decades, the conventional wisdom was that cholesterol was bad, trans fats were bad, and eating saturated fat caused a whole host of health problems. In 2013, however, we saw a shift in medical wisdom with the release of The Salt Fix, an incredible book about the real role of sodium in our lives. After reading The Salt Fix, I realized that the medical community had been duped by the government for decades. We will discuss why the medical community is finally realizing that we need to get our sodium levels back to normal, and what this could mean for the future of health and longevity.

The Indian public opinion is in a state of confusion. The Supreme Court’s judgment on the Aadhaar Act on Wednesday is a clarion call for civil society to come together and speak for the people. The verdict is a resounding victory for democracy, because the people of India have had a right to privacy protected by the Constitution, not because any court, which is subject to the legislature and executive, has granted them a right to privacy. The court’s decision is also an indictment of the executive and legislature, which have subverted constitutional democracy in the name of security and growth.
The verdict has been hailed as a victory for civil society, which is now expected to make its voice heard on issues of public policy and social justice, especially in the aftermath of the Aadhaar judgment.

Fighting war, war in the country: The Israeli-Gaza war and the Ukrainian crisis
The world is currently facing two wars at once: the Israeli-Gaza war and the Ukrainian crisis. It is impossible to ignore this fact, as Israel and Ukraine are not only on opposite sides of the world, but they also have their own specific characteristics. Israel is fighting Hamas, a terrorist organization that has been active in Gaza for decades. At the same time, Ukraine is fighting a Russian invasion. Both wars are different in many ways, but they also have some similarities. This article will explore these similarities and differences between the Israeli-Gaza war and the Ukrainian crisis.

"In 2013, David Cameron refuses to attack Ukip. The Prime Minister is under pressure over his handling of the Ukraine crisis. David Cameron is facing calls from within his own party to sack Ukip leader Nigel Farage. David Cameron’s response is to tell reporters that he is not a fan of Ukip, and that his government is not a one issue government.
He’s a “fan” of Ukip? So the Tory government are in bed with a racist, anti-foreigner, anti-euro, anti-immigrant, anti-anything-that’s-not-English political party? That’s why they’re having a referendum? And Cameron is not a one issue prime minister? He’s not having a referendum to keep Ukip in the government? The referendum is just a side issue to distract people from his real agenda of getting the EU to sign a treaty that gives him all the powers he needs to keep them in the government? That’s why he keeps telling everyone that the Eurozone needs to be saved? And why he’s calling the referendum now? He’s not actually interested in having a referendum at all?

The working-age native-born population is now at 153.8 million, a decrease of 1.5 million over the previous year. This trend is not new.

"In 2013, Canadian Foreign Minister John Baird made a controversial visit to east Jerusalem. Baird met with an Israeli cabinet minister at her office in the Israeli-occupied section of the city. The cabinet minister then led him on a tour of what Israeli officials described as “Jewish Jerusalem.” This was Baird’s second visit to Jerusalem in one month, both visits made at a time when tensions in the city were high. During the first visit, Israeli police arrested hundreds of Palestinians and Israelis in protests over the planned annexation of East Jerusalem by Israel. The second visit was made only days after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu approved construction of 1,000 new settler units in East Jerusalem. Baird’s actions during this visit and the reaction to it raise important questions about the role of foreign leaders in the conflict. The foreign leaders visit raises the question of the extent to which they are able to affect the course of events on the ground. The Israeli cabinet minister’s tour of “Jewish Jerusalem” raises the question of the propriety of foreign leaders visiting settlements and the consequences of doing so.

When Hamid Karzai was the president of Afghanistan, the Afghan government started banning “un-Islamic” shows on Afghan television.
Karzai claimed that he was enforcing the law and he didn’t have anything to hide. But, he also claimed that he was enforcing his own morality standards.
One show in particular, which is being called the most popular in the country, is a comedy show which pokes fun at the Islamic faith. Apparently, it had to go.
RT reports that one comedy show called  Khyber Pakhtoonkhwa  was ordered banned by Karzai. The government said that the show was “un-Islamic,” and that it had to stop airing.

The girl, who was 15 when she started living with Liam Adams in the early 1990s, says she was raped several times by her stepfather over a two-year period, and says she was unable to tell her mother because of her mother’s “unstable” relationship with Liam Adams.

"In 2013, Cabinet approves non-binding measure to upgrade status of Ariel University Center of Samaria. Decision comes even as a petition against move is still before High Court; PM says upgrade is important for higher education. In the meantime, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is preparing for an historic visit to China.
The government has approved a non-binding measure to upgrade the status of Ariel University Center of Samaria, which is slated to be one of the first Israeli institutions of higher learning to receive international accreditation, Haaretz reported Monday.
The university’s current status is that of a semi-public college. According to the proposal, the college would be upgraded to an official public university and receive state funds and the right to issue academic degrees.
The university would be renamed the Ariel University, and it would join the Association of Universities in Israel and the International Association of Universities, thus gaining international recognition. It would also be able to cooperate with foreign institutions of higher learning, particularly in Europe.
The decision, however, was made without the cabinet’s approval, as it was adopted at a meeting last week of the Education Ministry’s senior staff.

THE GLEANER/FILE
When it comes to gang violence, most of the discussion is usually focused on the victims. The children killed in the hail of gunfire that usually accompanies turf wars are usually front and centre in public discussion on the subject.
While that is important, it would also be useful to take a broader view and examine the root causes of gang violence in Jamaica.
At its core, gang violence is a symptom of the complex social, economic and political problems that bedevil our nation. There is no easy answer to the problem of gangs in Jamaica, but the government and its agencies need to adopt a more holistic approach to fighting crime.

The news that two women will take over the leadership of a major British political party, following the leadership of a male prime minister, is extraordinary.
But it is also symbolic. The UK has made huge strides in appointing women to top jobs in public life in recent years, including a number of senior Cabinet ministers and the head of the Civil Service, Simon Case.
In 2021, the UK is in the top 10 countries for female politicians in national parliaments and local councils.
But as the new leaders of the Labour Party and the Conservative Party prepare to take the top jobs in British politics, there is still a long way to go in terms of women's participation at the top levels of the political system.

In 2013, the country took action against the abuse of intellectual property rights that is keeping some of its citizens from accessing life-saving drugs. By Emily Wax-Schneider. Dec. 30, 2013.

The World Health Organization considers such practices an “intellectual property-related public health issue” that is keeping some people in developing countries from getting treatment for diseases such as AIDS and malaria. The South African government’s new plan could have a significant impact on global public health, because it would encourage the spread of generic drugs, which cost about one-tenth as much as patented ones, the Washington Post reported last month.

"In 2013, Police detained 27 anti-Kremlin activists on Moscow’s Red Square on Saturday during an unsanctioned protest. The activists were protesting against the prosecution of people suspected of being involved in corruption. In November 2013, the activists were convicted of violating the rules for staging an unauthorized demonstration and were given suspended sentences.
Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny has told the Moscow City Court that police are trying to silence him ahead of next month’s mayoral election.
Navalny said on Tuesday that his campaign offices were being shut down in violation of a court ruling allowing them to remain open until the vote on September 8.
Navalny also said the police were blocking attempts by people to join his campaign.
The Moscow City Court ordered the campaign offices closed in August in a ruling that was widely criticized as politically motivated.
Navalny and other opposition activists plan to hold unauthorized demonstrations in Moscow on September 8.
The demonstrations are likely to be the biggest street protests since the opposition’s anti-Putin rallies in late 2011 and early 2012.

"In 2013, U.S. crude oil exports to Canada for February were up 75 percent from January to 3.4 million barrels. Canada relies on the United States for its crude oil supply. Crude oil exports from the United States to Canada are down slightly from last year, however.
On January 27, the Obama Administration announced a 90-day review of the application for the Keystone XL pipeline. On February 22, the State Department released a draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS). The draft EIS shows that the pipeline would create a net benefit to the United States, according to the Administration. This is a departure from the Administration’s position of 2011, when the application was denied.
TransCanada, the company proposing the pipeline, has been trying to build the Keystone XL for eight years. It has applied for the pipeline nine times, and the most recent application was approved by the U.S. State Department in January 2012.
The pipeline would transport oil from Alberta, Canada to Steele City, Nebraska. From there, the oil would travel through the U.S. Midwest to an existing pipeline system in Texas.

"In 2013, North Korea would lose tens of millions of dollars a year if it closes the Kaesong industrial complex. The eight-year-old factory complex that Pyongyang jointly operates with South Korea is the last remaining direct economic tie between the two Koreas. In the past, the North would have been forced to close the complex. This time, North Korea seems to have decided that it cannot afford to.
South Korean media has reported that North Korea’s official Korean Central News Agency said it would close the factory complex if the South Korean government fails to provide it with electricity and heat at the complex. The North said the reason behind its decision is that South Korea has refused to pay $70 million to the North Korean government. The amount is owed to Pyongyang for electricity and heat supplied at the Kaesong complex.
Since Kaesong opened in 2004, it has served as a showcase for the North’s ability to collaborate with South Korea. North Korean workers have been paid $140 a month and the South Koreans in charge have reported no difficulties in communication. North Korea has earned tens of millions of dollars in profits from the complex. But that is not the main point of the issue.

The report finds that the Iranian regime has systematically worked to restrict religious freedom for the past 13 years. In 2000, then-president Khatami issued a 10-year plan for the improvement of the country’s human rights, but to date, “the Islamic Republic has failed to honor its commitment to the rule of law and religious freedom for all of its citizens.” The Commission noted that the current regime, led by Ahmadinejad, is “even more determined to suppress all aspects of religion that do not conform to the religious dogma of the Iranian government.” The Commission’s report notes the regime’s crackdown on religious minority groups, especially Sufi Muslims and Baha’is.

The system, developed by Israeli and U.S. defense firms, was built to protect Israel’s civilian population against rocket and missile attacks.
The missile defense system was built on a system developed by the U.S. Missile Defense Agency in the 1990s to protect Washington D.C. and surrounding cities. The Iron Dome was designed to shoot down small missiles and artillery shells, not rockets fired from the other side of the world.
The technology used to detect and intercept these projectiles is highly classified and the program’s exact cost is secret. But Israeli defense officials have said it was built with U.S. tax dollars and cost tens of millions of dollars.

She would break in the fifth game of the second set, as she was finally able to put away the Li forehand, which has plagued her all year. She would go on to win 12 straight games in the second set and eventually win the title.

While many British conservatives look back fondly on her time in office, it’s a different story in Canada. For Canadians who remember the 1980s, Margaret Thatcher’s leadership in Britain, which ran from 1979 to 1990, was a polarizing period in Canadian politics.

"In 2013, Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) lawmakers yesterday accused the Taipei City Police Department of malfeasance for allowing a Chinese businessman with government ties to leave Taiwan after he allegedly sexually assaulted a woman. 
The accusations followed a court ruling that the police did not fulfill their duty to protect the woman from the assault, which occurred in April last year in an upscale Taipei hotel.
The DPP lawmakers said that they had previously petitioned the police for details of the man's case, but that they received only vague answers. 
""The Taipei City Police Department is acting very strangely,"" DPP Legislator Lin Hung-chi said at a press conference. 
Lin said that the department was reluctant to reveal details about the man's case because of a ""secret deal"" made between the city police and the Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT).
He said that during a meeting in February 2013, the police and the KMT signed a contract that would allow KMT-affiliated Chinese businessmen to go on a ""tour"" of Taiwan without needing to file a travel plan, as required by law.

Musharraf is serving a four-year jail sentence on charges of high treason. He has spent most of his time in self-exile in Dubai, since fleeing to London in 2016. He was due to return to Pakistan to complete his sentence in March, but the Islamabad High Court blocked his return last month. In his ruling, the court found that Musharraf's arrest had been ""illegal"" as it was based on ""inadequate evidence"". It ordered the state to pay Musharraf 20 million Pakistani rupees (around 165,000) in damages. Musharraf, who ruled Pakistan from 1999 to 2008, has had his conviction challenged in the Supreme Court, which is yet to deliver its verdict.

The 87-year old politician, a respected mediator, secured the needed 504 votes in the parliament. The re-election comes just months after the previous President Giorgio Napolitano stepped down.
In February 2013, Napolitano had decided to retire after serving for more than a decade.

"In 2013, Dennis DeMartin, 69, is expected to answer a judge's questions after being accused of juror misconduct by Goodman's defense team. The hearing could help decide whether John Goodman is granted a new trial. Goodman's retrial is expected to begin in October.
DeMartin, who was on the jury that convicted Goodman in 2012, has been charged with violating Florida law that bars judges from appointing potential jurors if they have been paid for their time on a jury.
DeMartin, who is a part-time Florida Bar lawyer, had been selected to serve on Goodman's jury in his first trial. He was not selected to serve on the second jury in 2014, however.
DeMartin was paid $3,000 to be on the first jury in the 2012 trial, according to court records. He was paid $2,500 to be on the second jury in 2014.
DeMartin, who declined to comment on the matter when reached by phone, told The Palm Beach Post in an email that he was being ""harassed and attacked by the prosecution and their lawyer.""

Just 10 micrometers in diameter, the needlelike spicule from the sea squirt Herdmania momus helped researchers in Israel and Wisconsin unlock the crystal structure of vaterite. In this nanoscale needle, the calcium carbonate crystals have been arranged into helical double chains, a first for any naturally occurring calcium carbonate. By analyzing these helices in the context of a large vaterite crystal, they have also helped to explain why vaterite’s crystals are often so bizarrely shaped. For example, the vaterite in the fossilized shells of some early arthropods, such as trilobites, were actually formed by helical chains of vaterite, the researchers have concluded. This work is published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

If it's not small, Moscow residents are likely to complain that it's too high. But authorities are hoping that the move will reduce the number of illegally parked cars and curb congestion on the city's streets.
Experts said the move is long overdue, but may prove controversial.
""There's no denying that the move is overdue. The practice of towing cars that are illegally parked has been around for quite a while, but the city has never collected fees for towing,"" said Valery Tsekhansky, head of the Transport Policy Center at the Russian Public Policy Institute.
""Currently, drivers of illegally parked cars are only fined. The city is still able to collect money from these fines. But in order to be able to cover the costs of towing, which are significant, the city must charge motorists.""

The European Commission wanted the airlines to keep the data for at least two years. The European Union was to pay the airlines to keep these records.
After this defeat, the European Commission re-introduced the bill in 2014, again with the idea of paying the airlines to store the data. But this time the European Parliament wanted the data to be deleted. The airline industry could not agree and the bill was thrown out by 26 votes to 22. However, the Parliament did say the airlines should keep the data and give it to the EU. The EU could then keep the data if it wished. The airlines could still keep the data as long as it was for commercial purposes. But the airlines were allowed to delete the data if it was for commercial purposes. They could also delete the data if it was for non-commercial purposes, or if the data was more than six months old.

"In 2013, Renewed attacks on island airport roll back the clock - The Globe and Mail. Porter Airlines announced it would ask for permission to extend a runway at Billy Bishop Toronto City Airport. But the Toronto Airport Authority, which manages the island airport, has balked. Here’s a quick history of the fight.
The TAA says extending the runway will require the demolition of homes and businesses, and that it would be safer to add a parallel taxiway. But airport officials are pushing back against the TAA's claim that adding a taxiway would be cheaper.
The two sides have been at loggerheads for more than a year. The TAA board is now expected to consider a proposal by TAA CEO Howard Eng that would require Porter to move its base to a bigger airport before it would grant the extension, according to people familiar with the situation.
The fight over Billy Bishop could set a precedent for other small regional airports across Canada and around the world. If the TAA prevails, other airports could decide to follow suit by blocking expansion at small airports in their regions, forcing airlines to move to larger airports with more runways.
Porter is among the world's fastest-growing airlines",-645922816.0,-650117120.0,4194304.0

(CBC) As a small Canadian dog lay dying, its owner struggled to come to terms with what had happened. “I couldn’t believe it. I thought someone was joking,” said Cindy Partridge of Nova Scotia. She had found her dog, a two-year-old, eight-pound pomeranian named Bailey, with a hole in his head. The bullet had gone through him and then lodged itself inside a tree. The bullet had pierced the dog’s skull, but didn’t cause a large wound, which is why the owner thought at first that it might not have been serious. “He’s got a small hole in his head. He doesn’t have a big gaping wound. It’s a small hole in his head.” Partridge’s dog had been shot by a stray bullet. “The dog was shot in the head, in the back of his head.

It is in this context that I say to the British public that we need a radical and immediate rethink of the government's approach to this issue. I would like to see the government do what it did when it created the NHS: commission a comprehensive review of the health system from a group of experts. They should be asked to look at the whole of the system, not just at the NHS.
Let's not waste money and resources and take the NHS for granted. Let's have the debate and invest in it, so that it can play a bigger part in our social fabric and help build a society that has the best healthcare in the world.
I know the NHS is a very complex system, with 1.3 million staff and 30 million people using it each year. But we can take advantage of the experience of other countries and make sure we learn from mistakes elsewhere, rather than repeat them.
