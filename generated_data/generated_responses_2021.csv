In 2019, the total primary energy supply (TPES) in the EU increased 0.9%, largely due to an increase in natural gas. This is a reversal of the downward trend seen for a decade after the 2008/09 financial crisis. Renewable energy generation in the EU in 2019 increased by 12.7% to 2,018 TWh (TWh = 1,000,000 MWh) or 19% of the total primary energy supply.

In the last 20 years there has been a growing recognition of the need for housing and service provision that specifically targets women experiencing homelessness.
While it’s clear that the majority of homelessness is experienced by men, women have distinct and different experiences of homelessness. The nature of homelessness for women is not always visible and may be difficult to detect, but is prevalent, with women comprising approximately 30 per cent of all people experiencing homelessness in Australia.
This is especially true for older women. As we age, the number of women experiencing homelessness increases. A report commissioned by the NSW Government revealed that the proportion of homeless people aged over 50 had increased 70 per cent since 2003. As well, one in four women aged 60 and over who experience homelessness is aged over 75.
Housing for older women experiencing homelessness is an area where there is significant need and there is no national model of supported housing"," women

russia cracks down on human rights groups
The Moscow Times reports that in the past week Russian authorities have taken further action to curtail independent human rights organisations, such as the Memorial and the Golos election monitoring groups. 
On 20 December, the Russian parliament's upper house voted to strip Memorial of its non-profit status, which effectively means it will no longer be eligible for state funding and cannot take donations. Memorial's lawyer Alexey Shlyakhto says that in order to keep its legal status the organisation must apply for a new non-profit status, which is likely to be rejected. 
The Memorial organisation is a network of human rights defenders that has been documenting and researching the crimes of the Soviet Union and other repressive regimes, including Nazi Germany, and promoting remembrance of the victims. Its work has earned it international awards and the respect of many Russian and international human rights organisations.

A 30 year study in the south-west shows that fire benefits Christmas bells. The flowers grow in high populations in burnt areas, and these are then less likely to be eaten by mice.
This is a large part of the reason why fire is important for native animals in south-west Australia.
The study was carried out by Dr Tom Pulsford, from UWA's Centre for Wildlife Genetics, and his colleague Dr Jodie Laffan from Curtin University. Their research was funded by the Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions and was published in the journal Biological Conservation.
Christmas bells are a large, showy and highly distinctive native flower of the south-west, and a popular local plant. The flower attracts pollinators including birds and honeyeaters, and they are also a major food source for the local fauna.

12 May 2021 - chalmers says budget was missed opportunity for working people
Australian Workers’ Union (AWU) federal secretary Daniel Walton says the federal government has missed a chance to lift the living standards of working people in today’s budget.
“The budget was a missed opportunity. It should have used the opportunity to take action on working people’s priorities like wage growth, affordable child care, mental health, and the cost of living.
“By not doing this, the budget is now failing to take any action to tackle the cost of living for working people and their families. This is a real loss, with many families living in poverty, and the cost of living skyrocketing.
“The government needs to step up to the mark and take action to ensure the cost of living doesn’t rise any further.
“The Australian Workers’ Union is calling on the government to use the economic outlook and growth from the pandemic to finally take real action on workers’ rights and to tackle the cost of living.

Israelis, and visitors to the country, can be assured of a rapid response to Covid-19 thanks to the country’s vaccination programme.
More than 15% of the Israeli population is already fully vaccinated and over half has received at least one dose.
The UK is a long way behind with only 1.8% of the population vaccinated, according to the latest government figures.
However, in terms of speed, the UK is catching up, thanks to the huge ramp up in its vaccination programme.
It is now expected to reach 14 million doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, by mid-March, having only given out 4.8 million at the beginning of January.
And the pace of vaccination is likely to accelerate over the next few months.
However, the UK and Israel are also facing significant challenges, with public confidence in the vaccines.
Israel is currently reporting a very low rate of cases. However, there are still concerns about the effectiveness of the vaccines.

In other words, I thought he would use the electoral process as an excuse to launch a violent, armed takeover of the U.S. government, in which he would be the leader. I was wrong. In January 2021, the Republicans were unable to convince a few thousand extremists to storm the Capitol, to overthrow the U.S. government.
I also expected that the Republicans would turn their anger at the election loss into a populist pitch that would resonate in the 2022 midterms and allow the party to regain power. This, too, is not happening. As I write this, the","?

“I’ve been pushing this for a long time for us to have a quarantine facility at home, so if a ship is going to come into a quarantine facility at home, we have the capacity to get rid of the virus, rather than have it sitting in a hotel somewhere overseas.

the importance of learning cpr techniques and,06 July 2021,"06 July 2021 - the importance of learning cpr techniques and skills is now more evident than ever before, with the coronavirus pandemic continuing to have a huge impact on our health and our communities.
CPR stands for cardiopulmonary resuscitation. It is an emergency first aid technique designed to provide the artificial support to the heart and lungs of a patient who is experiencing cardiac arrest, meaning they are in cardiac arrest. 
CPR is often performed in combination with defibrillation, or the use of an automated external defibrillator. The AED is a life-saving device used to diagnose the type of cardiac arrest a patient is experiencing, and then treat it. 
Cardiac arrest occurs when the heart suddenly and unexpectedly stops beating. This causes a lack of oxygen to be delivered to the brain and other vital organs. The consequences of a cardiac arrest can be severe, with a patient dying if CPR and defibrillation is not performed as soon as possible. This is why CPR training is so important.

Blood Bikes Transport Blood and Covid 19 Tests to Help Save Lives
For many years now, the blood bike volunteers have been a great support to the hospital with many other charitable events.  However, since Covid, they have been on the front line, transporting blood and other items urgently for hospitals across the UK. 
On 20th November 2020, the blood bike team in the Midlands was requested to deliver some 5000 Covid 19 tests to a medical centre at the edge of a major city. 
This was a high priority for the centre and needed to be completed urgently.  As soon as they received the request, the blood bike team made arrangements to have the blood and tests on a pallet delivered to their depot where the bike team met the driver.  A full check was carried out, confirming that all the items were correct and ready for loading onto the bike.  Then the bike team made the 100 mile journey to the destination.

The closure of the long-running bid to establish a new oil refinery in Australia risks the long-term supply and security of domestic fuels for millions of motorists.
The Queensland Government has confirmed the planned $6 billion refinery at Yambanto will not proceed after failing to meet requirements for securing the necessary investment finance.
This comes less than a month after the Federal Government ruled out subsidising the project as part of the government's $1.5 billion investment fund, which has already paid for the mothballed Darwin LNG plant to be re-opened. The new Australian government has also abandoned the proposed A$10 billion hydrogen hub on the north-east coast of Western Australia, as well as the $2 billion coal-fired power plant proposed in Queensland.

A mother has asked for a vaccination dose of a coronavirus vaccine, but received a wrong dose, reports from the newspaper 'De Telegraaf'. The woman received the first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine last week. A few days later, she wanted to receive a second dose. That dose was in error, the newspaper reports.
The vaccination staff then corrected the mistake. The woman had a double dose, as she received both first doses, she is told. She did not get ill after the vaccination, she was also not ill afterwards, but it was clear that she had received a double dose.
The woman said she was very happy that the vaccination staff had corrected the mistake. She did not want to be vaccinated with the second dose, as she felt she was already immune.

The NSW Government have released a consultation paper for public feedback regarding the removal of the floodplain harvesting license from the Gwydir River and part of the Castlereagh River, with a view to repealing the existing harvesting license.
We believe this is a backward step and is a risk to the viability of many small operators who have been in the area for many years. The paper notes:
“The NSW Government is committed to protecting floodplains for the long-term environmental, social, and economic benefits that they provide. The Government does not support the extraction of water from floodplains to supply the private sector. Floodplains have many other uses, including for recreation, conservation, and for native flora and fauna that relies on them. The Government is committed to ensuring that future development of water resources in NSW is in harmony with the environment, and that water is allocated equitably, for the long-term benefit of the community.”

The definition of disability is broad and includes physical and mental impairment which has a substantial and long-term effect on a person’s ability to carry out normal day-to-day activities.  The definition does not apply to a person’s disability if they can show that it was brought on by their lifestyle choices.  An example of this would be an employee who suffered from diabetes because of an unhealthy diet, but the definition of disability will not apply in these circumstances.

The story was about a teenager named Nina who is sent to an academy for young magicians. I wasn’t sure what to think of it at first because it was quite a slow start. I was glad that it was slow though because it allowed me to enjoy the first couple of chapters without worrying about the story moving too fast. I also enjoyed the characters in the book because they had their own personalities and the relationships between them were very relatable.
The story was well-written and I enjoyed it because of the many different elements that it contained. I really liked the setting and the characters were interesting to read about.

A recent study conducted by Professor Anthony Larmour and his team has shed light on how we may be able to better protect the Great Barrier Reef in the future.
This has been achieved through a study that analysed water column data from 10 locations around the reef.
“This study is the first to use this type of data to look at the relationship between nitrogen in surface water and harmful algal blooms, which is a significant challenge for the reef ecosystem,” Professor Larmour said.
The results of this study, published in the journal Marine Pollution Bulletin, have highlighted that nitrogen in surface waters is a strong predictor of harmful algal blooms in the Great Barrier Reef. They also showed that algal bloom conditions on the reef are more likely to occur under conditions of higher nitrogen.
Nitrogen is a key nutrient for algal growth and its high concentrations in surface waters are detrimental to the reef, as it inhibits the growth of corals and algae that provide the reef with habitat.

Victoria's border closure has hit hard on the Murray Valley town of Corowa, which has seen a reduction of more than 30 per cent of visitor numbers compared to the same time last year. 
In the absence of visitors, the tourism sector in the town has been forced to rethink how it can best survive the crisis.
Many businesses in the region rely heavily on tourism, with accommodation providers saying the lack of tourists is impacting their bottom line.
In 2018 the region recorded a 21 per cent increase in tourism spending.
The Victorian border closure has led to a drastic decrease in visitors with some accommodation providers saying the lack of tourists has left them struggling to survive.

New South Wales researchers are studying how masks protect against bushfire smoke
Scientists at the University of Sydney’s Charles Perkins Centre have launched a trial study into how masks protect against bushfire smoke, as communities are urged to stay indoors during the hot weather.
Lead researcher Dr Michelle Wong said the study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of masks on bushfire smoke.
“We have conducted preliminary studies and found that a variety of masks, including N95 masks, surgical masks, and even masks worn by runners and cyclists, are more effective at filtering out smoke particles than a simple bandanna or scarf,” she said.
“However, further studies need to be done to test the most effective type of mask, depending on the situation.”
Dr Wong said masks can provide a layer of protection, but may not be enough for people with respiratory conditions.
“We are recommending that people who suffer from asthma and other respiratory conditions should stay indoors and away from any smoke or air pollution,” she said.

Piglets in the making – The future is bright for pig farming
If you were to visit a farm in the West of Ireland where a number of pig breeders are operating, you’d see miniature piglets running around. Some people may think they are cute, but for the pig breeders, they are very useful. In a market where prices are down, and many people are losing their livelihoods, these miniature pigs could be the solution. 
In Ireland there is a pig shortage. There are many pig farmers who are finding it increasingly difficult to find pigs. In 2020 the number of pig farms dropped by 10 per cent. 
The Irish pig industry is highly dependent on imports and exports. It’s estimated that we need 80,000 pigs to supply the market. At the moment, we only have about 60,000. 
The decline in the number of pig farms can be partly attributed to the Covid pandemic. In the summer of 2020"," pigs

The volunteers, who are all part of the National Trust’s Heritage Skills Programme, have been working to restore the pump for the past year.
The pump is thought to be over 250 years old and was originally brought to the house as a working feature but is now in a derelict state.

Agricultural workers are struggling with the increasing difficulty in finding the right staff at the right time, which is leading to a shortage of people in the field, according to a survey by the National Farmers’ Union.
The NFU is warning that many farmers are struggling to get enough labour, with some having to turn away business for the first time in 30 years because they cannot recruit the staff they need. A poll conducted by the NFU of its 5,000 members showed 86 per cent were struggling to get enough staff in the field, 60 per cent said that they had reduced their production as a result and more than 50 per cent said they had had to turn away business for the first time in 30 years.
One of the main problems is the difficulty in recruiting seasonal workers, with the shortage of people in the field, especially in the summer, affecting fruit, vegetable and potato growers, and dairy, arable, pig and poultry farmers.","

Scott Morrison will meet French President Emmanuel Macron for the first time as head of government on Wednesday, in what is likely to be the first of several encounters during his first year in office.
The meeting is likely to be a test of the strength of the French-Australian relationship following a bitter period of diplomatic rowing after France launched a major submarine contract with a rival to Australia’s bid to supply submarines, in a move which was slammed by the Morrison government as “unacceptable” and “betrayal”.
A statement from Mr Morrison’s office said the two leaders would meet for a bilateral summit “to discuss a wide range of issues of mutual interest including trade and investment”.
“The Prime Minister will raise with President Macron Australia’s concerns about the security threat posed by China,” it said.
“The Australian Government continues to raise its concerns with China and China’s coercive activities, including in relation to Australia’s national security.”

We are all aware of the risk of contracting Covid-19 when travelling overseas, but have you considered what you would do if you did catch the virus? Would you be able to get home? Would you be treated at the local hospital or would you have to fly home to see a specialist? Would you need to be quarantined when you get back to Australia? These are just some of the things you need to consider when thinking about travelling overseas.
If you have already booked a trip and have purchased travel insurance, you will know that you can make a claim if you are stranded abroad and need to get home. However, if you are travelling with your family, you may also need to make claims for them. If you are travelling without family, you may also have to pay for your accommodation while waiting to fly home. When choosing your travel insurance, think about how much you will need to cover and whether your policy will allow for your trip to be delayed or cancelled due to illness.","

Mr Dutton was forced to defend the government’s handling of the submarine deal after the Australian Financial Review (AFR) reported on Wednesday that France had sent a letter to Australia outlining its disappointment over the decision to terminate the submarine contract and the impact on its national security.

But it has also been found to be harmful to bees and beekeepers.

The UK pet industry had its best year on record in 2020, with consumer spending surging to a record high of more than £6.7 billion, the Pet Industry Federation has reported.

In particular, pet food and treats saw the biggest growth in sales, which is the first time the pet food category has exceeded £1 billion.
Sales of pet food and treats are now worth £1.14 billion compared to £1.02 billion in 2019 and £0.96 billion in 2018.

Six year old triplets braved the shave by the beard community at the World’s Greatest Shave 2021.
When six year old triplets, Jack, Joe and Oliver were told about World’s Greatest Shave, they were determined to raise money for leukaemia research.
All three boys were born prematurely at 27 weeks and their mum, Stephanie, was told her triplet boys had a rare condition called Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome. The boys needed to undergo multiple operations to survive.
Stephanie decided to shave her head in solidarity and to inspire the boys to be brave for the shave, so she shaved all her hair off before her boys’ birthdays. The boys saw this and were inspired to be brave too.
Stephanie was so inspired by the World’s Greatest Shave and her boys that she registered to do the shave again for her boys. The triplets loved having their mums’ head shaved and so Stephanie asked her friends to join her in the shave.","

And we also know that we have got international visitors who have the potential to come here and have to have a vaccination passport. We would like to have a vaccine passport in place in Australia so we can open up our international borders and we can have certainty around that. And so we are really encouraging people to have those vaccinations as soon as possible. They are safe. They are effective.”
In another sign of the vaccine’s effectiveness, a large study of more than 30 million people has shown that the vaccines are more than 94 per cent effective"
china us tensions warship sails taiwan strait,05 February 2021,"05 February 2021 - china us tensions warship sails taiwan strait
Taiwan’s defense minister said Friday that his country’s navy had scrambled fighter jets to intercept a Chinese warship sailing through the Taiwan Strait.
In a statement, the defense ministry said that China’s Jin Guang was “in close contact with the Taiwan coast guard” on Thursday. It said that the Chinese vessel entered the strait through the southwestern Miyako Strait, then turned north to cross through the Bashi Channel, a stretch of sea separating Taiwan from the Philippines.
Taiwan’s Air Force sent fighters to intercept the ship, according to the ministry. Taiwan’s defense ministry said that the flight of Taiwan’s jets “caused a few tense moments, but the Chinese warship left without entering Taiwan’s territorial air defense zone.”
China has sent warships through the strait on multiple occasions in recent years. Chinese ships are typically in international waters when they sail through the Taiwan Strait. The US and other Western countries generally refrain from taking part in military activities near Taiwan, but they sometimes send warships","

The Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine rollout for Australians continues this week, but some state and territory health ministers have indicated that their regions will not be administering the second dose immediately after the first.
Victoria, NSW, and Queensland are among those planning to stagger the second dose of the Pfizer jab, citing concerns about supply, according to reports.
The Pfizer jab is a two-dose vaccine, but it’s not clear yet whether the second dose will be administered at the same site as the first, or if there will be a break between the two.
Australian government guidelines say the second dose should be administered within 21 to 28 days of the first dose, but it’s not clear how that recommendation might be implemented.

As the new law which makes Birmingham the first city in the UK to be granted ‘city status’ is put into practice, Birmingham City Council has also granted ‘City Status’ to the natural justice principle.
The natural justice principle is that people must have the right to be heard and to have their say during the making of important decisions that affect their lives and their communities.
It means that the Council must explain to the people involved why a decision has been made, the arguments for and against the decision, and what happens next.
This will apply to the decisions made by the council in the way that it spends taxpayers’ money, but it will also apply to any other decisions that the council makes about how it manages public services.
Birmingham City Council has also agreed to do everything that it can to ensure that people who can’t attend meetings in person can still be involved. That might include having a face-to-face meeting, a video link, or other ways of being involved.

Taiwan’s Defence Ministry earlier this week thanked the US for the latest arms sale, saying they would help Taiwan maintain its security. US President Joe Biden in his first call with Taiwanese leader Tsai Ing-wen said Washington would continue to support Taiwan as it faces growing threats from China.

donald trump parts impeachment lawyers week before trial,31 January 2021,"31 January 2021 - donald trump parts impeachment lawyers week before trial
The 14th Amendment to the Constitution provides that a person who takes an oath to support the Constitution and then “engages in insurrection or rebellion” is ineligible for federal office. But how exactly do you prove such conduct?
That question has occupied lawyers for both sides of the Jan. 6 insurrection as they prepare for Trump’s impeachment trial. Trump’s defense team is seeking to portray him as the victim of a “politically motivated” impeachment, while the prosecution is arguing that he must be convicted on the grounds that he incited an insurrection against the government and therefore engaged in insurrection.
In a new report published Wednesday, the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, or CRS, provided a detailed analysis of the question of how to prove Trump’s impeachment.
The CRS said that courts have considered several factors in the past in making these determinations.
First, a person’s “voluntary conduct” must be determined. For example, in 1877, a judge found that","

Gippsland has seen a significant rental shortage in recent years, prompting one local family to make the difficult decision to move their family interstate.
Brendon and Rebecca Bremner made the big decision to move their family to Western Australia earlier this year, and it wasn’t an easy decision to make.
They have two children, both in high school, and after a few months searching for suitable rental accommodation in Gippsland, they decided to take the leap.
Brendon says the experience made him realise just how important the rental sector is to the local community.
“It was just a huge process,” he said. “I’d never experienced anything like it before.
“My wife and I both work full-time. There was no way we were going to be able to afford to have two people living in our house while we looked for something, so it really became a race against the clock.

On July 27, 2021, former inmates of the Don Dale Detention Centre in Darwin, Northern Territory, won a landmark legal settlement in Australia. This was a victory for survivors of abuse in the Don Dale youth detention centre, a place of detention notorious for its use of force and inhuman conditions. The settlement, worth over $20 million, was achieved through the filing of a class action lawsuit by a group of survivors and their families.
The settlement came after a decade-long struggle by survivors to obtain compensation and acknowledgement for the mistreatment they suffered while incarcerated at the centre. The lawsuit was filed in the Federal Court in 2012, seeking compensation for the physical and psychological harm experienced by survivors. The settlement includes a payment to each survivor of $50,000, as well as funding for the establishment of a dedicated support fund.
The settlement also includes a number of other measures aimed at addressing the impact of the abuse on survivors, including the establishment of a"," action settlement in canada

The federal government will invest $2.1 million in a 12-month recovery plan to help small towns across north-west Queensland hit by this year’s devastating floods.
The money will go to the Queensland Government’s Flood Recovery Taskforce, which has already identified $150 million in state government support.
The money will go to more than 20 communities, including Ayr, Burdekin, Cardwell, Charters Towers, Ingham, Home Hill, Inglewood, Julia Creek, Mount Isa, Normanton, Richmond, Thuringowa, Tully and Townsville.
Federal Agriculture Minister David Littleproud said the support would assist the recovery of the community’s livelihoods.

Manning river opening
The National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) have begun to open up a number of areas on the Manning river, including a large area of coastal heath in front of Cape Hawke and the lower portion of the mangrove forest.
These changes to the river's ecology have already had a devastating impact on our little shaggy-thighed robin population. It has been nearly a year since the birds last nested and it appears that this year's pair of birds will not be nesting at the same spot. They are currently at a loss of where to build their nest.
Mangroves, coastal heath and open water are essential habitat for the little shaggy-thighed robin, and the loss of these habitats has a knock-on effect for other birds such as the spotted bowerbird, grey goshawk, swamp harrier, Australian king parrot, red-rumped parrot and white-breasted woodswallow.

In a briefing on Friday, Chris Whitty, England’s chief medical officer, and Patrick Vallance, the government’s chief scientific adviser, said the government had commissioned research on the omicron variant to better understand how dangerous it is.
Whitty said the team would be working with scientists in South Africa to find out what the risk of infection was for those who had already had the virus and what was known about the transmissibility of the new variant.
He added that there was “no reason to think it would be different” from previous variants of the virus, saying it could be more transmissible than the Delta variant. “But, you know, that is our job at the moment, to work out whether that is the case,” Whitty said.

""Today is a good day,"" Ms Berejiklian says.
""That means those who've been fully vaccinated, and their essential workers can be confident in being able to travel to our beautiful regions.""

Ministers argued that the measure would have prevented the circulation of offensive content online, by obliging firms to vet what they publish.

aussie company fights for survival against us competition - but why?
I was reading an article on the internet that an Australian company has filed for voluntary administration (aka liquidation) because it can’t compete with foreign companies.
Well, that’s a surprise, not! As a matter of fact, it was an Aussie company that was a leader in its field, but was then bought out by a large US multinational.
This is the way it usually works – an Australian company comes up with something new and innovative. Then the multinational swoops in and takes it over.
The Aussie company’s management team is then laid off, and it’s not long before the company starts losing its innovation and goes downhill.
That’s what’s happening to Australian manufacturing. It was the innovation of Australian companies that helped build our country into the powerhouse it once was, but now they’re being gobbled up by the multinational giants.

The campaign was designed to target groups who are most at risk from the virus, namely the elderly and those living in aged care facilities. However, the rollout of the vaccination program was mired in bureaucratic red tape, with the government first seeking approval from the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) to authorise the use of the Pfizer vaccine in Australians aged 16 years and over.

The Police Association and its national president Chris Cahill said the public needed to know what is going on in their neighbourhood.
""Consent and crime is a critical part of crime prevention. But I do understand that when someone says you've got to consent an app, it might have a bit of resistance,"" he said.
""We're not asking the public to consent the app, we're just asking the public to download the app, and have that downloaded, and get in touch with the police.
""I think it's something that we all have to do in our communities. We all have to know what's going on.""
The association also revealed 11 police officers from across the state were in self-isolation after testing positive to COVID-19.

couple say hemp house fireproof termite proof and good value,09 February 2021,"09 February 2021 - couple say hemp house fireproof termite proof and good value for money
When you need a fireproof home or to termite-proof your house, you can't do better than Hempcrete.
In this article, we will show you how to make a fireproof house using hemp.
First, we need to know about the material.
Hemp is a natural, renewable and environmentally friendly plant. Hemp grows well in most soil types, even in poor soils. The plants grow up to six feet tall and can be harvested multiple times during the growing season. The plants can also be used for food, paper, fiber, oil, and animal feed. Hempcrete is a natural material made from the fibers of the hemp plant. The material is used to create walls, roofs, and floors.
To make hempcrete, the hemp fibers are mixed with a binding agent such as lime, gypsum, or Portland cement. The mixture is then poured into forms and allowed to cure. The cured material is strong, lightweight, and fireproof.

Cambodia: Sam Rainsy’s 25-year prison sentence is ‘a gross violation of human rights’
A Cambodian court today sentenced Sam Rainsy, the leader of the country’s opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party, to 25 years in jail on the basis of a politically motivated conviction for “incitement”.
Rainsy, who was absent from the trial and the sentencing, has been under house arrest since September 2015 when he returned to the country.
The court in Phnom Penh has found that he committed treason, incitement and forgery, according to a judgement issued today.
“We are disappointed by this sentence which is clearly politically motivated and which has no basis in fact,” said Rupert Abbott, Amnesty International’s Deputy Regional Director for Research.
“This verdict will only exacerbate tensions in Cambodia, which are at an unprecedented high. The authorities must immediately release Sam Rainsy from house arrest and drop all charges against him.”

New research by the Royal College of Psychiatrists and the Mental Health Foundation, has found that a majority of mental health professionals back a new coercive control law in England and Wales.
The research found that 77 per cent of psychiatrists supported the introduction of a new coercive control law. 58 per cent of mental health nurses and 54 per cent of psychologists supported it.
Mental health professionals were asked if they thought a new coercive control law was necessary to protect people experiencing mental illness from coercive behaviour. They were also asked what should be included in this new law, which the Government is currently considering. Their responses are:
‘It is a shame that there are people who are not yet aware that coercive control exists. Many psychiatrists who have seen cases of coercive control know the damage it can do.’
‘The only way to make this law effective is to introduce the necessary education for doctors and lawyers.’

first nations health services at the brink
The health of First Nations people is in crisis, according to the CEO of the National Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisation (NACCHO).
NACCHO CEO Pat Turner told the Senate on Thursday that COVID-19 and the Delta strain was hitting Indigenous communities hard, with a recent survey of NACCHO member organisations finding a “dramatic and concerning decline” in access to services in recent months.
Turner said the survey showed that “only 23% of respondents reported the same levels of activity as in the period prior to COVID, 46% reported less than half the pre-COVID levels of activity, and 30% reported less than 10% of pre-COVID levels of activity”.
Turner also told the Senate that 25% of Indigenous people were being treated by remote telehealth services, a figure she said was “far higher than the 10% average of other Australians”.

The educators have expressed their concerns that the Education Ministry's approach to the pandemic will be ineffective and ultimately harmful to the country's students.
""Based on the Ministry's response to date, there is nothing in the plans to provide the assurance that students will be safe in schools.

Graham Creed is an atmospheric scientist and senior lecturer at the School of Environment, Science and Engineering, at Southern Cross University in Lismore.
It's been a wild week, with a combination of a powerful low and the jet stream delivering big swings in the weather, and this will continue. The weather looks to be set up for more wild, changeable, and at times extreme conditions.
The combination of the low and jet stream is a common one. When this combination comes together, the air mass over eastern Australia is forced to the east over the ocean, and the jet stream moves over eastern Australia, carrying cold polar air into eastern Australia. 
What this means is that when the cold polar air comes in, it's usually very cold and brings very dry conditions. The polar air will often come in with strong winds and some rain. When the polar air gets near the coast, it's likely to get cold and bring rain, sometimes heavy rain.

Donald Trump's second impeachment trial will begin early February. Senate leaders have set aside the first two weeks of February for the trial, but it's not clear whether the Senate will be in session at the time. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has suggested he may vote to convict the former president but has not said when. There is speculation he will vote in February, but the trial could stretch beyond. The second impeachment trial would be the first of a president who is no longer in office. Trump was impeached by the House of Representatives last month, with Democrats accusing him of inciting the deadly Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol. That trial was held in a joint session of the Senate and the House, making it the first impeachment trial to be held in the Senate.","

new covid 19 modelling will be discussed by,22 December 2021,"22 December 2021 - new covid 19 modelling will be discussed by the WHO SAGE
The WHO SAGE group will discuss the new covid 19 modelling on 22 December 2021.
The group will discuss the new modeling from the UK government that the risk of hospitalisation due to the Omicron variant is 70% lower than the Delta variant. This would mean that the new variant is 20% less dangerous than the previous variant. The WHO SAGE group has been asked to assess the new information on the Omicron variant.
Modelling by Imperial College in the UK says that the risk of hospitalization is 70% lower than the Delta variant. If this information is correct, then Omicron is 20% less dangerous than the Delta variant. If the 70% reduction in hospitalization risk is accurate, it means that the Omicron variant is only 20% more transmissible than the Delta variant.
Modelling of the new variant shows a risk of hospitalization of 1.5% in South Africa,"," the WHO SAGE

wa government ban quarantine security guards from second jobs,08 February 2021,"08 February 2021 - wa government ban quarantine security guards from second jobs
The WA Government has imposed a ban on security guards working at quarantine facilities being able to work elsewhere.
The move is to ensure the health and safety of all workers who interact with people in quarantine.
Premier Mark McGowan said the restrictions on the use of the facility guards were necessary to prevent an outbreak.
“The guards that work at the quarantine facilities are a very specific set of workers and they have to have the skills to deal with the risk of potential outbreak in those facilities,” Mr McGowan said.
“So we’re going to try to restrict that, so the people that are going to be doing that job are the ones that are specifically trained to do that job.”
He said the government would not restrict the movement of other security guards.
“It is important that we are able to do this, so we’re able to keep our people safe,” he told reporters.
“So we’ll have to make sure that we don’t have any restrictions on the movement of people in the facilities.”

On the same day, the President addressed the nation in a speech which was meant to be the finale of the Inauguration. However, it was interrupted by protesters who breached the building and threatened to kill members of Congress, and the Vice President, among others. Trump urged his supporters to leave the Capitol, but they did not and the President himself eventually stopped the speech.
The protesters were acting on the belief that the election was stolen and that Joe Biden had not won. Trump was trying to challenge the legitimacy of the election results, even though there were no signs of widespread election fraud.
The Capitol Police had failed to anticipate this attack and they were overwhelmed. A lack of planning and an inadequate number of officers on the scene was a huge factor in allowing this to happen.
The situation became even more tense when the crowd broke into the building and went inside, including the House and the Senate. Members of Congress, as well as Vice President Pence, were at risk"," from storming the capitol

It was with a great sense of sadness that we heard of the recent drowning at Gardner's Falls. It is a beautiful place, but it's a popular place for swimming in summer, and the warnings that should be posted there, about swimming in a gorge, aren't there.
The creek runs down a steep cliff face and then under a small waterfall. The drop into the gorge from the top of the cliff face is about 6m. At the bottom of the waterfall, the creek runs into a deep hole about 1m wide and 1.5m deep. It's difficult to know the depth of the water there.
The gorge has been known to have flash flooding, which can be life-threatening.
There's a warning sign at the bottom of the waterfall, saying that you can't swim there, but it isn't a sign that's easy to see and there's no other warning sign along the track. In the summer, the creek runs fast and is"," - please help

ACT GOVERNMENT PLANS TO INCREASE AGE OF CRIMINAL RESPONSIBILITY FROM 10 TO 14 YEARS FROM 2022
The ACT government has announced plans to increase the age of criminal responsibility from 10 to 14 years from 2022.
In an interview with the Canberra Times, Chief Minister Andrew Barr stated that the government will introduce an Act in 2022 which will allow the new age of criminal responsibility to be phased in over the next three years. Barr explained that the government is taking this step as a result of the Australian Law Reform Commission (ALRC) report which stated that a 10 year-old child is unable to understand the consequences of their actions.
The new age will be introduced gradually in three stages, with the lowest age group currently at 10 being increased to 11 in 2022. From 2023 the current age of 12 will be increased to 13 and in 202"," from 10 to 14 years from 2022

The NBL has been contacted by the Illawarra Hawks after the franchise filed for administration on Friday.
A Hawks statement, which has not been independently verified, said the move would enable it to continue operating until its debts were paid.
“Given the challenging and difficult conditions facing the organisation, it was felt that the only viable option was to appoint administrators to enable the organisation to continue to trade,” the statement read.
“It has been suggested that the club has debts totalling around $8 million, which is incorrect. The Hawks administration is in fact only $200,000 in the red at present.”
Illawarra has been contacted for comment by the NBL.
It is understood the Hawks had been trying to renegotiate a deal with the owners of the Townsville Fire, the Australian Basketball League (ABL) and the NBL to buy their franchises.
The ABL had said it would pay the Hawks $1 million, while the NBL wanted to pay $1.6 million.

Media bargaining code
Google, Facebook and Microsoft will help implement the media bargaining code if it passes through parliament in 2021, but the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission has said it is concerned that the code, as drafted, will not force the US companies to negotiate in good faith.
“While we welcome the announcements from Google, Facebook and Microsoft that they will participate in the Australian code should it pass, the ACCC remains concerned that the code may not provide adequate protections for news businesses, and that it will not compel them to negotiate in good faith,” ACCC chair Rod Sims said.
On Friday, the ACCC said it had been working with the big US tech companies on the code and had been encouraged by the level of commitment and willingness to work constructively.
However, the ACCC is still concerned about the Australian code, saying it believes the current draft may not provide a strong enough safeguard to ensure that news businesses and users have enough protections.

ghislaine maxwell trial hears final submissions,21 December 2021,"21 December 2021 - ghislaine maxwell trial hears final submissions
On 21 December, US lawyers gave their final submissions in the criminal case against Ghislaine Maxwell, who is accused of helping her late friend and British socialite Jeffrey Epstein recruit underage girls for sex acts with him in the 1990s.
On 14 December, Ghislaine Maxwell was convicted of five of the six counts of sex trafficking and sex abuse charges against her, with the jury taking just over 4 hours to reach their verdict.
Epstein killed himself in prison in 2019 while awaiting trial for similar offences.
US District Judge Alison Nathan will rule on the sentencing hearing in due course, but the 60 year-old could face up to 80 years in prison.
The jury also found Maxwell guilty of a conspiracy charge but acquitted her of another count, which concerned the sexual abuse of a minor.
Maxwell’s lawyers argued that her accusers had lied in court, while US prosecutors said her actions had harmed vulnerable women.

how australias vaccine rollout compares to other countries
The rollout of the covid-19 vaccine has been a complicated, drawn-out process, one fraught with logistical hurdles and political bickering. The government has promised to provide every Australian with at least one vaccine dose by the end of 2021, but this is still many months away.
As a reminder, Australia received 4 million doses of the astraZeneca vaccine in mid-January, with 3.8 million to be delivered by the end of March. Weve since received a further 500,000, on top of a shipment of 50,000 pfizer doses, meaning we have access to 5.5 million doses so far.

If you are a small business owner (with 15 or less employees), you do not need to take action now, as the Bill is unlikely to have a significant impact on you. 
If you are an employee, you do not need to take action now, but it’s good to be aware of what the changes may mean for you.
If you are a large business with more than 15 employees, or if you are a not-for-profit organisation or other association, the Bill is likely to impact you. You should contact your legal advisor to discuss the implications of the Bill for your business or association.

1. Afghanistan. The original reason for the Afghan adventure was to prevent the Soviets from getting into a position where they could threaten Central Europe and other NATO countries. That didn't happen, because the Soviets were very smart. They were a military superpower, and the Soviets knew what they were doing. They didn't need to take over Afghanistan. They could have kept their troops in their barracks. But, of course, if they had done that, Afghanistan would have gone over to the enemy and the Soviets would have had to have invaded Afghanistan and fought another war. It was all a trap.

the weapon reportedly reached a speed of mach 6, or six times the speed of sound, and was capable of carrying a nuclear payload. this is far in excess of the speed of the russians and chinese who are believed to be developing similar technology. the weapon was reportedly launched from a test site in the pacific ocean, although there are reports it may have been launched from an aircraft carrier.

joy symons swimming ice mile thredbo river video,28 June 2021,"28 June 2021 - joy symons swimming ice mile thredbo river video
Joy Symons is one of those people who just makes everything look so effortless. And the way she swims the length of the Thredbo River in a suit of ice is no exception.
The Australian Ice Mile record holder has already broken the Guinness World Record with the swim in 2020. But this year she returned to Thredbo in July to attempt a further distance, and we were there to capture it.
This swim was much tougher than the previous one. Joy was struggling to get her fins to grip the ice, and there were some tough moments in the water. She’s so incredibly strong that she powered through, and ultimately made it to the other side in 17.07. The world record time is 22.30.
A massive congratulations to Joy on this amazing achievement. Thank you to our production crew: Ben Wrigley, Daniel Cuthbertson, David McIvor, and Andrew Dobbie.","

The federal government has agreed to fast-track the development of a massive proposed coalmine in central Victoria, despite an opposition that has grown internationally over the practice of mining fossil fuels.
The approval will see the Victorian government spend $70 million on infrastructure for the $1.4 billion project in the Wimmera region, north of Horsham, according to the Melbourne Age.
Environmental campaigners have condemned the move and said the government was undermining Australia’s climate change targets.
The project, known as Wattle Creek, is part of the giant Acland coalmine proposal, which was put on hold in 2015 due to falling coal prices and the cost of developing the mine.
Acland was first proposed in 2008, with the government giving the project the green light in 2015.
The proposed project has been subject to a number of reviews by the Victorian government, which have been criticised for their lack of detail and transparency.

Seoul’s Housing Market Makes Australia’s Look Tame
South Korea is among the most interesting markets in the world right now, and one of the most exciting places to invest in real estate.
Last year, the country’s real estate market was a hotbed of activity, as foreign buyers from places like Japan, China, Australia and the U.S. flocked to the country’s capital cities.
However, a recent slump has many people wondering whether now is a good time to invest in South Korean real estate.
The simple answer is, yes, but only if you have the right strategy in place.
South Korea is one of the most developed countries in Asia, but it’s still struggling to make the jump from an emerging to a developed economy.
For this reason, South Korea’s real estate market is still fairly under-developed, and the country doesn’t have the same level of regulation as the U.S., Australia, or Canada.
This means that investors have the opportunity to purchase real estate","

Dear Mr. Edelman,
Thank you for your note of February 22, 2021 in which you wrote that you are “concerned” about anti-Semitism in our country.
I don’t think that I can add to your awareness of this. You have had, for example, a friend of mine in the news, a woman named Maura Healey who is the first female Attorney General of Massachusetts and a Jew.
The New York Times reported that “she is the second Jew in the United States to hold statewide elected office. She is also the highest-ranking Jewish elected official in the country.”

MeLew: “The 7,500 Jews in China, and the 7,500 more who will emigrate to Israel when this war is over, have no need of me.” A letter to Julian Edelman from Myers Leonard
Dear Mr. Edelman,
Thank you for your note of February 22, 2021 in which you wrote that you are “concerned” about anti-Semitism in our country.
I don’t think that I can add to your awareness of this. You have had, for example, a friend of mine in the news, a woman named Maura Healey who is the first female Attorney General of Massachusetts and a Jew.
The New York Times reported that “she is the second Jew in the United States to hold statewide elected office. She is also the highest-ranking Jewish elected official in the country.”
You have also had, for example, a Jewish man who won the Super Bowl and is now a quarterback in the National Football League.

Russian President Vladimir Putin denied on Wednesday that he was involved in the regime of Alexander Lukashenko, who has been in power in Belarus since 1994, but his comments are unlikely to have much impact on Western perceptions of the Kremlin's relations with the former Soviet republic.
According to Reuters, Mr Putin, in his first public appearance since the death of his predecessor, Dmitry Medvedev, said that the Kremlin had nothing to do with the arrest and subsequent expulsion of Belarusian journalist Roman Protasevich from Poland, after his plane was forced to land in Minsk. The Kremlin is accused of complicity in the forced landing of the plane by the Polish authorities. ""That is simply untrue. There is no involvement of Russia or any of its agencies,"" Mr Putin said in response to a question on his relationship with Mr Lukashenko.

berejiklian says its unlikely lockdown will be lifted early,26 June 2021,"26 June 2021 - berejiklian says its unlikely lockdown will be lifted early
The Berejiklian government's 'roadmap' is more of a speedbump.
Premier Gladys Berejiklian has announced a new roadmap out of lockdown, but it’s more of a speedbump. It’s the same as the previous roadmap and the one before that. 
There are no plans for the lifting of lockdown early, despite the easing of restrictions in South Australia and the ACT.
While there are plans for a ‘return to normal’ from 1 July, there’s no end date for the lockdown in sight. 
There are still no plans to allow families to reunite for Father’s Day on 5 July.
And we’re still a long way off a return to our workplaces. It’s not clear when the 70% vaccination target will be met, so the lifting of lockdown is not likely until September. 
The Premier said there was “no point” in relaxing restrictions before the July 1 target, and the 70% vaccination target","

omicron takes hold in london,14 December 2021,"14 December 2021 - omicron takes hold in london
This is what it looked like when I took my bike for a spin yesterday.
This was on the way home yesterday, from an eventful evening. This is the area around the Elephant and Castle.
And this is a view of the Shard on a clear day.
And on the way home I passed this pub that was built in 1798. It has 17 rooms, some of which are Grade II listed. I couldn't resist.
The pub was also known as the Prince Regent, after George III's son, Prince George, later to become George IV.
And when I got home, I discovered that the Omicron variant has taken hold in London.
It was only a matter of time before it did.

That was a nice walk around London.
Thanks! And I'm glad you were in England when I did that walk.","
